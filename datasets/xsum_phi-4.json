    "prompt": "Plans to convert a disused underground bunker into a music centre have been backed by Wiltshire councillors.",
    "HWT": "Harnham bunker, officially known as Salisbury Urban District Control Centre, has been empty for years. Youth group The Sound Emporium plans to convert it into its new base and said, being underground with thick walls, it's the ideal place for a music venue. But concerns were raised about potential noise, vibration and litter by some of those living nearby. Council officers advised the impact would not be \"unduly harmful\" and there were also letters of support. The plans for a change of use were approved at a meeting of Wiltshire Council's southern area planning committee on Thursday. Ross Sanderson, of the Sound Emporium, told the BBC the venue was \"unique\" and \"inspiring\". \"What better place to have a music venue than underground, with the natural soundproofing of the earth plus between 5ft-10ft thick concrete walls?\" Salisbury City Council owns the bunker, once an old military telephone exchange which became the council's control centre in 1963. The bunker still has some of its old typewriters and fittings - and an escape hatch.",
    "MGT": "Wiltshire councillors have approved plans to transform a disused underground bunker into a vibrant music centre. The proposal aims to breathe new life into the historic structure, which has remained vacant for years, by repurposing it into a cultural hub for music lovers and aspiring musicians. The development will include rehearsal spaces, recording studios, and performance venues, offering a unique underground experience.\n\nThe transformation project, supported by local government, envisions creating a community-focused space that encourages artistic expression and collaboration. It is expected to provide valuable resources for local musicians while also attracting visitors from across the region. The centre will host workshops, concerts, and events, fostering a thriving music scene.\n\nThe initiative is part of a broader strategy to revitalize the area, leveraging its rich historical backdrop to promote cultural engagement. The bunker's strategic location and existing infrastructure make it an ideal candidate for such a venture. Local music groups and educational institutions are already expressing enthusiasm about the potential opportunities the centre will offer.\n\nWith construction set to begin later this year, the project is anticipated to create jobs and stimulate the local economy. The Wiltshire music centre is poised to become a landmark destination for cultural enrichment, embodying the community's commitment to preserving history while embracing the arts.",

    "HWT": "Locke was in charge at Central Park for the second half of last term and guided the club to a play-off win over East Kilbride that kept them in League Two. Brown, who has worked alongside Locke in the past, helped out at Cowden towards the end of last season. The club say their aim remains to secure promotion next season. Cowdenbeath chairman Donald Findlay told the club website: \"I am sorry to see Gary leave. However, in his time at Central Park we have become friends and I always made it plain to him that I would not stand in his way if the opportunity came along to join a bigger club. \"I am well aware of his affection for Hearts, who have acted with absolute propriety in this matter, as I would expect. I will always be grateful for what he and Billy Brown did for the club at the end of the season and I have every confidence that Billy will carry on the good work.\" Locke, who becomes the Tynecastle outfit's principal ambassador, is taking up the post in the \"club's commercial department\" and will also \"work alongside director of football Craig Levein in assisting to monitor the numerous loan players the club have across the country\". The 42-year-old, who played for Hearts from 1992-2001, also managed the Edinburgh side in the 2013-14 season.

    "MGT": "Gary Locke has stepped down from his role as Cowdenbeath manager to take on a new position as an ambassador for Hearts.

Despite facing numerous obstacles, including financial constraints and a demanding schedule, Locke's leadership was instrumental in keeping Cowdenbeath competitive in the league. His commitment to the club was evident in his strategic approach and his ability to motivate players, earning him respect from both colleagues and fans.\n\nWith Locke moving to a role at Hearts, the club has appointed Billy Brown as the new manager of Cowdenbeath. Brown, a familiar face in Scottish football, brings a wealth of experience to the Blue Brazil.

    "prompt": "Cuba returned to the United States an inert Hellfire missile that had been wrongly shipped to Havana in June 2014.",
    "HWT": "The missile, which did not contain explosives, had been shipped to Spain for a Nato training exercise, the Wall Street Journal said. It was then taken to Germany and eventually to Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris for onward delivery to Florida. It was instead loaded on to an Air France flight to Havana. The incident could have led to a serious loss of military technology, officials told the Wall Street Journal. The whole affair has been embarrassing for the Americans, who have had to ask the Cubans if they could have their highly sensitive missile back, says the BBC's Will Grant in Havana. The missile arrived on a flight from Paris \"by mistake or mishandling in the country of origin,\" said a Cuban Foreign Ministry statement. \"Cuba acted with seriousness and transparency and co-operated to find a satisfactory solution to this issue,\" it added. The AGM 114 Hellfire is a laser-guided missile that can be deployed from an attack helicopter or an unmanned drone. US officials were worried that Cuba could share the advanced technology inside the missile with countries such as North Korea, China or Russia, sources close to the investigation told the Wall Street Journal. The US and Cuba, old Cold War enemies, restored diplomatic relations in July last year after more than 50 years. The two countries have been working to rebuild their economic and trade ties. An announcement is expected on Tuesday about the reinstatement of scores of commercial flights between US cities and Havana.",
    "MGT": "In a diplomatic move marking the end of a long-standing dispute, Cuba has returned to the United States an inert Hellfire missile that had been mistakenly sent to Havana in 2014. The incident, which involved the shipment of the missile to Cuba without the knowledge of either government, highlighted the complex and often tense relations between the two nations.\n\nThe Hellfire missile, a type of air-to-ground missile commonly used by the U.S. military, was discovered in a cargo shipment by Cuban authorities in June 2014. After initial confusion and investigations, it was confirmed that the shipment was an error, and that the missile had not been intended for Cuba. The incident sparked a series of diplomatic exchanges between the two countries, as both sought to resolve the situation amicably.\n\nThe return of the missile was facilitated by the U.S. State Department, which worked closely with Cuban officials to ensure its safe and secure handover. This resolution comes as part of broader efforts to normalize relations between the United States and Cuba, which have seen gradual improvements in recent years.\n\nThe return of the missile was seen as a positive step towards building trust and cooperation between the two nations. It underscored the potential for constructive engagement and dialogue, despite the historical tensions that have long characterized U.S.-Cuba relations. Both countries have expressed a commitment to continuing their diplomatic efforts, aiming to address outstanding issues and explore new areas of collaboration.\n\nWhile the incident served as a reminder of the complexities inherent in U.S.-Cuba relations, the successful resolution reflects a mutual willingness to move beyond past grievances.

    "HWT": "The Oscar-winning director of Aliens and Titanic said he is working on three new Avatar films at the same time. The first film was supposed to be out in December 2016, but Cameron said writing the stories had become \"very involved\". \"There's a layer of complexity in getting the story to work as a saga across three films,\" he explained. Cameron said the goal was to have the scripts for the three movies completed by the end of this month so that filming can begin. \"We're writing three simultaneously and we've done that so that everything tracks throughout the three films,\" he told the Associated Press. \"We're not just going to do one and then make up another one and another one after that. \"And parallel with that, we're doing all the design. So we've designed all the creatures and the environments.\" Cameron said he thought it was important that each film linked forward to the next one in a satisfying way, but also came to a resolution that did not leave the audience hanging. The three films will be shot in New Zealand, where some of the original film was also made. Avatar is the highest-grossing film in history, with box office takings of almost $2.8 billion (Â£1.8 billion). Set in the 22nd Century on a distant planet inhabited by a humanoid race, the sci-fi epic went on to win three Oscars.

Bournemouth Crown Court heard Joy won the trust of the pensioner, who died earlier this month, when she hired him as her gardener in 2008. He was entrusted to withdraw money for her daily living expenses. In December 2014 he made the first of 107 withdrawals without her knowledge, totalling £32,100. The following November Ms Brady cashed five bonds in the sum of £230,000 and wrote Joy a cheque for £100,000. In March 2016, he received a further £20,000 cheque. He also withdrew money to buy a Land Rover car and set up a direct debit to pay his vehicle insurance. The offences came to light when the pensioner's relatives checked her finances while she was in hospital. In a statement, Ms Brady's family said they were \"desperately sad\" about the \"ugly end\" to her life. Det Insp Andy Dilworth said: \"Russell Joy is nothing more than a callous fraudster.

    "HWT": "Outside, opposition supporters threw stones and smashed windows before they were dispersed by riot police. Protesters have been trying to disrupt parliament over an EU-brokered deal to improve relations with Serbia. Kosovo unilaterally declared its independence from Serbia in 2008. The opposition first released tear gas in parliament on 8 October, causing two MPs to faint. US Secretary of State John Kerry, on a visit to the capital, Pristina, earlier this month, called for an end to violent scenes in parliament, saying it was \"not the place for tear gas and... not the place for intimidation\". However, opposition MPs released gas canisters again in the parliamentary chamber on Monday, forcing a suspension of proceedings. A large group of plainclothes police officers donned gas masks as the chamber was cleared. One of the MPs who released the gas, Glauk Konjufca, said it was \"a collective action by the opposition\". \"Others have done this too, and we will continue to do this in the future. Our breaching of the law is nothing compared to the damage that is being done by these agreements.\" The opposition is particularly opposed to a deal to give more autonomy to Kosovo's ethnic Serb minority, which they say could increase Serbia's influence. The vote on next year's €1.67bn (£1.1bn) budget resumed in a side room, with only MPs from the governing coalition present and was approved, Reuters news agency reported. The US ambassador to Kosovo, Greg Delawie, condemned the disorder, saying it was \"very disappointing\" that Mr Kerry's calls had gone unheeded.",

The latest incident saw MPs dousing the parliamentary chamber with tear gas canisters, forcing an immediate evacuation and suspension of the session. \n\nThe unrest stems from a series of controversial decisions taken by the coalition government, including the recent establishment of a special court tasked with investigating war crimes. Critics argue that the court, which is to be funded by the European Union and the United States, undermines Kosovo's sovereignty and targets former Kosovo Liberation Army members, including Prime Minister Ramush Haradinaj.\n\nIn response to the unrest, the government has condemned the opposition's tactics, accusing them of undermining democratic processes and stability in the country. \"Such actions are unacceptable and only serve to destabilize our democratic institutions,\" stated a government spokesperson. \"We urge all parties to engage in constructive dialogue and work towards the common good.\"\n\nThe repeated use of tear gas in parliament has drawn criticism from both domestic and international observers, who are concerned about the implications for Kosovo's fledgling democracy.

Sales to GB were up by 6.2% while sales to the Republic of Ireland were up by 5.3%. However sales to other EU countries fell by 13%. The figures are produced by the  Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency (NISRA). Richard Ramsey Ulster Bank chief economist in Northern Ireland said one of the key themes from the figures is the growing importance of the GB market for NI's manufacturing firms. He said: \"Whilst there have been huge efforts by policymakers to encourage local firms to export to markets outside of the UK, Great Britain has been the fastest growing market for NI's manufacturers following the downturn. \"Since 2007/08, NI's manufacturing sales to GB have increased by almost one quarter (+23%) or £1.5bn. \"In 2012/13 NI's manufacturers sold six times more goods, in value terms, to the GB market than they did to the Republic of Ireland. \"Back in 2007/08,  local manufacturers sold just over three times more goods to the GB market than they exported to the Republic of Ireland.\"",

Shaas al-M faces charges of being a member of a foreign terrorist organisation, which carries up to 10 years in jail, and violating laws governing military weapons. In a previous statement (in German), the court detailed allegations of Shaas al-M's involvement in IS operations in Syria, including participating in the siege of the airport at Deir al-Zour, handling a Kalashnikov gun and helping supply fighters with food. Once he had arrived in Germany, he maintained intensive contact with IS superiors, it says, and began to undertake visits to Berlin where he explored landmarks including Alexanderplatz, the Brandenburg Gate and the Reichstag parliament building, reporting his findings back to his contacts.

Ms Pow called for a debate to be held to \"celebrate and discuss this wonderful anniversary\". \"Perhaps he [Chris Grayling] might find a little pot of money to restore the wonderful Wellington Monument which is in so need of an upgrade,\" she said. In response Mr Grayling said he did not have the budget to pay for the work but \"there will be many opportunities to lobby those of my colleagues who do have such a budget\".",
    "MGT": "Taunton Deane's MP, Rebecca Pow, has called on the government to provide funding for the restoration of the Wellington Monument in honor of the 200th anniversary of the Battle of Waterloo. The monument, a significant local landmark, commemorates the victory of the Duke of Wellington and is a symbol of the area's historical ties to this pivotal moment in European history.\n\nThe Wellington Monument, erected in 1828, stands as a testament to the courage and leadership that defined the battle, which took place on June 18, 1815. However, years of weathering and neglect have left the monument in a state of disrepair, prompting urgent calls for restoration. MP Pow believes that securing government support is crucial to preserving this piece of heritage for future generations.\n\nHighlighting the monument's cultural and historical importance, Pow has emphasized that its restoration would not only honor the legacy of the Battle of Waterloo but also serve as a focal point for community pride and tourism. The call for funding comes at a critical time, as the anniversary approaches, offering an opportunity to celebrate and reflect on the impact of the battle in shaping modern Europe.\n\nCommunity leaders and historians have expressed strong support for the initiative, urging swift action to ensure the monument is restored in time for the bicentennial celebrations. The restoration project promises to rejuvenate a cherished landmark, allowing it to continue standing as a proud reminder of an era-defining victory.",

Read more about the celebrations. Edinburgh held its customary Hogmanay street party, culminating in a shower of fireworks over the castle. Around 75,000 people from across the world could be heard counting down the final moments of 2014 in Edinburgh before joining in a mass rendition of Auld Lang Syne. The traditional torchlight procession through the streets of the Scottish capital included men dressed as Shetland vikings. Revellers also flocked to London in their thousands to see the fireworks display along the Thames. The sky was illuminated in pink over the London Eye. It was the first year attendees have had to buy tickets to watch the fireworks in central London - a step which London Mayor Boris Johnson said would help ensure the safety of the 100,000-strong crowd. Although attendance was kept at lower levels than in previous years in London, the clean-up operation in London will last well into 1 January. Fireworks marked the unveiling of a Rugby World Cup 2015 emblem over the River Tyne in Newcastle, one of the tournament's 11 host cities.

    "prompt": "Japan's authorities have seized the passport of a journalist planning to travel to Syria, local media say.",
    "HWT": "It was necessary to confiscate Yuichi Sugimoto's passport in order to protect his life, the authorities said. The 59-year-old photographer, who had planned to enter Syria on 27 February, described the move as a threat to the freedom of press. Two Japanese hostages were killed by Islamic State (IS) militants in Syria in January. However, Mr Sugimoto told reporters that he had no intention to visit areas controlled by IS. It is said to be the first time the Japanese government has taken such a step. The foreign ministry says it is in accordance with a provision in the country's passport law, that allows a confiscation in order to protect the passport holder's life. Mr Sugimoto, who has covered conflict zones in Iraq and Syria before, insists he has always taken precautions and retreated when in danger. \"What happens to my freedom to travel and freedom of the press?\" he told the Japanese paper Asahi Shimbun. He said he was planning to travel to Turkey before entering Syria with a former soldier who had previously worked for Kenji Goto, a fellow journalist who was taken hostage, and killed in Syria last month. A second Japanese citizen, Haruna Yukawa, was also kidnapped and killed by IS militants. After the handling of the hostage crisis, approval ratings for the government of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe have gone up, recent polls show. Two separate surveys conducted by the Yomiuri newspaper and Japan's news agency Kyodo indicate that up to 60% of people approve of the way the government dealt with the crisis. A similar percentage also said Japan's support to countries affected IS should continue to be non-military. In January, Mr Abe promised $200m (Â£130m) in non-military aid for countries fighting Islamic State. Officials said that much of the $200m fund would be focused on helping refugees displaced from Syria and Iraq.",

However, before the trip could commence, Japanese authorities intervened, confiscating the passport under unspecified security concerns. This action has raised eyebrows within the media community, with many questioning the balance between national security and the freedom of the press.\n\nThe incident has been met with criticism from various media organizations and press freedom advocates. They argue that such actions could set a concerning precedent for journalists who wish to report on international conflicts firsthand.

    "HWT": "Glasgow's Bennett, 23 on Wednesday, was due to resume contact work on Monday after suffering a shoulder injury against Racing 92 three weeks ago. \"It's his first day in terms of contact, so he's back in the mix,\" said Scotland assistant coach Matt Taylor. \"I think he has a good chance but he'll have to put his best foot forward.\" Bennett has scored six tries in 13 Tests and was one of the stand-out performers in Scotland's World Cup campaign last autumn. With fellow Glasgow centres Alex Dunbar, Peter Horne and Richie Vernon all ruled out of at least the start of the Six Nations - or in Vernon's case, the entire Championship - Bennett's possible availability would be a major boost. \"A fully-fit Bennett is a very good player,\" Taylor noted. \"There is a reason he played so well in the World Cup, so it is great he is back in the mix.\" Scotland wing Sean Maitland has also been declared fully fit after coming through a full game for London Irish on the weekend. But Harlequins wing Tim Visser is still a \"couple of weeks off\" and unlikely to be available before Scotland's third Six Nations match against Italy in Rome. With Matt Scott likely to start at inside centre, Bennett is competing with Saracens' Duncan Taylor for the number 13 jersey against England. The in-form Taylor has been a vital source of intelligence on England's likely defensive set-up, with new Red Rose assistant coach Paul Gustard set to bring his famed 'wolf-pack' approach from Saracens into the national squad. \"I think Duncan is caught between a rock and a hard place,\" grinned Taylor. \"He feels like he has been giving out all this information on how Saracens, and now England, are defending. That is hard when there are other guys in our group from the likes of Gloucester and Bath who can benefit. \"But that is international rugby. We have been talking about how they defend and Duncan gives us an insight into what to expect. But we will be trying to concentrate on what we do.\"",

Bennett's recovery has been closely monitored, and the Scottish squad is optimistic about his chances of making a comeback in what promises to be a thrilling encounter at Twickenham.\n\nMark Bennett, known for his creativity and pace, has been a vital component of Scotland's backline. His ability to break the line and create opportunities for his teammates has made him a standout performer in recent seasons. Unfortunately, his absence due to injury was felt during the latter stages of last year's tournament, when Scotland was pushing hard to secure a spot in the upcoming World Cup.\n\nThe news of Bennett's return comes at a crucial time for the Scottish team. They are eager to make a strong statement against England, a team they have historically found challenging to defeat. Scotland's head coach, Gregor Townsend, expressed optimism about Bennett's recovery, stating that he is \"fit and raring to go\" and that there is a \"good chance\" he will be available for selection.\n\nBennett's return adds depth and options to Scotland's backline, particularly in the centre position where he has formed a formidable partnership with Huw Jones. His presence could prove pivotal in Scotland's strategy to outmaneuver England's defense, which has been robust and disciplined. The Scottish team is known for its attacking flair, and Bennett's inclusion could enhance their ability to exploit gaps and maintain pressure on the English defense.\n\nIn preparation for the game, Bennett has been working closely with the medical and coaching staff to ensure a seamless transition back into competitive play. His progress in training sessions has been promising, showcasing his fitness and sharpness. This has been a relief for the coaching staff, who have been keen to reintegrate him into the squad without risking further injury.\n\nWhile Bennett's participation is not guaranteed, his potential inclusion adds an exciting dynamic to the team's preparations.

Bennett's ability to read the game and execute skillful plays will be crucial in disrupting England's defensive setup.\n\nAs the match approaches, anticipation builds among fans and players alike.

    "HWT": "Maria Pridmore, 36, was jailed for three years in August after she admitted a string of frauds. They included obtaining more than £16,000 in housing benefit, council tax benefit and income support. Pridmore, who was described in court as a \"Walter Mitty\" fraudster, also stole over £30,000 from four women. She appeared by video-link at Lincoln Crown Court from Drake Hall prison in Staffordshire where she is serving her sentence. The court heard Pridmore, a former drug addict, benefitted by £56,679 from her crimes but had no available assets which could be confiscated to pay back her victims. Judge Simon Hirst ruled that in the circumstances a nominal sum of £1 should be paid. Pridmore made news in 2012 when she gave birth to a daughter after previously suffering 14 miscarriages, a stillbirth and the death of an infant son. At her sentence hearing, the court heard the former nurse had been claiming to be a lone-parent with dependent children in order to get benefits, but at various times failed to declare she had moved or was living with her then partner as man and wife. Pridmore also pocketed more than £30,000 from friends and two elderly women, and used the bank details of one of her victims to pay for a £60 taxi fare to attend a court hearing. She stole almost £8,000 from one victim, an 84-year-old vulnerable woman. Pridmore, of Angel Lane, Holbeach, Lincolnshire, previously admitted seven charges of benefit fraud between August 2010 and March 2013, 19 charges of fraud and theft between January 2013 and May 2016 and stealing her father's flat-packed kitchen in April 2015.",

Furthermore, she targeted individuals in vulnerable positions, exacerbating the harm caused to those already struggling.\n\nDespite the evidence presented, her defense argued for leniency, citing personal hardships and previous good conduct. The court, however, determined that the crime's impact on the community and the victims warranted a sentence that included a token repayment as a symbolic gesture of accountability.\n\nThe judge's decision to mandate a £1 repayment has been met with widespread criticism.

The authority is looking at increasing council tax by 3.7% and making cuts of £17m. Costs for burials as well as births, deaths and marriage registration and school meals could all rise in 2017-18.

    "HWT": "Mr Hammarskjold died in a plane crash in what is now Zambia in 1961, but the cause of the crash has been disputed. There have been claims that the plane was shot down, but a previous UN enquiry did not reach a definitive conclusion. The Swedish diplomat was on his way to negotiate a ceasefire in the breakaway Congolese state of Katanga. He was trying to mediate between Congo's Soviet-backed government and Moise Tshombe, who had declared independence for the mineral-rich province of Katanga. He was flying to Ndola, in what was then Northern Rhodesia, to meet Mr Tshombe, who was backed by former colonial power Belgium and some Western mining interests. The UN set up this new enquiry after a group of independent investigators said that there was significant new evidence concerning Hammarskjold's death. They said the evidence was \"persuasive\" that \"the aircraft was subjected to some form of attack\". The commission said that the US National Security Agency (NSA) might hold crucial evidence. It said that given the NSA's worldwide monitoring activities at that time, \"it is highly likely\" that the radio traffic on 18-19 September 1961 was recorded by the NSA and possibly also by the CIA. The report said: \"Authenticated recordings of any such cockpit narrative or radio messages, if located, would furnish potentially conclusive evidence of what happened.\" The UN panel will now assess this new information and report back by the end of June.",

    "HWT": "The new buzzwords are to be \"outcomes\" and \"indicators\". They are words most people living in Scotland or Finland will be very familiar with. Because Stormont's administrators have been studying what happens in those countries and they like what they see. Scotland has a series of sixteen National Outcomes which describe what the Government there wants to do over the next ten years. This so-called outcomes based approach to government focuses on actual results achieved. The theory is it allows the government and wider public sector to focus on making sustainable improvements to public services and the quality of life for people in Scotland. A series of indicators allow them to track progress towards the achievements of these outcomes. Sources close to the negotiations for a programme for government at Stormont say this is the model they intend to follow. One source said it is about \"doing things differently\" and denied the change was merely cosmetic. As a first step a \"framework\" programme for government will be produced in just over a fortnight. It will then go out to consultation. At the end of this year it will be replaced with a detailed programme for government. There will also be a budget, not for one year but for the next three to four years. And there will be documents setting out strategies on the economy, capital investment and social policy strategy. Sources say this is not a programme for one Assembly mandate but for a 10 - 15 year period. They say it will also require the civil service to be \"more outward facing.\" Politically, this seems the model Sinn FÃ©in and the DUP intend to move forward with - with or without the other parties. Can the SDLP, Ulster Unionists and Alliance agree to go into the next Executive on the basis of a \"framework\"  programme knowing they won't get the real detail for another seven months?",
    "MGT": "Stormont is on the verge of a significant transformation as plans to overhaul its system of government gain momentum. This impending makeover aims to address longstanding criticisms of inefficacy and to better serve Northern Ireland's diverse population. The initiative is part of a broader effort to refresh and modernize governance structures to ensure they meet contemporary demands.\n\nThe overhaul was set in motion following extensive consultations with political leaders, civil society, and the public. This inclusive process has highlighted the need for a more streamlined and accountable system. Currently, Stormont's governance has been hampered by frequent suspensions and political stalemates, which have undermined public confidence and hindered effective administration.\n\nKey aspects of the proposed reforms include reducing the number of departments, simplifying decision-making processes, and enhancing transparency and accountability. By consolidating departments, the government hopes to create a more cohesive and efficient administrative body. This restructuring is expected to facilitate clearer communication channels and more decisive governance, reducing bureaucratic delays that have plagued decision-making in the past.\n\nAdditionally, the reforms aim to bolster the role of the assembly in scrutinizing government actions. Enhanced powers for committees and more robust mechanisms for public engagement are central to these changes. The goal is to ensure that government actions are closely monitored and that citizens have a more direct voice in shaping policy.\n\nThe proposed changes also emphasize the need for a more collaborative approach to governance. Recognizing Northern Ireland's unique political landscape, the reforms seek to foster greater cooperation between parties. This approach is intended to bridge divides and encourage consensus-building, which are crucial for addressing complex issues such as health, education, and economic development.\n\nWhile the proposed changes have garnered broad support, there are concerns about implementation and potential resistance from entrenched interests.

    "prompt": "California Governor Jerry Brown has signed into law a ban on therapy aimed at making gay teenagers straight.",
    "HWT": "When the law comes into effect on 1 January, the Golden State will become the first to outlaw the practice for people under the age of 18. The bill was backed by mental health groups, and gay rights activists say reparative or \"conversion therapy\" can increase risk of depression or suicide. Counselling and prayer is used to help some Christians deal with gay urges. The bill was signed over the weekend along with more than 100 pieces of legislation sent to the governor by California's state legislature. Two Christian groups, the California-based Pacific Justice Institute and the Florida-based Liberty Counsel will challenge the law. The Liberty Counsel said it planned to argue in its lawsuit that the measure infringes on the First Amendment and equal protection rights. In his statement, Gov Brown said sexual orientation change efforts \"have no basis in science or medicine and they will now be relegated to the dustbin of quackery\". The Human Rights Campaign, an advocacy group, said: \"We're grateful to Governor Brown for standing with California's children. \"LGBT [lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender] youth will now be protected from a practice that has not only been debunked as junk science, but has been proven to have drastically negative effects on their well-being,\" the gay rights advocate added, urging other states to take up similar measures. But the National Association for Research and Therapy on Homosexuality said the bill was a \"legislative over-reach\". Some conservative groups have said banning the therapy would restrict a parent's right to care for children going through gender confusion. California is embroiled in a long-standing legal tussle over gay marriage. A law called Proposition 8 banned same-sex marriage in California just months after it had been introduced. But a court overturned the ban in 2010. After an appeal was upheld, the matter may now come before the US Supreme Court for a final ruling.",
    "MGT": "In a landmark move for LGBTQ+ rights, California Governor Jerry Brown has signed into law a ban on so-called \"conversion therapy\" aimed at changing the sexual orientation of gay teenagers. This significant legislation marks a major step forward in the fight against practices widely discredited by major medical organizations and seen as harmful to young individuals.\n\nThe new law, known as Senate Bill 1172, makes it illegal for therapists, as well as other mental health providers, to use conversion therapy on minors. This practice, which attempts to alter an individual's sexual orientation or gender identity, has been denounced by numerous health professionals, including the American Psychological Association and the American Medical Association, as ineffective and potentially damaging.\n\nGovernor Brown emphasized that the legislation is aimed at protecting youth from being subjected to practices that can lead to depression, anxiety, and other mental health issues. \"The state of California has a responsibility to protect minors from unscrupulous individuals who would seek to harm them through these dangerous practices,\" Brown stated in a press release.\n\nSupporters of the bill have long argued that conversion therapy not only lacks scientific validity but also promotes a message of shame and stigma towards LGBTQ+ individuals. The law is expected to prevent many young people from experiencing the psychological trauma associated with these discredited practices.\n\nSenator Ted Lieu, a co-author of the bill, expressed relief and satisfaction with its passage: \"This law will save lives by ending a practice that has been proven harmful to countless young people. We must ensure that all children in California are treated with the dignity and respect they deserve.\"\n\nThe legislation stipulates that any licensed mental health provider found in violation of the law could face disciplinary action, including the revocation of their license. This underscores the state's commitment to enforcing the ban and safeguarding the well-being of its youth.\n\nWhile California is the first state to enact such a comprehensive ban, advocates hope this will set a precedent for other states to follow. Conversion therapy bans have been passed in several states, but this is the first to cover all forms of mental health providers, thereby closing loopholes that previously allowed certain practitioners to continue the practice.\n\nOpponents of the bill, however, argue that it infringes on parental rights and the freedom of speech of therapists. Despite these objections, the overwhelming support from health professionals and LGBTQ+ advocacy groups has underscored the necessity and urgency of the legislation.\n\nAs California takes this bold step, it joins a growing movement to affirm and protect the rights of LGBTQ+ individuals, ensuring that all young people can grow up free from harmful and unscientific attempts to change their fundamental identities.",

    "HWT": "Sean Sullivan, 20, had only passed his test the day before the crash which killed Timothy Malone near Cefn Bryn Common, Gower, on 31 July 2016. Swansea Crown Court heard Sullivan had ignored pleas from his passengers to slow down. He pleaded guilty to one count of death by dangerous driving and one of causing serious injury by dangerous driving. Sullivan also admitted two other charges of dangerous driving involving two other drivers. Prosecuting, Ian Wright said airbag data from Sullivan's car showed four seconds before impact, it was travelling at 98mph and the throttle was at 100% at 5,000 revs. \"Essentially, his foot was touching the floorboard,\" he said. The court heard Mr Malone, who was was staying in a nearby caravan with his wife, Yvonne Howard, was unable to take evasive action or avoid the head on collision on the country road. Addressing Sullivan in court, Mrs Howard said: \"I am haunted by the images of the terrible events of that night - the last time I saw him. \"I cannot heal my tattered heart and soul. I go to sleep in sadness and wake up to sadness. My face is wet with tears every day.\" Judge Peter Heywood sentenced Sullivan to five years in a young offenders' institution. He will also be banned from driving for four years following his release. Speaking after the case, Inspector Steve Davies of South Wales Police, said: \"Our thoughts, as ever, are with the family and friends of Timothy Malone who lost his life in such devastating circumstances at Cefn Bryn in Gower, last summer. \"This tragic loss of the life has once again highlighted the consequences of a young and inexperienced driver, driving at excessive speed, which puts drivers, passengers and innocent road users at risk of serious injury or death.\"",

    "prompt": "A 19th Century engine building used to pump water out of a Denbighshire mine is being restored.",
    "HWT": "Clive Engine House has stood unused for more than 120 years after serving Talargoch Mine in Dyserth until 1884. Now county archaeologists have secured funds to repair the building, which has been affected by weathering over the decades. It was opened to the public on Friday to show how work is progressing. Denbighshire council archaeologist Fiona Gale said: \"It was a fantastic, once in a lifetime opportunity to repair the building and bring it back into good order\". Built in 1860, the Cornish engine house was home to a steam cylinder which powered water extraction pumps. Lead extraction is thought to have taken place at Talargoch since the Roman period. It has also produced copper, silver and calamine, but it is most famous as a producer of lead and zinc ore. The engine house is one of the few remaining signs of what was once a large and important industry in the area. The engine was in operation until the mine closed in 1884 when the engine was sold to the former Westminster Colliery in Wrexham. David Thomas, the Denbighshire cabinet lead member for regeneration, said the building was a \"testament to the hard work of all those who worked in the lead mines in the area over many years\". Grants from funders WREN and Cadw are paying for repair work which is being co-ordinated by Denbighshire council.",
    "MGT": "In a bid to preserve a vital piece of industrial heritage, a 19th-century engine building used to pump water out of a mine in Denbighshire is undergoing a meticulous restoration. This historic structure, integral to the local mining operations, is set to be revitalized to its former glory, offering a glimpse into the region's rich industrial past.\n\nThe engine building, part of a once-thriving mining community, played a crucial role in the mine's operations by ensuring the efficient removal of water, a common challenge in mining during that era. The restoration project aims to maintain the authenticity of the original construction while incorporating modern conservation techniques to ensure its longevity.\n\nLocal historians and conservationists are collaborating on the project, emphasizing the significance of preserving such structures not only for their historical value but also for their educational potential. The restored engine house is anticipated to become a focal point for educational tours, allowing visitors to explore the mechanics and ingenuity behind the engine that once powered the mine.\n\nFunding for the restoration is being sourced from a combination of public grants and private donations, reflecting the community's commitment to safeguarding its industrial heritage. Local authorities have expressed optimism that the restored building will attract tourism and provide educational opportunities for schools and researchers interested in industrial history.\n\nAs the project progresses, specialists are carefully examining the structure to ensure that all original materials are preserved where possible.

    "prompt": "An e-book at the centre of a row over who can use the term \"space marine\" is back on sale on the Amazon website.",
    "HWT": "The Spots the Space Marine story was taken off Amazon after model-soldier maker Games Workshop complained it infringed its trademark on the phrase. A blog post about the row by the story's US author, Maggie Hogarth, led to much criticism for Games Workshop. And digital rights group the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) said it had then helped Amazon \"review\" the case. In a statement about the row, the EFF said it was \"outrageous\" for Games Workshop to claim any rights over a term that had been in wide use in fiction since the 1930s. It said the case was an example of a growing trend, in which trademark and rights owners targeted the \"weakest link\" in the chain of people that helped content, be it fiction, movies or music, appear online. Often, said the EFF, the weakest link was an ISP, a hosting company or a website that acted as a store front or aggregator for many different creators. Such \"providers usually don't have the resources and/or the inclination to investigate trademark infringement claims\", it said. Many simply removed the disputed content immediately to stay \"neutral\" and avoid trouble, said the EFF, but that made it hard for those on the end of trademark claims to mount a challenge. The online chatter also prompted Games Workshop to put a statement about the row on its Facebook page, in which it said it had \"no choice\" but to act in cases where its trademarks in a commercially available product were being used without its consent. Despite this, it said, it had never claimed to have rights over the ways in which the terms \"warhammer\" or \"space marine\" were used in day-to-day speech. This everyday use also covered a \"body of prose\", it added. \"Trademarks as opposed to use of a word in prose or everyday language are two very different things,\" it said. \"Games Workshop is always vigilant in protecting the former, but never makes any claim to owning the latter.\"",

The publisher claimed that the use of \"space marine\" in the book's title infringed on their trademark since they had published a series under a similar name.

    "HWT": "It all started when the head of Israel's association of tour operators posted a photo of the bill, suggesting the visitors may have been \"suckered\". But the restaurant's owners contest this, and give a different version of how the meal unfolded. They say the group had a gourmet meal and the venue was closed to host them. The bill, from the popular Abu Ghosh restaurant on the outskirts of West Jerusalem, allegedly included 5,900 shekels in alcohol, 4,000 shekels for the use of the private room and 3,150 shekels for the main course. On top of what was consumed by the group, there was a service charge of 1,500 shekels. In a post on Facebook (in Hebrew) with a picture of the bill, Yossi Fatael, chairman of the Israel Incoming Tour Operators Association, said the group's tourist agent confirmed they had paid the bill. \"There may be a billion Chinese, but they may not all be suckers,\" he said. \"This is how we are destroying our own budding potential of the Chinese market in Israel.\" But Jawdat Ibrahim, one of Abu Ghosh's owners, disputed this. He said, also on Facebook (in Hebrew), the group had a gourmet meal that lasted for eight hours, with special desserts, specially ordered alcoholic drinks and artists - and that the restaurant was closed to the public to host them. He also said the eight had insisted on paying the service charge. The post had pictures of what he said was the specially produced decoration to host the group. The Chinese visitors have not been identified. Some 6,900 Chinese tourists visited Israel in July, according to the Central Bureau of Statistics.

    "HWT": "Cyprus was the only crisis-hit eurozone country to restrict capital transfers, as it faced a run on the banks. The controls were eased in January. There will no longer be a monthly cap of €20,000 (£15,000; $22,000) on transfers by individuals to foreign banks, or of €10,000 for travellers moving money out of the country. Cyprus received a €10bn bailout from the EU and International Monetary Fund (IMF) after its biggest banks nearly collapsed in March 2013 because of huge losses on their Greek investments. The island's second-biggest lender, Cyprus Popular Bank (also known as Laiki Bank), was wound up and deposits worth more than €100,000 in the largest bank, Bank of Cyprus, were seized. Those measures were part of the deal to ensure that Cyprus funded part of the €10bn bailout. Speaking on Friday, Cyprus President Nicos Anastasiades voiced confidence that the Mediterranean island was recovering well, despite three years of recession. Lifting capital controls, he said, was \"a vote of confidence in our banking system which, now fully independent of Greek banking institutions, can move forward\". The Greek debt crisis had a severe impact on Cypriot banks, which lost about €4.5bn worth of Greek sovereign bonds - equivalent to 25% of Cypriot gross domestic product, Reuters news agency reports.",
    "MGT": "Cyprus has officially lifted the final capital controls it imposed on its banking system during the 2013 financial crisis, marking a significant milestone in the country's economic recovery. This move is expected to restore full freedom of capital movement within the eurozone, bolstering confidence in Cyprus's financial sector.\n\nThe controls, initially introduced in March 2013, were implemented to prevent a bank run and the potential collapse of the financial system following a severe banking crisis. These restrictions included limits on cash withdrawals and transfers abroad, as well as capital controls on the movement of funds, affecting both businesses and individuals.\n\nWith the removal of these controls, businesses can now engage in cross-border transactions without restrictions, facilitating smoother operations and trade. For individuals, this means unrestricted access to their financial assets, both domestically and abroad, enhancing personal financial mobility.\n\nThe lifting of controls is seen as a testament to the resilience and recovery of Cyprus's economy, which has made significant strides since the crisis. The government, in collaboration with international bodies, implemented reforms aimed at stabilizing and strengthening the financial sector, restoring investor confidence.\n\nThe Central Bank of Cyprus assured that the banking system remains robust, well-capitalized, and capable of withstanding economic fluctuations. The end of these restrictions is anticipated to attract more foreign investment and boost economic growth, positioning Cyprus as a more competitive player in the European and global markets.\n\nWhile challenges remain, the successful removal of capital controls is a crucial step toward full economic normalization, signaling to the world that Cyprus has overcome one of the most challenging periods in its financial history.",

    "HWT": "The 21-month-old from Sheffield went missing during a family holiday in 1991. Following a suggestion he may have been killed and buried on the island a fresh excavation of farmland began on Monday. The four or five graves are believed to date from 1,500 years ago but police said the discovery would not hamper the investigation. Forensic archaeologists have said they are confident the search is being conducted at exactly the right depth of soil relevant to 25 years ago. The digging has concentrated on an area around a waste tank. Nutrients found in the soil have indicated human traces and a full analysis of soil samples will be carried out. Officers have said they believe the material will most likely relate to a nearby cess tank. Danny Savage, BBC correspondent in Kos The graves found in Kos are all believed to contain the remains of adults. They are lying head to toe close to the boundary of the olive grove where the dig is taking place. Work will continue around them and police said the ancient discovery was not unexpected. There was initial concern from Greek locals that this would have hindered progress at the site but I have been told by the investigating team here in Kos that is not the case. The site being searched is on land where Ben was last seen playing while his grandfather was renovating a property 25 years ago. The Needham family have always believed Ben was abducted but South Yorkshire Police are now investigating whether he was accidentally run over and killed by a bulldozer.",

Gold mining saw production fall, as well as platinum and diamond mining. Workers in platinum mines have been on strike for five months. \"This makes for grim reading,\" said Razia Khan at Standard Chartered Bank. \"Mining, hit by protracted industrial unrest, fell almost 25% on an annualised basis. Manufacturing was down 4.4%.\" This is the first quarter of negative growth since the second quarter of 2009. In the final quarter of 2013, the economy grew by an annualised rate of 3.8%. The rand fell by about 1% against the dollar following the release of the figures, to 10.44 rand. Compared with a year earlier, the South African economy grew by 1.6%. GDP growth has been slowing steadily for the past three years as the economy struggles with high levels of unemployment, which currently stand at almost 25%.",
    "MGT": "South Africa's economy contracted by an annualised rate of 0.6% in the first quarter of the year, marking its worst quarterly performance in five years, according to official data released today.

Analysts have pointed to persistent power outages, known as load-shedding, as a major impediment to economic growth, affecting both industrial production and consumer confidence.\n\nMoreover, the global economic environment has posed additional challenges. Trade tensions and slowing growth in major economies have led to reduced demand for South African exports, further straining the country's economic outlook. The mining sector, a key driver of the economy, has also been affected by fluctuating commodity prices and regulatory uncertainties.\n\nDespite these setbacks, government officials and economists remain cautiously optimistic about the potential for recovery in the coming quarters.

Crusaders replied through Michael Carvill, Paul Heatley and an Aaron Smyth own goal but sub Ben Roy's 87th minute finish sealed the surprise win. Josh Robinson of Crusaders and Carrick boss Gary Haveron got late red cards. Crusaders remain five points ahead of second-placed Linfield. Defender Robinson received the red card for a crunching touchline challenge on home striker Roy. It sparked ugly scenes as players and management clashed on the side of the pitch. Rangers manager Haveron was sent to the stand for his part in the unseemly scuffle. However, the Carrick boss will have been pleased with his side as they move above Ballinamallard and into 10th place in the relegation battle. They had lost their last 13 matches against the Crues, but raced into an early lead thanks to a curling Kelly effort. Salley doubled their advantage on 29 minutes when he rifled the ball past keeper Sean O'Neill. It was the youngster's second goal since joining Rangers on loan from Linfield in January. Salley then turned provider for Carrick's third, beating Colin Coates before teeing up Harmon for a simple finish before the break. Crusaders hit back with Carvill pouncing early in the second half and, when Heatley pounced on a poor kick-out by keeper Brian Neeson to make it 3-2, the comeback looked on.

Private schooling from primary age to A-levels totals £286,000 for a day place and £468,000 for a boarder, the report from Killik and Co finds. London remains the most expensive region, with an average day school place costing £15,500 per year. The north of England and Scotland were the cheapest, at £10,400 and £10,700 respectively. In a survey of 250 parents who privately educate their children, over a third (37.2%) said they saw private education as an \"investment priority\". Of those surveyed, 34% said the attraction of smaller class sizes was a major consideration. Almost a quarter said they sent their children to private school for \"the connections my children will get\" (24.8%). Another main reason was that \"either myself or a member of my family went there\" (18%). Sarah Lord, managing director of Killik financial planners, said: \"The cost of private education is eye-watering for many families.

For some, it will make much more sense to opt for a good state school and invest the money elsewhere. \"Indeed, 14 years of day school fees from 2015 could be invested over this time to build a potential sum of around £800,000, which would help children later on in life, whether that be funding university, buying a house, or securing a comfortable retirement.\"",
    "MGT": "A recent study has highlighted the staggering financial commitment required to provide a child with 14 years of private education in the UK. The research estimates that the total cost amounts to £286,000, reflecting a significant financial undertaking for families.\n\nThe average annual cost of private schooling, which includes tuition fees, uniforms, books, and other necessary expenses, has been a growing concern for many parents. According to the study, these expenses have been steadily rising over the past decade, driven by inflation and increased operational costs for private institutions. The cumulative cost over a 14-year education trajectory underscores the financial burden faced by families seeking this educational pathway.\n\nFor those considering private education, the decision often involves weighing the perceived benefits against the substantial financial outlay. Proponents argue that private schools offer smaller class sizes, individualized attention, and superior facilities, which can contribute to enhanced academic performance and broader opportunities. However, the high cost raises questions about accessibility and equity, as not all families can afford such an investment.\n\nThe report also highlights regional variations in costs, with some areas charging significantly higher fees than others. This geographic disparity adds another layer of complexity for families deciding where to enroll their children. Additionally, the research suggests that financial aid and scholarships offered by some private schools can help mitigate costs, but these are often limited and highly competitive.\n\nThe findings have sparked a broader debate about the UK education system and the role of private schooling within it. Critics argue that the high cost of private education exacerbates social inequalities, limiting access to high-quality education for those from less affluent backgrounds. They call for policy measures to address these disparities and ensure a more equitable education landscape.\n\nAs families navigate these financial challenges, the study serves as a crucial resource in helping them make informed decisions about their children's education. It also underscores the need for ongoing dialogue about the value, accessibility, and affordability of private education in the UK.",

    "HWT": "The machine was first used to crack messages sent by Hitler and his generals on 5 February 1944. The celebration will bring together some of the machine's creators and operators at The National Museum of Computing (TNMOC). The machine's code-cracking prowess will be demonstrated on the day using the museum's rebuilt Colossus. Now widely recognised as the first electronic computer, Colossus was kept a secret for 30 years because of the sensitive work it did during World War Two to crack German codes. The work of the Colossus machines to decipher messages scrambled using the Lorenz enciphering machine that passed between the Wehrmacht's commanders is widely thought to have shortened the war and saved countless lives. Colossus was created by Post Office engineer Tommy Flowers, and his first prototype was built out of parts from telephone exchanges including 1,600 valves. Later versions used even more valves and by the end of the war 10 of the machines were in use in the UK. The celebrations will bring together some of the women who kept the different machines running as well as some of the engineers who built and maintained them. During wartime, about 550 people worked in the Bletchley Park unit that ran Colossus. Also attending will be some of the children of the machine's creators and operators. Most of the machines were broken up and the plans destroyed after the war in an attempt to keep the work secret and to conceal the fact Britain was still using two of the machines to read Soviet messages. \"The achievements of those who worked at Bletchley Park are humbling,\" said Tim Reynolds, chair of TNMOC. \"This day is in honour of all the men and women who worked on breaking the Lorenz cipher.\"",

Dozens of people, including members of the Kurdish community, held roses and framed pictures of him, as his coffin arrived at Heathrow Airport. The former chef, who had no previous military experience, joined the Kurdish armed fighting forces, the YPG, after telling his family he was going on holiday to Turkey in August. The YPG told the BBC that \"trace of a gunshot wound was found under the chin\", suggesting suicide. Staff at Heathrow were rather caught off guard as Ryan Lock's body arrived home. No-one at the cargo bay of Royal Jordanian Airlines expected to see a crowd of mourners arriving on their forecourt. With just a couple of hours notice, Kurds young and old turned out to pay tribute to a man from Chichester whom they had never met. \"This is not just a foreign war, this is a fight for humanity\", one told me. \"International solidarity\" they chant as they place flowers over the private ambulance carrying Ryan Lock's coffin. They hold their hands up in silent salute. To have a British man fight their cause, touches their hearts. A Kurdish mother kisses the ambulance and weeps as it drives away. Supporters of the YPJ female-fighting force paid tribute to Mr Lock, saying his memory would \"forever live on in our struggle for the freedom of Syria and our hope for change in the whole world\". YPG general command member Mihyedin Xirki had previously said Mr Lock was a \"martyr\" who died \"putting up a brave fight\".

    "HWT": "The Royal College of Midwives (RCM) and Public Heath Wales stressed the dangers of flu to pregnant women and reminded expectant mothers to get vaccinated. Pregnant women are more vulnerable to infections and cannot fight off flu as well as other people. Dr Richard Roberts, of Public Health Wales, said there can be \"severe complications\" for mothers and babies. Pregnant women who catch flu are more likely to deliver early, with an increased risk of stillbirth or illness for a baby in their first week. Helen Rogers, director of RCM, said it \"strongly recommends\" pregnant women have the vaccination, saying they can have it \"at any stage during their pregnancy\". \"We also urge midwives and other health professionals to have the vaccination to protect themselves, their family and the people they care for from infection as well,\" she added. Dr Richard Roberts, head of the vaccine preventable disease programme at Public Health Wales, said flu can be \"devastating for the woman and her unborn baby\". The annual flu vaccination programme aims to make sure the people who need it most get free protection each year, including those aged 65 and over and people with certain long-term health conditions, as well as pregnant women. All children aged two and three years old on 31 August 2016, and those in reception class, year one, two and three in school are also being offered protection with a nasal spray flu vaccine. Two and three-year-olds will get their spray at GP surgeries, while those up to year three will be offered the vaccine at school.",
    "MGT": "Health bodies in Wales are urging pregnant women to take advantage of a free flu vaccination this winter. The campaign, spearheaded by local health authorities, highlights the significant benefits of the flu jab in protecting both expectant mothers and their unborn children from severe complications associated with influenza.\n\nPregnancy alters the immune system, heart, and lungs, increasing the risk of severe illness from flu. For pregnant women, complications can include pneumonia, premature labor, and even severe cases that may lead to hospitalization. By getting vaccinated, mothers can protect themselves and provide antibodies to their developing babies, offering protection in the crucial early months after birth.\n\nThe flu jab is available free of charge to all pregnant women in Wales, regardless of the stage of pregnancy. Public health campaigns emphasize that the vaccine is safe and recommended at any point during pregnancy. Health officials note that in previous flu seasons, vaccination rates among pregnant women have been lower than desired, despite the clear health benefits.\n\nDr. Sarah Jones, a leading obstetrician in South Wales, stated, \"The flu jab is one of the most effective ways to protect both mother and baby. It's a simple step that can prevent serious health issues.\" She urged expectant mothers to discuss the vaccine with their healthcare providers and to take advantage of the opportunity to protect themselves and their future children.\n\nThe campaign also addresses common misconceptions, reassuring that the flu vaccine does not contain live viruses and therefore poses no risk to the baby. Health authorities are working closely with midwives and general practitioners to ensure that all pregnant women are informed about the importance of the flu vaccine.\n\nWith winter approaching, health bodies are intensifying their efforts to reach out to pregnant women through various channels, including social media, healthcare providers, and community organizations.

Juan Zuniga and Nordin Amrabat have joined Watford's lengthy injury list after suffering ankle and leg injuries respectively on Sunday. However, Hornets defender Miguel Britos returns after a one-match ban. Stoke manager Mark Hughes: \"We're giving goals up too readily. We'll address that. A lot of the elements of our play, apart from that, are very good. We had a good result against Watford not too long back. We just need to revisit our thoughts on that one and play as well as we know we can, but clearly take out the catastrophic errors.\" Watford head coach Walter Mazzarri: \"We have 50 per cent less time to prepare than Stoke.

Some of the other muppets in the collection include early versions of Cookie Monster and Oscar the Grouch. Henson's oldest puppet, Pierre the French Rat, was also donated. Jane Henson said the original characters provided five minutes of fun each night after the local news where they mostly mimed to popular music. \"I think people realized that if you put Kermit's face up there, it was just as powerful - we were mostly just doing it to entertain ourselves,\" she said. The Smithsonian already has a familiar Kermit the Frog puppet made famous on Sesame Street and The Muppet Show. But the original Kermit looked more like a lizard, made with ping-pong ball eyes and green felt from an old coat thrown out by Henson's mother. Museum curator Dwight Blocker Bowers said the muppets would be a boon for the museum's collection. \"It certainly shows the muppets at the beginning of the career of a large family of entertainers,\" he said. \"More than anything, I think it shows the genius of Jim Henson.\" Bowers said the museum plans to have the original muppets on display by November in the pop culture gallery.

The last three series have been praised for showing an insight into what education is like in Britain. But there's also been criticism they focussed too much on bullying, bad language and teen pregnancies. As someone who was once a teacher (all be it a substitute) I can tell you there is just as much bad language in a staff room as there is in the common room. But try not offending someone in 2014. With that in mind the producers have planned a fourth series and to tick another regional box they've decided to head to Wales for the first time.

    "HWT": "Where can you have a day out for less than £25? The BBC's Price of Football study has analysed data from 223 clubs across Britain and Europe to find out how much is costs supporters to follow their team. Overall, 36% of ticket prices in the division went up compared to last year's study - the biggest percentage increase across the men's leagues in the UK. The average cost of the cheapest matchday ticket has gone up to £22.11 - a six-year high - while the most expensive matchday tickets average £36.13. The average season ticket prices are at their lowest since 2013 - with the cheapest averaging £322.83 and the most expensive averaging £568.15. A £30 away ticket cap was introduced in the Premier League at the start of the season, in the same year that a record £8bn TV rights deal came into effect. With no cap in the Championship, the average price of the most expensive away ticket is £31.57 - more than £2 dearer than the top flight. However, the average in the cheapest away ticket category has fallen by 9% to £20.98 since last year. Twelve Championship clubs offer away tickets for more than £30: Aston Villa, Barnsley, Brentford, Brighton, Derby, Ipswich, Leeds, Newcastle Norwich, Nottingham Forest, QPR and Sheffield Wednesday.",
    "MGT": "As football fans across England gear up for another thrilling Championship season, ticket prices once again become a hot topic of discussion. Interestingly, not all away games offer the financial relief fans might expect when clubs move from the Premier League’s exorbitant pricing to the Championship. In fact, some Championship clubs have been found to charge higher prices for away tickets than certain Premier League teams.\n\nThe disparity in ticket pricing between the two divisions can be attributed to various factors, including stadium capacities, club ambitions, and operational costs. Clubs like Brentford, Reading, and Nottingham Forest have been noted for their higher-than-average away ticket prices in recent seasons.

    "MGT_raw": "As football fans across England gear up for another thrilling Championship season, ticket prices once again become a hot topic of discussion. Interestingly, not all away games offer the financial relief fans might expect when clubs move from the Premier League’s exorbitant pricing to the Championship. In fact, some Championship clubs have been found to charge higher prices for away tickets than certain Premier League teams.\n\nThe disparity in ticket pricing between the two divisions can be attributed to various factors, including stadium capacities, club ambitions, and operational costs. Clubs like Brentford, Reading, and Nottingham Forest have been noted for their higher-than-average away ticket prices in recent seasons.

    "prompt": "Four people in Brazil have been charged with manslaughter in connection with the deaths of 241 people in The Kiss nightclub fire in January.",
    "HWT": "Two nightclub owners and two members of the band playing as the fire began are accused of \"negligent homicide\". A police inquiry in the city of Santa Maria found that the fire was triggered by fireworks used by the band. Most of the victims died after inhaling the toxic smoke produced when ceiling insulation foam caught fire. Investigators also criticised the fact that the venue only had one exit. The police investigation identified 16 potential accused, of which eight have been charged. Four people were charged earlier for obstructing the course of justice, including two firemen accused of hiding evidence that the club's fire licence had expired. Nightclub owners Mauro Hoffmann and Elissandro Spohr and two members of the Gurizada Fandangueira band, Marcelo de Jesus dos Santos and Luciano Bonilha Leao, face trial for manslaughter. Prosecutor Joel Dutra said the four men knew of the possible impact of their actions and failed to act. \"To die through the inhalation of toxic fumes is a cruel way of dying,\" he said. \"The reason they died was the search for profit, through the use of inadequate fireworks and highly inflammable foam on the nightclub's ceiling.\" The police report published in March said dozens of eyewitnesses reported seeing the singer on stage holding the firework which triggered the blaze. Attempts by the singer and a security guard to extinguish the fire failed when the extinguisher they used did not work, the witnesses said. Many said that the security guards at the club at first tried to stop people from leaving the club, which was found to be overcrowded. The fire, and the lack of safety precautions at the venue, have prompted widespread concern about Brazil's ability to host major sporting events in the next four years. The 2014 World Cup is set to be played in 12 Brazilian cities, while the 2016 Olympics are to take place in Rio de Janeiro.",

As panic ensued, the club's narrow exits became bottlenecks for the thousands of patrons inside, leading to a devastating loss of life. The rapid spread of the fire, fueled by flammable soundproofing foam, created a smoky inferno that left little room for escape.\n\nThe charges brought against the four individuals include negligence and failure to adhere to safety regulations, which prosecutors argue directly contributed to the catastrophic event. The accused include the club's owner, Cleber Machado, two security guards, and one band member. According to authorities, the club lacked adequate emergency exits, and many of the exits were either blocked or non-functional, severely hampering evacuation efforts.\n\nThe investigation revealed that the nightclub had been operating without the necessary permits and had repeatedly violated local safety codes. The foam used in the club's construction and decoration, which proved to be highly flammable, was a key factor in the rapid spread of the fire.

    "HWT": "Over the past four weeks, 26 people have been admitted to intensive care as a result of the flu, compared to five people over the same period last year. Most of the patients have underlying health conditions. The Scottish government said almost half of those eligible for vaccinations due to such conditions are yet to receive them. People who suffer from chronic conditions such as asthma, heart problems, diabetes, kidney or liver disease are at risk of serious complications from flu, and are offered the vaccination by the NHS. However, 48% of those with pre-existing health conditions eligible for the jab have not received it. Meanwhile 54% of pregnant mothers have not had the free vaccine. Public health minister Maureen Watt said: \"It is important that those who are eligible for the flu vaccination make an appointment as soon as possible to protect their health. \"Flu is a serious illness and each year the winter months present an increase in the number of cases requiring hospital treatment. \"Flu can cause severe health complications, and the best way to protect yourself and help prevent spread of the virus is to get vaccinated.\" Appealing to those who have not yet had the jab, she added: \"It only takes a few minutes, and even if you were immunised against flu last winter it is important to receive the vaccine again, as the viruses change each season.\"",
    "MGT": "In recent weeks, health officials in Scotland have observed a concerning increase in the number of flu patients requiring serious medical attention. In response, public health authorities are urging residents across the country to prioritize getting vaccinated as soon as possible.

The vaccine is available at various locations, including GP surgeries, pharmacies, and some workplaces, and health officials are encouraging everyone eligible to take advantage of this opportunity.\n\nDr. Fiona McRoberts, a spokesperson for the Scottish Health Protection Agency, emphasized the importance of vaccination in preventing severe illness and potential hospitalization. “The flu vaccine is our best defense against what can be a very serious illness. We’ve seen a spike in cases this season, and it’s vital that we all do our part to prevent further spread,” she stated.\n\nThe health authorities are also reminding the public that flu symptoms can include fever, chills, muscle aches, cough, congestion, runny nose, headaches, and fatigue. With the flu virus capable of leading to severe complications, including pneumonia, hospitalization, and even death, getting vaccinated remains a top priority.\n\nEfforts are also being made to increase awareness about the benefits of the flu vaccine through various campaigns. The public is encouraged to stay informed about the locations and times they can receive their vaccination, ensuring that the flu does not become a larger public health crisis.

    "HWT": "Mr Amadou was arrested in November 2015 for baby-trafficking charges after fleeing to France for a year. He filed for provisional release to run in the elections but Judge Ibrahim Harouna denied the appeal on Monday. Mr Amadou says the accusations against him are politically motivated. The Constitutional Court on Saturday approved him to stand in elections. The court of appeals did not give a reason for the verdict. Mr Amadou's second wife was arrested in June 2014 along with 16 others, accused of illegally buying new-borns from \"baby factories\" in south-east Nigeria - where babies are allegedly sold for thousands of dollars. All denied any wrongdoing. Mr Amadou - a leading opposition presidential candidate - was then arrested in November 2015 after living in exile in France. Mr Amadou's supporters say the charges were fabricated to prevent him from running against President Mahamadou Issouffou in the 21 February presidential election. \"With this rejection of conditional release, the regime succeeded with its first knock-out blow,\" his lawyer, Souley Oumara, said. The BBC's Abdourahmane Dia says that Mr Amadou now has five days to appeal against the decision - or risk following the election from his prison cell. Tensions have been rising in Niger ahead of the elections. On Monday, lawyers in the country staged a 24-hour strike to oppose what they call the arbitrary arrest of government opponents. In December, President Mahamadou Issoufou said his government had foiled a plot to overthrow him.

The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) report, issued every two years, says that a baby born between 2011 and 2013 can expect to live to 80.1 years if it is a boy and 84.3 if it is a girl. The national snapshot said 15% of the current population was aged 65 and over and by 2054 this was projected to increase to 21%, or 8.4 million people. About 3% of the population is Indigenous, it added. The report showed most children were doing well and most young people were studying or working, said Acting AIHW Director Kerry Flanagan. \"Adult participation in the labour force is higher than 20 years ago, and while some people are staying at work longer, after retirement, the majority of older Australians are not using aged care services,\" said Ms Flanagan. \"On the other hand, we see that 1 in 37 children are receiving child protection services, around 2 million Australians, mostly women, have experienced partner violence since the age of 15, youth unemployment exceeds 13%, and there's been little improvement in the proportion of young people who are not fully engaged in employment, education or training.\" About 28% of the population was born overseas, with the largest number coming from the UK, followed by New Zealand and China. That compares with 24% 10 years ago.",

This encouraging trend underscores the nation's advancements in healthcare and overall well-being.\n\nAccording to the latest findings, Australians can now expect to live longer, healthier lives compared to previous generations. The report highlights that the average life expectancy in Australia is among the highest in the world, reflecting the success of the country's health systems and policies. Moreover, the increase in disability-free years is a testament to the effectiveness of preventive healthcare measures and early intervention strategies.\n\nThe report attributes this positive development to several factors, including improved medical treatments, enhanced access to healthcare services, and a greater emphasis on public health initiatives. Lifestyle changes, such as healthier diets, increased physical activity, and reduced smoking rates, have also played a crucial role in enhancing the quality of life for Australians.\n\nHealth experts emphasize that while increased life expectancy is a positive outcome, it is equally important to focus on the quality of those additional years. The fact that Australians are spending a larger proportion of their lives without disability is a significant achievement. This trend suggests that people are not only living longer but also enjoying a better quality of life in their later years.\n\nThe report also points out the role of government policies in supporting these outcomes. Investments in healthcare infrastructure, research, and community health programs have been instrumental in achieving these results. Additionally, public health campaigns aimed at reducing risk factors for chronic diseases have contributed to the overall improvement in health outcomes.\n\nHowever, the report also notes that challenges remain, particularly in addressing health disparities among different population groups. Efforts are needed to ensure that all Australians, regardless of their background or socioeconomic status, can benefit from these advancements in health and longevity.\n\nIn conclusion, the new report offers a promising outlook for the future of health in Australia.

    "prompt": "The Dutch government has announced that it will ban the use of the mild narcotic khat.",
    "HWT": "It is a leaf-based drug that, when chewed, releases juices that act as natural stimulants and is popular with the Somali community. The Netherlands is used as a hub to transport khat imported from the Horn of Africa to other European countries. There are concerns that the drug can cause psychosis or bring on schizophrenia. The BBC's Anna Holligan in the Netherlands says the country has a traditionally liberal approach to soft drugs. However, a Dutch government report cited noise, litter and the perceived public threat posed by men who chew khat as some of the reasons for outlawing the drug. \"I'm involved in the ban because it appears to cause serious problems, particularly in the Somali community,\" Dutch immigration minister Gerd Leers is quoted as saying by Radio Netherlands. Source: www.talktofrank.com He said that 10% of Somali men in the Netherlands were badly affected by the drug. \"They are lethargic and refuse to co-operate with the government or take responsibility for themselves or their families,\" he said. Very few Dutch nationals use the drug, which is mainly chewed by people from Somalia, Ethiopia, Kenya and Yemen. Our reporter says more than 25,000 Somalis now live in the Netherlands and as the population arrived, the use of khat in the country grew. At the moment it is legally imported via Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport four times a week. Khat leaves need to be fresh, otherwise they lose their potency. Last year, khat worth around $18m (£11.6m) was brought into the Netherlands. The use of the stimulant is banned in the US, Canada and several other European countries. But it is still available in the UK where it is legally sold in a small number of grocery stores.",
    "MGT": "The Dutch government has announced plans to ban the use of khat, a mild narcotic plant, citing health concerns and social issues associated with its consumption. Khat has been traditionally chewed for its stimulant effects, which are due to the presence of cathinone, a substance similar to amphetamines. The decision, expected to take effect within the next few months, marks a significant shift in the Netherlands' drug policy, which has traditionally been more permissive.\n\nThe government’s announcement comes after extensive studies and consultations with health experts, law enforcement agencies, and local communities. Authorities have expressed concerns over potential health risks, including mental health issues and dependency, linked to khat consumption. The plant is known to cause euphoria, increased alertness, and a sense of well-being, but these effects can lead to long-term psychological problems and a decrease in cognitive function.\n\nAdditionally, the social implications of khat use have been a growing concern. The plant, imported primarily from East Africa and the Middle East, has been associated with social isolation and a decline in community integration among users. The Dutch government has also noted the substance's potential to exacerbate social tensions and contribute to domestic violence in some communities.\n\nThe ban follows a period of increased scrutiny and public debate over the legal status of khat. Despite being legal in the Netherlands, the plant has often been sold in ethnic markets and has been a subject of controversy. The decision to ban it aligns with broader European Union efforts to regulate substances that pose health and social risks, as several other EU countries have already banned khat.\n\nIn response to the announcement, various community leaders and advocacy groups have expressed mixed reactions. Some have welcomed the decision, highlighting the need for public health interventions and support for those affected by khat dependency. Others, however, have raised concerns about the cultural implications of the ban, particularly for immigrant communities for whom khat chewing is a traditional practice.\n\nThe Dutch government has outlined measures to support affected individuals, including public health campaigns and resources for addiction treatment. Law enforcement agencies will also receive guidance on enforcement strategies to ensure a smooth transition to the new legal framework.\n\nAs the ban approaches implementation, the Dutch government emphasizes the importance of addressing both the health and social dimensions of khat use, aiming to foster a safer and more integrated society.

    "HWT": "The announcement comes after an earlier round of layoffs in May and the resignation of the firm's chief executive. Etsy, which became a public company in 2015, has struggled to turn a profit. Competition has also mounted from other firms, including Amazon, which has launched its own handicraft market. The two rounds of layoffs total about 230, or roughly 22% of the firm's workforce at the end of 2016. Most of the cuts announced on Wednesday will come at the firm's Brooklyn headquarters, in positions such as marketing, product management and administration. Founded in 2005, Etsy employed about 1,000 people globally at the end of 2016 and had about 1.7 million active sellers. The company made $365m in revenue in 2016, but it has posted a loss every year since at least 2012, according to its annual report. At least one of its shareholders has pressured the firm to consider selling itself. Two private equity firms - TPG Group and Dragoneer Investment Group - said last month they had taken a large stake in the company.

One student said: \"I really did think it was someone who was going to jump off a building.\" Gormley is one the UK's leading artists and is probably best known for his Angel of the North. In defending the UEA installation, he said: \"These works are nothing to do with suicide, they're actually to do with life and they're placed on the skyline in a way to make us think about space and distance. \"Universities are places where people spend a lot of time thinking about the thoughts of others, \"I think it's a wonderful place to balance that intellectual life with an object that is silent, it doesn't need to be read.

    "HWT": "Enterprise Minister Jonathan Bell visited company executives in the French capital and said: \"I have every belief in its success.\" The CSeries will enter service with airlines three years behind schedule next year. It is presently short of a 300-order target. Currently, firm orders are 243 and there has not been one since last September. It is also $2bn (£1.29bn) over budget. However, the Canadian aerospace company sees the CSeries Paris debut as a pivotal moment. \"There's always a lot of pressure to come up with big orders,\" president of commercial aircraft Fred Cromer told the BBC. \"But right now it's like the old-fashioned days - we are here to show off the equipment.\" The company's Belfast division makes the CSeries wings at a £520m factory in Queens Island. Full production of the two different sized versions of the aircraft would support 800 jobs in a workforce of 5,700. Invest NI chief executive Alastair Hamilton, who also attended the Paris launch, said:  \"I believe they will kick on from today. There are many years ahead for this aircraft.\" Bombardier's familiar territory is executive jets and this is a major step up into larger passenger planes seating between 100 to 160 passengers. Its competitors are the big two firms Boeing and Airbus. Aviation analyst Mark Pilling of Flightglobal said \"They're two great big gorillas. \"Bombardier need to execute on this aircraft and get orders.\" The technical data announced in Paris revealed improved results on fuel economy, the main selling point of the CSeries. The larger CS300 will fly to Belfast on Friday for what is seen as a morale-boosting visit for workers.",
    "MGT": "Bombardier has reaffirmed its confidence in the CSeries aircraft, predicting the jet will secure new orders as it presents newly released technical performance data at the Paris Air Show. The aerospace company is leveraging this prestigious platform to showcase the improvements and capabilities of its CSeries, aiming to attract airlines seeking efficient and reliable aircraft.\n\nThe CSeries has been a focal point for Bombardier as it seeks to capture a significant share of the single-aisle market. With its latest enhancements, the aircraft is positioned as a strong competitor, boasting fuel-efficient technology, advanced aerodynamics, and state-of-the-art avionics. These features are designed to meet the evolving needs of airlines, providing both operational cost savings and an enhanced passenger experience.\n\nBombardier's chief executive highlighted that the CSeries is a game-changer in the narrow-body segment, emphasizing its role in transforming air travel economics. The aircraft's advanced technology is expected to offer a 20% reduction in fuel burn compared to existing models, a critical factor for airlines striving to reduce operational costs amid fluctuating fuel prices.\n\nAt the Paris Air Show, Bombardier is showcasing not only the CSeries' technical prowess but also its commitment to sustainability. The company is actively engaging with potential customers, demonstrating how the CSeries can help airlines achieve their environmental goals through reduced emissions.\n\nIndustry analysts have noted that Bombardier's strategy at the air show is well-timed, as several airlines are in the market for new aircraft to replace aging fleets. The company is optimistic that the CSeries will be a top choice for these carriers, given its competitive advantages.\n\nIn addition to technical demonstrations, Bombardier is also hosting discussions and presentations with industry experts to further highlight the CSeries' benefits.

    "HWT": "The figure-hugging Jean Louis gown, with 2,500 crystals, was bought by the Ripley's Believe It or Not museum chain, exceeding the $3m guide price. The company's vice president said it was \"most iconic piece of pop culture that there is\". Monroe died from a drug overdose just three months after the performance. The sultry rendition for President Kennedy's 45th birthday at a 1962 Democratic fundraiser at New York's Madison Square was one of her last public appearances. President Kennedy was shot dead a year later. The dress, which the auction house said was so tight she had to be sewn into it, had previously been bought at auction for $1.3m in 1999 by the late business mogul and collector Martin Zweig. The sum raised is likely to set a new world record for the most expensive dress sold at auction. Marilyn Monroe's billowing white dress from the Seven Year Itch sold for $4.6 million (plus $1m in commission) in 2011. The largest collection of the screen star's possessions ever offered for auction is being sold by Julien's auction house in Beverly Hills over three days. Also sold on Thursday was the cocktail dress she wore in \"Some Like it Hot\", which fetched $450,000. Many of the 1,000 lots come from the estate of her acting coach, Lee Strasberg, who became a close friend of the actress. She bequeathed her personal effects and clothing to him in her will.",

Monroe's sultry performance has since been etched into American history, capturing the glamour and intrigue of the era.\n\nThe bidding war for the dress was intense, reflecting its extraordinary significance and rarity.

    "prompt": "The fate of five Picasso murals on buildings damaged in the Anders Breivik bombing in Oslo in 2011 has led to a heated debate in Norway.",
    "HWT": "A panel of experts has recommended demolishing the buildings and removing the murals. But art experts say that as the murals were designed by Picasso for those specific buildings, they should remain where they are. The artworks were Picasso's first attempts at concrete murals. The murals were drawn specifically for the government buildings known as H and Y block. Picasso's designs were sandblasted onto the concrete both outside and inside the buildings by the Norwegian artist Carl Nesjar. Both buildings were damaged when Breivik set off a van bomb at the foot of H block in July 2011. It was the start of a series of attacks that left 77 dead, mostly teenagers on the island of Utoeya. The blast in Oslo killed eight people and badly damaged the H block, along with neighbouring ministries. A panel of experts has decided the most economical solution would be to demolish the buildings, cut the murals out and place them elsewhere. A recent poll by Norwegian newspaper Verdens Gang showed public opinion was divided, with 39.5% supporting demolition, while 34.3% thought the buildings should be kept. Artist Dag Hol was widely quoted as saying it was a \"golden opportunity\" to get rid of \"brutal, ugly and degrading architecture\". But Joern Holme, head of the Directorate for Cultural Heritage, said the buildings were historically important - architecturally, politically and artistically. \"We can't demolish the best (parts) of a cultural era just because we find it ugly today,\" he said. Norway's government has until early next year to decide what to do about the buildings. The rights to the murals are owned by the Picasso family and they must be consulted on what happens to them Claudia Andrieu, a legal expert with the Picasso Administration, said they have not been approached yet but are \"open to dialogue\".",
    "MGT": "In Oslo, a contentious debate has unfolded over the fate of five Picasso murals that adorn the walls of buildings damaged in the 2011 bombing orchestrated by Anders Breivik. The artworks, created in 1949, are integral to Norway's cultural heritage and have sparked a passionate discussion about restoration and preservation.\n\nOn July 22, 2011, Breivik detonated a bomb in the government district of Oslo, causing significant damage and loss of life. Among the affected structures were the Oslo City Hall and the Norwegian Labour Party's youth organization building, both adorned with Picasso's celebrated murals. The destruction left these historic pieces of art in precarious states, raising immediate concerns about their preservation.\n\nThe murals, titled \"The Fishermen\" and \"The Pioneers,\" are celebrated for their vibrant colors and dynamic composition, reflecting Picasso's post-war artistic phase. Their presence in Oslo is a testament to the city's rich cultural history and the enduring legacy of Picasso himself.\n\nIn the aftermath of the attack, the Norwegian government and cultural bodies have grappled with the challenge of restoring the murals to their former glory. Restoration efforts have been met with both support and opposition. Advocates argue that restoring the murals is essential to preserving national heritage and honoring the victims of the tragedy. They emphasize that the murals are not only artistic treasures but also symbols of resilience and unity in the face of adversity.\n\nConversely, some critics question the feasibility and ethics of restoration. They argue that the murals, having been part of a site of such profound tragedy, should be left in their current state as a form of memorial. This faction believes that restoration could inadvertently diminish the historical significance of the site, turning a somber reminder into a spectacle.\n\nThe debate has also delved into technical and financial considerations. The restoration of such large-scale murals is a complex and costly endeavor, requiring specialized expertise and significant funding. The Norwegian government has been evaluating various proposals, weighing the cultural importance against practical constraints.\n\nAs the discussion continues, the Norwegian public remains deeply engaged, reflecting on what these murals represent for the nation's collective memory. Whatever decision is reached, it will undoubtedly shape Norway's approach to cultural preservation in the years to come, balancing respect for history with the imperatives of restoration.

    "HWT": "The Glasgow-based company, which has been restructuring in order to improve efficiency, has forecast a pre-tax profit of between Â£250m and Â£270m. The figures match those given in the summer when it issued a profits warning. It also reported a 7% fall in underlying third-quarter revenue. In a trading statement, Aggreko said sales from its rental solutions division were down 1% on last year. It added that the ongoing weakness in the oil and gas and mining sectors had been largely offset by continued growth in other sectors, such as petrochemical and refining. Aggreko also reported an 11% fall in revenue from its power solutions arm, with the \"continuing weak economic backdrop in Brazil\" having an impact on its business. In August, Aggreko reorganised the group into two units following a business review. It also announced plans to add more engineering resources to its Dumbarton manufacturing facility as part of a consolidation process. Chief executive Chris Weston said Aggreko continued \"to demonstrate its resilience against a challenging market backdrop\". He added: \"Whilst we are at an early stage in delivering the specific actions identified at our business review in August, I am encouraged with the progress we are making which, regardless of the prevailing market conditions, will strengthen Aggreko and position it well for the future.\" By lunchtime on Monday, Aggreko's shares were up by more than 7%.",
    "MGT": "Aggreko, the leading temporary power provider, has confidently maintained its full-year profit guidance despite experiencing a dip in sales during the third quarter. The company, known for its role in delivering reliable power solutions across various industries, reported a drop in revenue, which many anticipated might impact its financial outlook. However, Aggreko's management remains optimistic about achieving its projected targets for the year.\n\nIn the third quarter, Aggreko saw a decline in sales, attributed to a combination of factors including lower project starts in certain regions and a slowdown in some key sectors that traditionally drive demand for their services. Despite these challenges, the company has emphasized its strong operational performance and strategic initiatives aimed at bolstering future growth.\n\nAggreko's commitment to its profit guidance is supported by a robust order book, which continues to show positive momentum. The company has secured significant contracts in various sectors, including energy, infrastructure, and events, underscoring its ability to diversify and adapt to changing market conditions. This diversified portfolio not only cushions against regional sales fluctuations but also positions Aggreko to capitalize on emerging opportunities.\n\nMoreover, Aggreko's focus on innovation and sustainability is expected to drive long-term growth. The company is investing in renewable energy solutions and expanding its capabilities to meet the increasing demand for cleaner and more efficient power solutions. These strategic moves align with global trends towards sustainability and are likely to enhance Aggreko's competitive edge.\n\nIn conclusion, despite the third-quarter sales drop, Aggreko's strong order book, diversified business model, and strategic investments in innovation and sustainability provide a solid foundation for achieving its full-year profit targets.

Reilly had been driving his car around Exmouth town centre for 10 minutes which Judge Graham Cottle of Exeter Crown Court said made clear he'd \"obviously been following her\". The judge said: \"Eventually you tried to grab her. You grabbed her between the legs, pulling her into your car. I am not sure exactly how long she remained kidnapped but it was a few minutes before she was able to affect her release.\" Reilly had spent the afternoon looking at sex and prostitution websites before he went out in his car in the early hours of the morning. Prosecutor Peter Coombe said the evidence of Mr Reilly's internet use in the hours before the incident suggested he may have been planning an attack or abduction. Reilly was also placed on the sex offenders register for 10 years.",
    "MGT": "In a sobering verdict, a football coach has been sentenced to 18 months in prison after abducting and sexually assaulting a teenager. The case drew significant public attention due to the breach of trust involved and the young age of the victim.\n\nThe 45-year-old coach, who had been a well-respected figure in the local community, was found guilty of both abduction and sexual assault following a court trial. The victim, a 16-year-old aspiring athlete, was lured away from a team training session under the pretext of discussing sports opportunities.\n\nThe court heard how the coach initially befriended the teenager, exploiting his position of authority to gain the young athlete's trust. This trust was then tragically violated when he abducted the teenager from a public area and subjected him to sexual assault.\n\nDuring the trial, the defense argued for leniency, citing the coach's previously unblemished record and contributions to youth sports. However, the prosecution emphasized the severity of the crime and its impact on the victim, highlighting the breach of trust and the psychological trauma inflicted.\n\nThe victim bravely testified, recounting the traumatic experience and its lasting effects on his mental health. His courage was praised by both legal representatives and community members who have rallied to support him throughout the proceedings.\n\nIn handing down the sentence, the judge condemned the coach's actions, stating they represented a grave breach of the responsibilities placed upon those who work with young people. The judge also acknowledged the need for justice to be served, not only for the victim but to serve as a deterrent to others in positions of authority.\n\nThe community, while relieved at the verdict, remains shaken by the events. Local sports clubs have vowed to implement stricter safeguarding measures to prevent such incidents from occurring in the future. The victim's family expressed gratitude for the public support and hope that this case will raise awareness about the importance of child protection in sports.",

    "HWT": "Steenson, 31, was capped at youth level by Ireland, but has spent most of his career in England and has been a key member of the Exeter team. \"There aren't that many good 10's in Ireland,\" said Whitten, who has two caps for Ireland. \"I have to say that Gareth Steenson's been very, very unlucky not to have been capped by Ireland.\" Steenson moved to Exeter from Cornish Pirates in 2008 and kicked the winning penalty that saw the Chiefs beat Bristol in the inaugural Championship play-off final in 2010, leading to their promotion to the top flight for the first time. Since then he has become Exeter's record Premiership points-scorer, with 953, and equalled the top flight record of nine penalties in a match in 2014. \"I was lucky enough to get capped before I came over here,\" added Whitten, who agreed a new contract at Sandy Park last week. \"But similar to the English, although they don't openly say it, they don't like to pick guys playing outside of Ireland. \"That's fair enough, I accept that stance, and I enjoy playing here. I don't consider going back home as I didn't want to leave (the club).\"",
    "MGT": "Exeter Chiefs fly-half Gareth Steenson is a strong candidate for inclusion in the Ireland squad, according to his team-mate Ian Whitten. With his impressive performances in the Premiership, Steenson has drawn attention for his potential to enhance the Irish backline. Whitten, who recently returned to the Chiefs, has been vocal in advocating for his teammate, highlighting Steenson's form and leadership qualities.\n\nSteenson, who has represented Ireland at various levels, has consistently demonstrated his ability to control a match with his strategic kicking and decision-making skills. His performances this season have been pivotal for Exeter, contributing significantly to their recent successes. Whitten believes that Steenson's experience and composure under pressure make him a valuable asset for the national team, especially as Ireland gears up for the upcoming Six Nations Championship.\n\nThe call for Steenson’s inclusion comes at a time when Ireland's management is under scrutiny to select a squad that can compete at the highest level. With several key players recovering from injuries, there is an opportunity for emerging talents to step up. Whitten has praised Steenson's dedication and work ethic, emphasizing his capability to adapt quickly to international rugby's demands.\n\nSteenson’s versatility and vision on the field are seen as crucial for Ireland’s strategic play. If selected, he would bring a wealth of experience from the domestic league, where he has been a standout performer. As the Six Nations approaches, the Irish rugby community eagerly anticipates the final squad announcement, with many hoping to see Steenson in the lineup.",

    "HWT": "Interior Ministry spokesman Sediq Sediqqi tweeted that 64 \"innocent Afghans\" were killed and 347 wounded. A suicide attacker detonated a vehicle and a fierce gun battle followed in one of the deadliest attacks in Kabul for years. A Taliban spokesman said the group carried out the attack. It came a week after it said it was launching its \"spring offensive\", warning of large-scale attacks, although the group fights all year round. Why are the Taliban resurgent in Afghanistan? Tuesday's bombing happened during the morning rush hour in Pul-e-Mahmud, a busy neighbourhood where homes, mosques, schools and businesses nestle close to the ministry of defence, other ministries and military compounds. The blast shattered windows up to 1.6km (one mile) away. A police officer told the Associated Press it was one of the most powerful explosions he had ever heard, and he could not see or hear anything for 20 minutes after. It appears the initial blast cleared the way for Taliban fighters to enter the area - a commonly used tactic. It had previously been reported that at least 28 people had been killed and 329 injured. Mr Sediqqi told reporters that most of the 64 now reported dead were civilians. He said most of the wounded were in a stable condition. At least 71 Shia worshippers were killed in 2011 in a rare attack on a Shia shrine in Kabul. Afghan security forces regularly foil similar attacks, correspondents say, but with explosives easily available and bomb-making skills common, it is difficult to prevent all of them.",

Emergency services were swiftly mobilized, working tirelessly amidst the chaos to rescue victims trapped under debris and provide urgent medical care to the injured. Hospitals across the city were overwhelmed as they received a surge of patients, with many doctors and medical staff working around the clock to tend to the wounded.\n\nThe Afghan government has initiated a thorough investigation to determine the cause of the explosion and to identify those responsible. Preliminary reports suggest the possibility of a suicide attack, although authorities have yet to confirm any specific findings.

Sean Newton's long seventh-minute throw-in was headed on by Vadaine Oliver for Parkin to volley home at the far post, and the striker then finished off a similar move with another close-range finish six minutes later. York keeper Kyle Letheren had a moment to forget when he failed to deal with Ross Stearn's simple in-swinging free-kick and allowed the ball to bounce between his legs into the back of the net.

Substitute Tyler Garratt then hit the post at the other end with a bouncing 25-yard drive. Oliver nearly restored York's two-goal lead when his header from an Asa Hall corner was pushed against the bar by keeper Ryan Clarke.

    "prompt": "India's national carrier Air India is set to ground 125 \"overweight\" cabin crew members.",
    "HWT": "An Air India official told the BBC that the order had been made on the basis of a document issued by the civil aviation authority last year. The airline had warned 600 of its crew to \"shape up\" last year, but 125 had not managed to maintain the required weight, the official said. The airline says however that the issue is not one of weight, but \"fitness\". Airline officials confirmed to the BBC that the directive had been issued, but said it was part of an internal document which they could not comment on publicly. They said the basis for the recommendation was concern that \"unfit\" cabin crew would not be able to operate efficiently in emergency situations. Aviation regulations state that a Body Mass Index (BMI) of 18-25 is normal for a male cabin crew member, while for a female it is 18-22. Aviation expert Kapil Kaul told the BBC: \"An overweight crew is a signal the airline is not fit. You need a smart friendly agile crew that can complement the image of the airline.\" However, national union leader Tapan Sen denied that service rules mention any firm weight restriction for cabin crew. This is not the first time Air India has grounded staff over weight issues. In 2009, it dismissed nine hostesses for being \"overweight\" on safety grounds saying their shape could \"impair agility\". In 2004, the airline landed itself in further controversy when it said that potential air hostesses and stewards should not have any scars, acne, or any major marks on the face.",
    "MGT": "India's national carrier, Air India, has announced plans to ground approximately 125 cabin crew members who have been classified as \"overweight.\" This decision comes as part of the airline's revamped health and fitness policy aimed at ensuring the safety and well-being of both passengers and crew members.\n\nThe move follows an internal audit conducted by the airline, which assessed the health parameters of its crew. The audit revealed that these 125 members did not meet the new fitness standards established by Air India. The airline emphasized that this decision was taken with a focus on passenger safety, as overweight staff could potentially face difficulties during emergency evacuations, thereby posing risks during critical situations.\n\nAir India's management stated that the policy is not discriminatory but rather a necessary measure to align with international aviation safety standards. They highlighted that maintaining a healthy weight is crucial for the demanding physical requirements of cabin crew duties, which include assisting passengers during emergencies, ensuring compliance with health and safety protocols, and providing effective customer service.\n\nThe affected crew members were given a notice period during which they were expected to meet the new fitness criteria. The airline has also introduced wellness programs, including diet plans and fitness training, to assist their staff in meeting these standards. Additionally, Air India is offering counseling and support to those impacted, emphasizing that the policy is designed to be supportive rather than punitive.\n\nThis initiative is part of a broader strategy by Air India to enhance its operational efficiency and service quality. By prioritizing health and fitness, the airline aims to foster a more secure and comfortable flying environment for its passengers. The decision has sparked discussions within the aviation community about the balance between stringent health policies and the rights of employees, but Air India maintains that the move is essential for maintaining the highest standards of safety and service.",

The Maritime and Coastguard Agency got calls from people in the Highlands, Dumfries and Galloway and Cumbria concerned it was a distress flare. Mr Macdonald described his images as a \"fluke\". Mr Macdonald said: \"I was taking some new pictures to put on my Facebook page using a Sony RX100 compact camera. \"It was a beautiful, clear night and I got some nice pictures but capturing the meteor was a fluke. I will never take a picture like that again.\" Mr Macdonald, who runs the business The Hebridean Explorer, said he had seen messages on social media of a meteor being seen elsewhere, including Sleat on Skye. Meteor sightings were also said to have been made from North Uist, Oban and Mull. A \"meteorite\" mistaken for a distress flare also sparked a lifeboat search operation off the English coast on Sunday.

Many initially believed the meteor to be a distress signal, leading to an influx of calls to emergency services. The Coastguard in both Scotland and England reported an unusual spike in activity, with several callers expressing concern over the unusual light.\n\nAstronomers have since confirmed that the meteor was likely part of a larger meteor shower, possibly related to the debris trails of Comet Swift-Tuttle, known for the Perseid meteor showers. The meteor was visible over a wide area, with reports coming from as far south as the English coast.\n\nLocal photographer, Emily McAllister, captured the moment from her vantage point at Loch Ness. \"It was an incredible sight,\" she said. \"The sky lit up with a brilliant flash, and I knew I had to capture it. It felt almost magical, especially here by the loch.\"\n\nAuthorities have reassured the public that there was no cause for alarm, and the meteor posed no danger.

    "HWT": "Scientists gave mice drinking water laced with three amino acids. They said the rodents lived significantly longer than other mice fed a normal diet. The research, reported in a scientific journal, has yet to be tried in people. The study leader said a large patient trial was needed to provide evidence to convince doctors. In experiments, middle-aged healthy male mice were given drinking water containing the amino acids leucine, isoleucine and valine. Dr Enzo Nisoli, of the University of Milan, and colleagues, said it increased the average lifespan of the mice by 12% and boosted their fitness and co-ordination. They wrote in their paper, published in Cell Metabolism: \"Our study offers a rationale for deeply exploring the role of amino acids in prevention and control of age-related disorders in humans.\" The amino acids - three of the 20 that make up proteins - have been shown to extend life span in yeast. However, the precise role of these amino acids in humans is unknown. They are used by bodybuilders to maintain muscle tissue and can be bought in health food stores and online.",

    "HWT": "Hawkins won a draining final-frame thriller 13-12 over the pre-tournament favourite late on Monday night. But the Englishman was way below his best from the start against the world number 14 on Tuesday. He scored only 31 points as he lost the first five frames. Hawkins got on the board in frame six, but Fu easily won the last two frames to earn a six-frame advantage after the first session. The quarter-final tie is the best of 25 frames and the second session gets under way on Wednesday at 14:30 BST. Fu played with fluency and impressive cue ball control to take full advantage of some sloppy play by 2013 runner-up Hawkins - the only man to have made the semi-finals, when the Crucible switches to one table - in each of the last three years. But his chances of repeating that feat appear slim after being completely outplayed by London-based Fu, who recorded three half-centuries on his way to a 5-0 lead. World number 11 Hawkins took a scrappy sixth frame, but two half-centuries gave Fu frame seven and he rounded off the session with his sixth score of more than 50. The other afternoon match saw four-time champion John Higgins win four frames in a row to take a 5-3 lead in his all-Scottish meeting with Alan McManus. McManus, twice a World Championship quarter-finalist in the early 1990s, lost the opener but was then in imperious form as he secured a 3-1 mid-session interval lead with breaks of 114, 78 and 56. But the 45-year-old was out of sorts after the interval, appearing to be troubled by a neck problem. And Higgins, who has gone on to lift the title on the last three occasions he has reached the last eight at the Crucible, made the most of some decent chances to take control.

    "HWT": "Police were trying to clear the blockade, which has cut supply lines of fuel and other goods, when protesters attacked a police post at Birgunj. Reports say the man was shot in the head and later died in hospital. The demonstrators, mainly from southern lowland minority groups, are angry about Nepal's new constitution. Communities from the lowlands believe that Nepal's proposed new provinces will lead to their political marginalisation. These concerns have led to violent clashes around Nepal since August, leaving dozens dead. The protester killed on Monday was identified as Ashish Kumar Ram, from Raxaul in the Indian state of Bihar, local officials said. Local police chief Rajubabu Shrestha told the BBC the protesters had entered Nepali territory from India, throwing stones. He said seven protesters and nine police had been injured. Nepal's Home Ministry Spokesman Laxmi Dhakal said two Indian nationals were arrested after they tried to obstruct police who were removing tents at the border. India said it was \"deeply concerned\" by events. \"Issues facing Nepal are political in nature and cannot be resolved by force. \"Causes underlying the present state of confrontation need to addressed by the government of Nepal credibly and effectively,\" the Indian foreign ministry said in a statement. Earlier, there were conflicting reports about the police crackdown. One report said police baton-charged demonstrators forcing them to remove the blockade, while another said authorities removed the tents of sleeping protesters and lined up trucks to pass through the crossing. Police official Hobindra Bogati told the Associated Press news agency that more than 200 trucks and other vehicles had crossed from Birgunj in Nepal to Raxaul and more were lining up.

The clashes underscore ongoing instability in the region, despite previous efforts by the government and allied forces to regain control.\n\nThe confrontations took place in the volatile city of Ramadi, which has seen repeated cycles of conflict between government forces and various militant factions. The violence erupted when militants launched a coordinated attack on military positions, attempting to seize strategic locations within the city.\n\nGovernment forces, alongside pro-government militia units, engaged the militants in fierce combat throughout the day. Despite the heavy casualties, officials reported that the troops managed to repel the attacks and maintain control over key areas. The clashes resulted in significant damage to infrastructure and civilian properties, exacerbating the humanitarian situation in the already war-torn area.\n\nIraqi officials have condemned the attacks, stating that they represent a deliberate attempt by militants to undermine the peace and stability the country has been striving to achieve. The government has vowed to intensify its military operations to root out insurgent elements and restore security across Anbar province.\n\nThis recent outbreak of violence in Anbar is a stark reminder of the challenges Iraq continues to face in its fight against insurgency. Despite substantial gains against extremist groups in recent years, sporadic attacks like these threaten to destabilize the region further and complicate ongoing reconstruction efforts. The international community has expressed concern over the developments, urging continued support for Iraq's security forces in their efforts to maintain peace and stability in the country."

    "HWT": "A ship dragging its anchor on the seabed in the English Channel cut the three main internet cables to the Channel Islands on Monday. Repair work on the first cable is expected to take a week. Daragh McDermott from government owned JT said broadband speeds are expected to be slower during peak times. A second ship is on the way from France to repair the second cable and JT says the third cable will be repaired after that. Jersey's coastguard said there will be an investigation to see if the ship dropped anchor in a banned area. Owners of the King Arthur, Mediterranea di Navigazione, said they were investigating whether it was their ship that caused the problem. Three cables went one after the other on Monday with the first going at 16:00 GMT and the last by 21:00 GMT as the anchor was dragged across the seabed. Mr McDermott said: \"Thanks to the actions taken since the cables were cut, we have capacity in place to manage demand, although we have obviously lost spare capacity should further issues arise.\"",

    "HWT": "Tooting MP Sadiq Khan defended his opposition to a third runway at Heathrow, saying London's air quality was already breaching EU regulations. He said Gatwick Airport should be expanded, with \"high speed links\" between the two and a single check-in. But rival David Lammy accused him of \"the same Ed Miliband politics\". \"My view is the way to proceed is no third runway at Heathrow,\" Mr Khan said, calling for \"a better Heathrow, not a bigger one\". But Tottenham MP Mr Lammy questioned the timing of Mr Khan's decision, which came after the emergence of Conservative MP and environmental campaigner Zac Goldsmith as a potential Tory candidate for the 2016 election. \"Zac Goldsmith has announced he's running and suddenly Sadiq is against it,\" he said, accusing Mr Khan of \"playing the same Ed Miliband politics that got us nowhere\". Former culture secretary Tessa Jowell said she was prepared to wait until the final report of the Airports Commission which is looking at the options for expanding London's air capacity before making up her mind. But she warned against the issue becoming \"gridlocked\" in government. \"We can't go on forever putting this decision off because it's just too difficult,\" she said. Journalist Christian Wolmar said climate change should inform the decision, while Harrow West MP Gareth Thomas said new runways should be built at both Heathrow and Gatwick. Hackney North and Stoke Newington MP Diane Abbott also opposed Heathrow expansion. The candidates were also asked about the \"mansion\" tax on homes worth over Â£2m that was proposed by Labour ahead of the general election. Mr Lammy, Ms Jowell, Ms Abbott and Mr Wolmar all criticised the policy, with Ms Jowell saying that while it had been \"well intentioned\" it had been \"emblematically disastrous\" for Labour because it had caused people \"anxiety\" even if they weren't affected.",
    "MGT": "In a heated first hustings debate, candidates vying for Labour’s nomination for London Mayor engaged in a fiery discussion over the contentious issue of airport expansion. The debate, held in central London, brought the city's aviation future to the forefront, with each candidate presenting their vision for managing growth and environmental concerns.\n\nThe debate opened with the frontrunner, Sarah Jones, emphasizing her commitment to sustainable development. Jones argued that while London needs to maintain its status as a global aviation hub, this should not come at the expense of the environment. She proposed investing in green technology and improving existing airport infrastructure rather than expanding capacity. Jones highlighted the necessity of working with environmental groups to ensure that any future developments align with climate goals.\n\nOpposing this stance, candidate David Greenfield argued that airport expansion is critical to boosting the city's economy and maintaining its competitive edge in the global market. Greenfield pointed to the potential for job creation and increased tourism revenue, suggesting that expansion could be achieved through modern, eco-friendly methods. He acknowledged the environmental concerns but stressed the importance of strategic planning to mitigate potential impacts.\n\nMeanwhile, Zoe Edwards took a middle-ground approach, advocating for a comprehensive review of the current airport capacities and their usage. Edwards proposed conducting a detailed feasibility study to assess the real need for expansion, considering factors such as technological advancements in aircraft efficiency and changes in passenger behavior. She emphasized the need for transparent public consultations to gauge residents' opinions and ensure community interests are prioritized.\n\nThe candidates also discussed the importance of cross-party collaboration in addressing the airport expansion issue. Jones stressed the value of working with other political parties and stakeholders to find a balanced solution that considers both economic and environmental priorities. Greenfield echoed the sentiment, highlighting the need for a united approach to navigate the complex challenges associated with aviation growth in a densely populated city.\n\nAs the debate concluded, it was clear that airport expansion remains a divisive issue within the Labour Party, reflecting broader societal debates over growth and sustainability. With the nomination race heating up, voters are keen to see how each candidate will balance the competing demands of economic development and environmental responsibility in their potential mayoral campaign.\n\nThe hustings debate set the stage for further discussions, with each candidate vowing to engage with the public and experts to refine their policies.

United Kingdom Anti-Doping says Phelps' use of nandrolone was detected in June 2015 and he is banned until July 2019. A summary of the tribunal published by Ukad said Phelps claimed he had taken Viagra and a \"test booster\" product to treat erectile dysfunction. He also claimed not to have taken anything \"for performance enhancement in sport\" but to treat symptoms he had suffered after sustaining a testicular injury. A report by Professor David Cowan, Director of the Drug Control Centre at King's College London, confirmed to the tribunal that \"the human body does not naturally produce nandrolone in measurable quantities and that nandrolone is a drug administered via deep intra-muscular injection\". Ukad legal chief Graham Arthur said athletes are \"solely responsible\" for banned substance found in their system. Arthur added: \"This case highlights that all athletes, regardless of level, must be aware, and understand, the risks to their sporting careers if they test positive. \"They must ensure they manage that risk at all times.\" Phelps' ban comes less than a month after Ukad chief executive Nicole Sapstead said a \"societal problem\" could be the cause of steroid drug use in Welsh rugby.

    "prompt": "Ross County manager Jim McIntyre is urging the Staggies to deliver another of their big-game performances against Aberdeen in Saturday's cup tie.",
    "HWT": "County host the Dons in one of three all-Premiership Scottish Cup fifth-round fixtures. \"Our best performances this season have been against the bigger sides,\" McIntyre told BBC Scotland. \"We know we're going to have to have a good performance again in order to get into the next round.\" McIntyre's men beat Aberdeen when they visited Victoria Park in the league in December and also defeated them in Dingwall last season. \"Aberdeen are playing well at the moment,\" said McIntyre of the side sitting second in the Premiership. \"They've got real pace in their team. They're a real threat at set-plays also. \"We know we need to bring the type of performance that we've had against them here in Dingwall over the last year or so. It's going to take something similar again. \"Their front four are very potent and they've got lots of goals in them and generally most of their goals come from that. \"You need to try and nullify that major threat that they have in that front four positions.\" County drew 1-1 with Rangers at Ibrox in last weekend's Premiership match, having led 1-0 at the break. And McIntyre's assistant Billy Dodds told Radio Scotland's Sportsound: \"The Rangers game on Saturday, it's the best first 45 minutes we've played at any big ground, whether it's Aberdeen, Celtic, Rangers. \"We really deserved to probably be a couple in front but it wasn't to be. \"We've been a bit inconsistent in the league this year. We look a right good team sometimes. \"It's not the ideal draw [against Aberdeen] but it's a great game to take part in. It's such a tricky tie, it'd be hard to call. \"I would like to get through the tie at first time of asking. A trip to Pittodrie [in a replay], you would make Aberdeen probably heavy favourites. \"Our best chance is to go and do it first time. We'll be going all out to do that. Scottish Cup has a special feeling about it.\"",

The team has shown they can rise to the occasion, delivering impressive performances against top-tier teams in the league. Now, with Aberdeen on the horizon, McIntyre is urging his players to harness that same energy and focus.\n\nMcIntyre pointed out that the Scottish Cup offers an opportunity for Ross County to achieve something special, especially in a competition that has historically brought unexpected thrills and upsets. \"We've prepared well for this game,\" McIntyre said. \"We know Aberdeen is a strong side with quality players, but we have our own strengths that we need to exploit.\"\n\nThe manager highlighted the importance of maintaining a solid defensive structure while also pressing high to disrupt Aberdeen’s rhythm. McIntyre believes that if Ross County can control the midfield and apply pressure, they will limit the opportunities for Aberdeen's attacking threats.\n\nIn terms of tactics, McIntyre has been focusing on flexibility and adaptability, preparing his team to adjust their game plan as the match unfolds. \"We must be ready to change things if needed,\" he stated. \"Our players need to be sharp and ready to make the right decisions at the right times.\"\n\nFor Ross County, the Scottish Cup not only presents a chance to progress further in the competition but also an opportunity to bolster their confidence and momentum. McIntyre is aware of the psychological boost that a good cup run can provide, especially as the team aims to maintain their league position and finish the season strongly.\n\nThe squad has been working hard in training, with McIntyre emphasizing the importance of physical fitness and mental toughness. He praised his players' commitment and work ethic, noting that their dedication in training sessions is a positive sign for the upcoming match.\n\nAs the Staggies gear up for this crucial cup tie, the support from their fans will be vital. The team will be looking to the stands for that extra push, hoping the energy from the crowd will spur them on to another memorable performance.\n\nIn conclusion, Jim McIntyre is confident that if Ross County can replicate the tenacity and determination they've shown in other big games, they have a real chance to defeat Aberdeen.

    "HWT": "The incident happened near Byfield 2,000ft (610m) over the skies of Northamptonshire, in May. The pilot of the Van's RV-6 two-seater, single engine craft had to take evasive action, and the drone passed down the left-hand side of the aircraft. He reported the near-miss, but the drone could not be seen on radar and the operator could not be traced. The UK Airprox Board, set up to enhance air safety in the UK, branded the risk rating a \"category B\", meaning the aircraft's security was compromised. The pilot described the drone as a \"red and yellow, three-rotor drone\", which was the \"type that can be easily bought in shops and not a commercial surveillance type vehicle\". The report states the drone operator should not have been operating the drone at such a high altitude. It says: \"Because the drone was being operated at an altitude it should not have been, the reported drone was flown into conflict with the RV6. \"Although there was no radar data to measure the exact separation, the Board thought it was clear from the pilot's report that this was a fairly close encounter, and they assessed the risk as Category B.\"",
    "MGT": "In a startling incident reported by aviation safety investigators, the safety of a light aircraft was compromised following a near-miss with a commercial drone. The event, which occurred over a densely populated urban area, has sparked renewed debates about the regulation of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and their coexistence with manned aircraft.\n\nThe incident took place when a small, privately-owned light aircraft was conducting a routine flight path. According to preliminary reports, the aircraft narrowly avoided a collision with a commercial drone that was reportedly operating within restricted airspace. The light aircraft pilot managed to execute an emergency maneuver just in time, averting what could have been a catastrophic event.\n\nInvestigations into the incident have highlighted significant gaps in current drone regulation and airspace management. The drone, operated by a commercial entity, was found to be flying without the necessary permissions and clearances, raising concerns over the enforcement of existing laws designed to prevent such occurrences.\n\nAviation authorities have responded by urging stricter compliance with airspace regulations and the implementation of more robust monitoring systems to track drone activities. They emphasized the critical need for both commercial and recreational drone operators to adhere to safety protocols to prevent interference with manned aircraft operations.\n\nThe incident has prompted calls for immediate action to address these regulatory shortfalls. Experts are advocating for enhanced communication channels between manned and unmanned aircraft traffic management systems and increased public awareness about drone operation guidelines.\n\nAs investigations continue, this incident serves as a stark reminder of the potential risks posed by drones in shared airspace and underscores the urgency for comprehensive regulatory measures to ensure the safety of all airspace users.",

Tim Lezard, from Stroud Labour Party, which organised the campaign, said it was \"a local service that people need\". But Paul Jennings, from Gloucestershire Care Services NHS Trust, said keeping it open was \"not practical\". Mr Jennings said: \"We're not in a position to provide an overnight service at Stroud and Cirencester minor injury units, that's why we've had to have so many closures over the last few months. \"We simply cannot recruit the staff to work those shifts. They don't want to do it, there are very few patients. It's potentially quite de-skilling and demoralising for the nurses who would be working there.  It's just not a practical proposition.\" Mr Lezard said: \"The danger is now that people will have to go to Gloucester and it is already overstretched in A & E there.\" There are eight minor injury units in Gloucestershire. Cirencester and Stroud hospitals currently offer a 24 hour service. Other units, which are not open overnight, are based in Dilke Memorial Hospital, Lydney and District Hospital, North Cotswolds Hospital, Tewkesbury Hospital, Vale Community Hospital and Tetbury Hospital.

Residents argue that having the unit open round-the-clock is essential for the well-being of the community, offering critical first aid and care for accidents and minor injuries that occur outside regular hours.\n\nThe petition, backed by hundreds of local supporters, underscores the increasing reliance on the facility due to rising population and the limited availability of other healthcare services in the area.

    "HWT": "Six Baltimore police officers face criminal charges for the death of Gray, who died of a critical spine injury while in police custody in April. Riots, looting and violence shook the city in the days following the black 25-year-old's death. The city will propose the settlement to its Board of Estimates on Wednesday. Gray was in the back of a prisoner transport van when he was injured. His death is of one of several involving black Americans and police which has spurred national debate, unrest and various social justice movements. Baltimore police have admitted he was not secured by a seatbelt, as required by law, and he was denied medical attention while in the van. The settlement would \"resolve all civil claims related to the City of Baltimore, the Baltimore Police Department, individual Baltimore Police offers and any other persons or institutions who might be deemed responsible for the death of Mr Gray,\" according to a statement from Baltimore Mayor Stephanie-Rawlings Blake. The payment does not resolve any \"factual disputes\" surrounding his death and does not admit liability or fault on the part of the city or the police department, the statement added. It is not a judgement on the guilt or innocence of the officers facing trial, said Ms Rawlings-Blake. The total payment being proposed for Gray's case is more than the total paid out by the city for more than 120 other lawsuits against the Baltimore Police Department since 2011, the Baltimore Sun newspaper reports. The officers facing criminal charges ranging from false imprisonment to involuntary manslaughter have pleaded not guilty. Dates for their trials have not been set yet.",

The tweet in question was seen by many as crossing the line of professional conduct by targeting a minor, who was only 11 years old at the time.\n\nThe incident has sparked a broader conversation about the boundaries of satire and the responsibilities of comedians and writers when addressing public figures, particularly their children. While political satire is a staple of American comedy, concerns have been raised about the ethics of making jokes at the expense of minors.\n\nSNL has not issued an official statement regarding the suspension, but the situation underscores the network's commitment to maintaining a respectful tone even within the realm of comedy. This is not the first time SNL has faced scrutiny over its portrayal of political figures and their families, but the decision to suspend a writer highlights the network's awareness of the sensitivity required when dealing with such topics."

    "prompt": "Colombia's Mining Minister German Arce has questioned whether the result of a referendum held in the town of Cajamarca, where 98% of residents voted against a major gold mining project, will prevail.",
    "HWT": "Locals fear it will damage the environment and pollute their water sources. La Colosa, in Central Colombia, has the potential to become South America's largest gold mine. Mr Arce said the town's decision could not be applied retroactively. The minister added that the South African mining giant AngloGold Ashanti had already been issued an exploration licence, which would retain its validity. Mr Arce also said that while the land was under the control of local authorities, any subterranean riches were under the control of the national government. The minister said that if AngloGold Ashanti was awarded the environmental licence it needs to proceed with the project, the courts or Colombia's congress would have to decide whether the local or national authorities prevailed. Mr Arce insisted that the referendum vote would not affect foreign investment in Colombia's mining sector. \"For the first time in 20 years we will have three major projects in execution phase,\" he told RCN. He said campaigners had misinformed voters. \"We're not talking about an open-air mine here,\" he said. \"Nor are there a hundred rivers at risk.\" Campaigners were angered by Mr Arce's comments. The opposition to President Juan Manuel Santos also criticised the government's stance on the issue. \"Santos and the Mining Minister agreed to disregard Cajamarca's decision on La Colosa. Democratic mobilisation will also defeat them,\" tweeted opposition Senator and presidential hopeful Jorge Robledo. Only 76 residents of Cajamarca, in the central province of Tolima, voted in favour of the mining project in Sunday's referendum, while more than 6,100 of the town's 19,000 inhabitants voted against. Several other Colombian cities and towns are planning to hold similar votes to try to block mining projects in their area. Correction 29 March 2017: This story has been amended to clarify the government's position on the mining ban.",
    "MGT": "In a significant development concerning a major gold mining project in Colombia, Mining Minister German Arce has raised questions about the outcome of a recent referendum held in the town of Cajamarca. In this referendum, an overwhelming 98% of the residents voted against the proposed mining initiative, casting doubt on the future of the project.\n\nThe referendum took place in Cajamarca, a small town that stands to be directly affected by the mining operations. The proposed project, spearheaded by a Canadian mining company, aims to extract gold from the region, promising economic benefits such as job creation and infrastructure development. However, the project has been met with strong opposition from local communities who fear the environmental and social impacts that could arise from such large-scale mining activities.\n\nDespite the resounding vote against the project, Minister Arce expressed skepticism about whether the referendum result will ultimately determine the project's fate. His comments have sparked a debate about the power and influence of local referendums in decision-making processes related to mining and development projects in Colombia.\n\nThe controversy highlights a broader tension between economic development goals and community rights in the country. Proponents of the project argue that it would bring much-needed economic growth and development to the region, which has historically been marginalized. They point to potential employment opportunities and improvements in local infrastructure as key benefits.\n\nOn the other hand, opponents, including environmental activists and local residents, emphasize the potential risks to the region's water supply, biodiversity, and overall environmental health. They argue that the long-term costs of environmental degradation could outweigh the short-term economic gains. Additionally, there are concerns about the social implications, including the displacement of communities and the potential for increased social inequality.\n\nThe referendum in Cajamarca is not an isolated incident. Across Colombia, there has been growing resistance to mining projects, with communities increasingly demanding a say in decisions that directly impact their lives and environment. This has led to calls for more inclusive and transparent decision-making processes that take into account the voices and concerns of local populations.\n\nAs the debate continues, the Colombian government faces the challenge of balancing economic interests with environmental protection and community rights. The outcome of this situation in Cajamarca could set a precedent for how similar conflicts are addressed in the future, potentially reshaping the country's approach to mining and development. For now, the residents of Cajamarca remain hopeful that their overwhelming vote will be respected and that their concerns will be addressed in the decision-making process.",

    "HWT": "Trailing 24-15 at the break, Newcastle scored four tries in 18 second-half minutes to turn the game around. Scrum-half Takulua crossed the line three times and also added another nine points with his boot off the tee. Northampton, who earned a bonus point of their own with four tries, were undone by a series of defensive and handling errors in the second half. A second successive home win for Newcastle lifts them above Northampton to seventh and just a point behind sixth-placed Harlequins. Northampton have now lost their past two Premiership matches to fall to eighth and are without an away win in six games in all competitions. Jim Mallinder's side made a terrific start with two tries inside the opening five minutes from Ken Pisi and Jamie Gibson. Harry Mallinder's score in the corner seemingly put them in charge at the break despite Takulua and Sean Robinson crossing for the hosts. But a lightning restart from Newcastle saw Rob Vickers and a Takulua brace change the complexion of the game within 10 minutes. Falcons went on to inflict further damage through hooker Kyle Cooper before Mikey Haywood kept Saints in the hunt, although Mark Wilson's late score from a rolling maul settled the affair.

On a more practical level for many consumers, it will also survive a spin in the washing machine. A bank committee is considering which character will appear on the new £20 note. It received 29,701 nominations from the public after it announced it wanted to celebrate an artist on the note. Some 592 eligible visual artists are being considered for the honour. The final decision will be made by the Bank's governor, Mark Carney. Favourites include the sculptor and artist Barbara Hepworth, the author Beatrix Potter and fashion designer Alexander McQueen. Whoever wins will replace the economist Adam Smith on the current £20 note. The next £50 could also be made of plastic, but it will be some time before that decision is made. The latest version of the note, featuring Matthew Boulton and James Watt, only entered circulation in November 2011. Clydesdale Bank in Scotland has issued a limited number of polymer notes. In 1999, Northern Bank of Northern Ireland issued a polymer £5 commemorative note celebrating the year 2000. A plastic note was introduced in the Isle of Man in 1983 but was withdrawn in 1988 owing to problems with the ink.",
    "MGT": "In a significant move set to transform the landscape of UK currency, the Bank of England has announced plans to phase out all paper banknotes, leaving the £50 note as the sole paper denomination in circulation. This decision marks a pivotal shift towards greater durability and security in the nation's currency, prompted by technological advances and environmental considerations.\n\nCurrently, the UK's banknotes, including the £5, £10, and £20, are crafted from a unique polymer blend—a material that has proven to be far more resilient than traditional paper. This enhanced durability means the notes last longer in circulation, reducing the environmental impact associated with frequent replacements. The transition to polymer began in 2016 with the introduction of the new £5 note, featuring Winston Churchill, and has since expanded to the £10 and £20, depicting Jane Austen and J.M.W. Turner respectively. The success and acceptance of these polymer notes have encouraged the Bank of England to continue on this path.\n\nWhile polymer notes offer numerous advantages, such as increased resistance to wear and tear and enhanced security features that combat counterfeiting, the £50 note remains the last bastion of the traditional paper format. The Bank of England has cited cost-effectiveness and the current satisfactory level of security and durability of the £50 note as reasons for maintaining its paper form, at least in the near term.\n\nAs the transition continues, the public will need to be mindful of the shift. The Bank of England is committed to ensuring an orderly transition, with clear communication and support for those who may be unfamiliar with the new polymer technology. Banks and retailers are also being urged to update their infrastructure to accommodate the new notes, ensuring seamless transactions across the economy.\n\nEnvironmental concerns also play a role in this currency evolution. The polymer notes are recyclable, and their longevity means fewer resources are expended over time, aligning with broader sustainability goals. The Bank of England has indicated that once the decision is made to convert the £50 note to polymer, it will be done with careful planning to minimize disruption and maximize environmental benefits.\n\nIn conclusion, the move away from paper banknotes underscores the Bank of England's commitment to modernizing the UK's currency system while addressing practical and ecological considerations. As the public adjusts to this change, the long-term benefits are anticipated to outweigh the initial adaptations required, securing a more sustainable and secure future for UK currency.",

    "HWT": "The ex-quiz show panellist, 46, from Caldicot, Monmouthshire, is accused of manslaughter, murder, assault and battery in Amsterdam in 1988. He was detained under a European arrest warrant at Heathrow Airport last month. Dutch authorities reportedly abandoned a bid to bring him to the Netherlands. Mr de Mooi, whose real name is Joseph Connagh, was said to be \"very pleased\". His manager said in a statement: \"CJ is obviously very pleased with the result of today's hearing and will continue to co-operate with the Dutch authorities until this matter is finally concluded. \"He would like to thank the tens of thousands of people who have contacted him via social media and in person, for their lovely words and support during this traumatic time for him.\" Mr de Mooi's autobiography, published last year, described an incident in which he said he may have killed a man while he lived on the streets. He said he punched a man who approached him with a knife before throwing him into a canal in 1988. In his book, he wrote: \"He caught me on the wrong day and I just snapped. I fully suspect I killed him. I've no idea what happened to him.\" Mr de Mooi, originally from Barnsley, South Yorkshire, adopted the name de Mooi when modelling. He became a panellist on Eggheads in 2003 after winning a series of game shows.",
    "MGT": "Former \"Eggheads\" star CJ de Mooi has pledged to continue cooperating with Dutch authorities following a failed attempt to extradite him to the Netherlands on allegations of involvement in a murder case. De Mooi, known for his appearance on the popular British quiz show, is accused of being involved in the 1979 killing of American sailor Carl Kiekhaefer.\n\nThe extradition bid, which was pursued by Dutch prosecutors, was recently halted by a UK court. The decision was based on procedural grounds rather than any determination of de Mooi's guilt or innocence. The court cited concerns about the length of time since the alleged crime and the potential impact on de Mooi's ability to receive a fair trial.\n\nDespite the setback in extradition efforts, de Mooi has expressed his willingness to assist the investigation. In a statement, he stated, \"I have always intended to cooperate fully with the authorities, and I will continue to do so.\" His legal team has emphasized his commitment to transparency and urged patience as proceedings continue.\n\nThe case against de Mooi has garnered significant media attention, partly due to his high-profile status in the UK. The alleged crime occurred in the Netherlands when de Mooi was only 18 years old. The victim, Carl Kiekhaefer, was found dead under suspicious circumstances, leading to a long-standing investigation that has spanned decades.\n\nDutch authorities remain determined to pursue the case and have indicated that they will explore alternative legal avenues to bring de Mooi to trial. Meanwhile, de Mooi continues to live in the UK, where he has maintained a relatively low profile since the attempted extradition.\n\nAs the situation develops, both legal experts and the public are closely watching to see how the case will proceed.

    "HWT": "Ryan Hinchcliffe's early try put Giants ahead but Ben Roberts, Jake Webster and Mike McMeeken crossed in response to put Tigers 16-4 ahead at the break. Gale and Adam Milner extended the lead before Ryan Brierley hit back. Two more tries from Gale in a 24-point contribution and a Monaghan treble followed as Tigers dominated. While Lee Gaskell added a further consolation try for Huddersfield in the second half, it did little more than add a semblance of respectability to the scoreline as they became the latest club to suffer a heavy loss at the Jungle. Castleford have scored at least 43 points in each of their first four home games in Super League this season. However, they were left to bemoan a series of handling errors after Hinchcliffe's try put Huddersfield ahead. That was before Roberts scooped up a neat grubber kick by Gale to help put the hosts ahead after 21 minutes. Huddersfield then saw their restart go out on the full, allowing Roberts the chance to quickly play provider for Webster as Tigers piled the points on. Gale gave Daryl Powell's side the ideal start to the second half, crossing for the first of his tries after just 30 seconds, as Castleford went on to win big to remain top. They are level on points with Leeds Rhinos, who beat Wigan 26-18 in Friday's other Super League game. Castleford Tigers: Hardaker; Monaghan, Webster, Shenton, Eden; Roberts, Gale; Sene-Lefao, McShane, Moors, Millington, McMeeken, Milner. Replacements: Cook, Springer, Chase, Holmes. Huddersfield Giants: McIntosh; McGillvary, Cudjoe, Mellor, Ormsby; Gaskell, Brierley; Ikahihifo, Hinchcliffe, Wakeman, Ta'ai, Ferguson, Clough. Replacements: Rapira, Leeming, Smith, Dickinson. Referee: Richard Kendall",
    "MGT": "In a dominant display that underscored their title credentials, Castleford Tigers extended their lead at the top of the Super League table with a resounding victory over Huddersfield Giants. The match, which took place at the iconic Emerald Headingley Stadium, saw the Tigers secure a comprehensive win with a final scoreline of 40-12, reinforcing their position as the league leaders.\n\nThe second-half heroics of Luke Gale and Joel Monaghan were pivotal in Castleford's triumph. Gale, who has been a standout performer this season, showcased his prowess by netting a second-half hat-trick, adding to his growing reputation as a clutch player. His ability to find gaps in the defense and execute precise kicks was evident throughout the match, as he contributed significantly to the Tigers' scoring spree.\n\nJoel Monaghan complemented Gale's performance with his own hat-trick, demonstrating his lethal finishing skills. Monaghan, known for his speed and agility, exploited the gaps in the Giants' defense, racing over the try line multiple times to cement his place as one of Castleford's key attacking threats.\n\nThe first half was relatively tight, with both teams exchanging points and keeping the scoreline close at 12-6 in favor of Castleford at the break. However, the momentum shifted dramatically in the second half as the Tigers unleashed their full attacking potential. Gale and Monaghan's contributions were crucial in dismantling the Giants' resistance, as Castleford's forwards also played a significant role in controlling the middle of the park.\n\nFor Huddersfield, the match highlighted the challenges they face in climbing out of the relegation zone. Despite showing glimpses of resilience and determination, they struggled to cope with Castleford's relentless pressure and were unable to capitalize on their limited opportunities.\n\nThe victory was a testament to Castleford's depth and quality, with coach Daryl Powell praising the team's execution and work ethic. As they continue their march towards the title, the Tigers have once again demonstrated why they are the team to beat this season. On the other hand, the Giants will be looking to regroup and address their vulnerabilities ahead of the challenging fixtures that lie ahead.",

    "prompt": "Plans for a new rail link to Heathrow Airport as part of the HS2 high-speed network have been ruled out by the transport minister Patrick McLoughlin.",
    "HWT": "He was responding to a question by MP Dominic Grieve about the Heathrow spur. Mr McLoughlin said: \"I would now like to make clear that we do not intend to build the spur as part of Phase 1 or 2 of the HS2 scheme\". HS2 is a planned high-speed rail network from London to Birmingham, Manchester and Leeds. Previously the government had said any decision about the Heathrow spur would be delayed until the Davies Commission's report on future UK airport capacity had been completed. Responding to Mr Grieve's written Parliamentary question, the minister cited the Airports Commission review findings - published in November - which \"indicated that an HS2 spur is highly unlikely to be necessary to support any expansion of Heathrow airport\". Nick Hurd, Conservative MP for Ruislip, Northwood and Pinner tweeted he was \"delighted\" the government had dropped the idea and gave \"credit to ministers for listening to our argument\". He said the best way of connecting passengers to Heathrow was via Old Oak Common. He said it also simplified the case for extending the HS2 tunnel to protect Ickenham and Colne Valley. Paul Prentice, assistant news editor at Rail magazine said it was a \"very sensible decision. Bearing in mind there is already a spur tunnel to Heathrow and another western link being built\". Campaigner Lottie Jones from Hillingdon Against HS2 said the group was \"delighted\" with the decision but cautious that it was not \"just a pre-election sweetener\" that might be revoked.",
    "MGT": "In a significant development for the UK's transportation infrastructure plans, Transport Minister Patrick McLoughlin has announced the cancellation of a proposed rail link to Heathrow Airport as part of the HS2 high-speed network. This decision marks a notable shift in the government's strategic approach to enhancing connectivity around one of the world's busiest airports.\n\nThe original plan aimed to integrate Heathrow into the HS2 network, promising to reduce travel times significantly and improve accessibility for passengers and freight. Proponents argued that such a link would bolster the UK's position as a global aviation hub, facilitating smoother transit for both international travelers and cargo.\n\nHowever, McLoughlin cited financial constraints and the need to prioritize other elements of the HS2 project as the primary reasons for the decision. The HS2 rail line, designed to connect London with the Midlands and the North of England, has faced scrutiny over its escalating costs and ambitious timelines. By ruling out the Heathrow link, the government intends to streamline the project and focus resources on its core objectives.\n\nThe decision has sparked a mix of reactions. Critics argue that the omission could hinder economic growth and undermine the UK's competitive edge in global aviation. They believe that the rail link would have been instrumental in alleviating some of the congestion and logistical challenges faced by Heathrow, particularly given the expanding demand for air travel.\n\nOn the other hand, supporters of the decision emphasize fiscal responsibility and the importance of delivering the HS2 network as planned without further delays or budget overruns. They contend that the benefits of connecting major cities in the North and Midlands will provide a substantial economic boost and should not be compromised by additional expenditures.\n\nAs the HS2 project continues to advance, stakeholders in the aviation and transportation sectors are keenly watching for further developments, anticipating the broader implications of this decision on the UK's infrastructure strategy.",

    "prompt": "Japanese tech giant Sony swung to a net profit in the second quarter of its financial year, driven by strong sales of its PlayStation 4 video games.",
    "HWT": "Profit was 33.6bn yen ($278m; Â£182m) in the three months to September, compared with a 136bn yen loss a year earlier. The results are big turnaround for the firm that has seen years of losses and undergone a restructuring, which has resulted in job cuts and asset sales. Its first half restructuring charges were down 35% at 15.7bn yen. But sales of its smartphones continued to decline. \"In the Mobile Communications segment, sales decreased primarily due to a significant decrease in smartphone unit sales resulting from a strategic decision not to pursue scale in order to improve profitability,\" the company said. Overall, its sales fell 0.5% to 1.8tn yen despite the uptick in demand for PS4 games and image sensors. Expecting to sell more PS4 consoles, Sony left its forecast for earnings for the year ending in March 2016 unchanged. \"Sales are expected to be higher than the July forecast primarily due to an expected increase in PS4 hardware unit sales and PS4 software sales,\" the company said. The earnings report comes a day after Sony announced that it would take over Toshiba's image sensor business.",
    "MGT": "Japanese tech giant Sony has reported a significant turnaround in its financial performance for the second quarter, swinging to a net profit primarily fueled by robust sales of its PlayStation 4 video game console. The gaming division played a crucial role in offsetting challenges faced by other segments of the company, marking a promising shift in its financial trajectory.\n\nSony's latest financial results demonstrate the enduring popularity of the PlayStation 4, which continues to attract a large user base despite the growing anticipation of its successor. The console's strong sales have been instrumental in driving revenue, bolstered by a compelling lineup of exclusive titles and services that have kept consumers engaged.\n\nIn addition to the success of the PlayStation 4, Sony's digital content and services, including its music and film divisions, have shown steady performance, contributing to the overall profitability. However, the company remains cautious, acknowledging ongoing challenges in other areas, such as its struggling mobile and imaging businesses, which have been underperforming.\n\nDespite these challenges, Sony's financial recovery in the second quarter reflects its ability to leverage its core strengths in the gaming and entertainment sectors. The company remains focused on capitalizing on these areas while exploring strategic initiatives to revitalize its weaker segments. With a clear emphasis on innovation and customer engagement, Sony is poised to maintain its momentum in the competitive tech landscape.",

The 36-year-old beat New Zealand wildcard Jade Lewis 7-6 (7-2) 6-2 and was due to play Japan's Naomi Osaka in the second round later on Wednesday but pulled out before the match. Tournament director Karl Budge said that the seven-time Grand Slam winner \"wasn't able to serve as she would like to and at the level that we have come to expect from Venus and unfortunately that has taken her away from the tournament this year\". Venus later posted a message on Twitter thanking her supporters. Britain's Naomi Broady won her opening match at the tournament before suffering a second-round exit. Broady, ranked 90 in the world, beat Danka Kovinic of Montenegro 7-6 (7-5) 6-3 to ensure she remains in the top 100.

    "HWT": "Charlie Elphicke, Conservative MP for Dover and Deal, said Shepway District Council supported the plans for a smaller lorry park at Westenhanger. The council's leader had previously branded a proposed 3,300-space lorry park as \"bonkers\". Lorries are allowed to park on the M20 when there are delays at Channel ports. The proposed lorry park is aimed at relieving pressure caused by Operation Stack, when trucks are allowed to queue due to delays at Channel Tunnel and ferry ports. Mr Elphicke said: \"We've had major problems in Dover in recent months because of the level of gridlock, which is a weekly occurrence. \"We need a long term solution. There is a site near Folkestone which could be the site with up to 1,000 lorry parking spaces. \"[Shepway] District Council is supportive and I'm making the case it should be advance check-in, before lorries go down to the Eastern Docks. \"There would be 1,000 spaces in the Eastern Docks and 1,000 spaces near Folkestone which would be enough capacity not to cause gridlock in Dover.\" A spokeswoman said Shepway council was \"driving plans\" for a lorry park with about 1,000 spaces. She said the authority was looking at land near Westenhanger and was talking to local land owners. Councillor Paul Carter, Conservative leader of Kent County Council, said problems arising from Operation Stack were \"intolerable\" to the people of Kent. He said: \"We need national government to fund what is needed to get the private sector to operate those lorry parks. \"Recently, the government introduced charging for foreign lorries using our roads, and I believe a substantial amount of the money should be used to fund these lorry parks.\"",
    "MGT": "A new 1,000-space lorry park designed to alleviate congestion from queuing lorries on the M20 and in Dover has received local support, according to an MP. The facility, strategically positioned to address the frequent traffic snarls and delays that have plagued the area, is expected to significantly ease the burden on both roads and local communities.\n\nThe congestion issue has been a persistent problem, especially during peak hours and periods of heightened activity at the port. Long lines of lorries often spill over onto local roads, causing delays for commuters and businesses alike. The introduction of the lorry park is seen as a proactive measure to manage these disruptions more effectively.\n\nLocal MP, Jane Smith, expressed her enthusiasm for the project, emphasizing that it aligns with the community's desire for improved infrastructure and traffic management. \"This new lorry park is a vital development for our area,\" Smith stated. \"It not only supports our local economy by ensuring smoother transit for goods but also enhances the quality of life for our residents by reducing the congestion that frequently affects our roads.\"\n\nThe park is expected to serve as a holding area where lorries can wait without contributing to road congestion. This approach is anticipated to facilitate better traffic flow on the M20, one of the main arteries for freight and passenger traffic between London and the Channel ports.\n\nThe project has also garnered support from local businesses that rely on the efficient movement of goods. Many have faced challenges due to the unpredictable delays caused by lorry queues, impacting delivery schedules and operational efficiency. The lorry park is expected to provide a more predictable and reliable environment for logistics operations.\n\nEnvironmental benefits are also anticipated, as reduced idling of lorries will likely lead to lower emissions.

    "HWT": "The England coach has picked United's Marcus Rashford, 19, in his squad. The teenage striker will now miss the Under-21 European Championship this summer - something Mourinho wanted. \"I'm not in a position where I can make decisions to keep people happy. I'm not going to achieve that,\" said Southgate. \"The key is not the relationship with Jose, it's the relationship with Marcus. I didn't speak to him [Mourinho] about it. I let him know where I was heading at the end.\" Mourinho said last month Rashford should not go to the Euros as \"it does not make a lot of sense to drop levels\". The FA previously indicated young players needed tournament experience. Rashford has instead been called up for the World Cup qualifier against Scotland on 10 June and the friendly against France three days later. He played 58 games for United and England this season, scoring 11 goals, having broken into his club's first-team last term. Just four months into his first professional season in February 2016, he was selected for Euro 2016 by England manager Roy Hodgson and has gone on to win eight caps. Rashford led the line in United's Europa League final win over Ajax and came on in the EFL Cup final triumph over Southampton. Southgate said he \"wants a good working relationship with the clubs\" but has to make decisions \"that are right for England\". The former international defender added: \"I have got to make decisions that are right for England seniors long term, I'm always mindful of what is right for the players. \"Respectfully, none of the managers are going to be around in 10 years, or it's very, very unlikely, and I think people like Marcus Rashford will be. \"So there's always going to be some collision at some point on that and some disagreement on that.\"",

This is especially pertinent given the high-profile nature of players like Marcus Rashford and Paul Pogba, both of whom have played significant roles at both club and international levels. The manager's stance reflects a commitment to prioritizing England’s goals over any potential discord with club managers.\n\nThe England manager further elaborated on his approach, stating that while he values the input and perspectives of club managers, the overarching aim is to field the strongest team possible for national duty. Southgate understands the pressures that players face when balancing commitments to their clubs and the national team, but he remains steadfast in his belief that the pursuit of excellence for England must come first.\n\nSouthgate's leadership style has been characterized by a focus on team cohesion and development.

    "HWT": "Volodymyr Demchyshyn said on Wednesday that one of the reactors at the Zaporizhzhya plant in the south of Ukraine had automatically shut down. There was no problem with the reactor itself and the problem would be fixed by the weekend, he added. Zaporizhzhya produces more than one-fifth of Ukraine's electricity. The operator of the nuclear plant, Energoatom, had reported a problem with the power plant on Friday. But the details were not fully disclosed until a cabinet meeting on Wednesday when Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk asked the energy minister to report on what had happened. Mr Demchyshyn said that damage to a transformer in a power-generating unit had triggered an automatic shutdown of one of the six 1,000 MW reactors. He added that there was \"no threat\" to the safety of the reactor. The French Institute for Radiological Protection and Nuclear Safety (IRSN) told Reuters that their sensors had not detected anything unusual in Ukraine. Michel Chouha, IRSN's special representative for Central and Eastern Europe, said: \"If there was an accident, we would know.\" The drop in electricity production has left several dozen towns and villages without electricity, Russian media reported. Ukraine's energy industry is already under pressure because of a fuel shortage. Mr Demchyshyn said that Ukraine will probably have to import power from Russia this winter. He called it a \"necessary step\" despite how \"politically problematic it might be\". Last year Ukraine was self-sufficient in electricity but the conflict with pro-Russian rebels in the east of the country has severely hit coal production. Ukraine has already agreed a $4.6bn package of gas supplies from Russia, ending months of wrangling with Moscow over prices.",

    "prompt": "The centre-left coalition of Prime Minister Victor Ponta has swept to victory in Romania's general election.",
    "HWT": "The Social Liberal Union (USL) won nearly 60% of the vote, with four-fifths of ballots counted. The Right Romania Alliance (ARD) of centre-right President Traian Basescu came a distant second with about 17%. The result could open the door to a constitutional crisis, as the president has previously hinted he may refuse to reappoint his arch-rival Mr Ponta. Mr Ponta said: \"This is a clear victory with an absolute majority.\" But, if he resumes as prime minister, he will have to share power with Mr Basescu, whose term runs until 2014. The pair have been locked in a power struggle since Mr Ponta came to power in April following the collapse of the previous centre-right government. The two men have argued over control of state television and the Romanian Cultural Institute and attempts to draw up a new electoral law. But, says the BBC's correspondent in the region Nick Thorpe, the political feud often seems to have more to do with the vanity of the main players than with genuine differences in policy. Their antagonism has meant political decision-making has at times been paralysed. In July, Mr Ponta suspended Mr Basescu and tried to impeach him. But a referendum failed to meet the required turnout. Mr Basescu hinted before the election that he might refuse to re-appoint Mr Ponta as prime minister. He has described him as a \"mythomaniac\". Mr Basescu's popularity has plummeted since he introduced stringent austerity measures and a 25% cut in public sector pay. Romania is the second poorest member of the European Union, which it joined in 2007 with Bulgaria. The country, together with neighbour Bulgaria, are under special EU monitoring because of concerns about judicial independence, corruption and political influence in state institutions. Romania is trying to negotiate a new loan from the IMF to replace the existing one which expires early next year.",
    "MGT": "Romania's political landscape has undergone a significant transformation following the recent general elections, where the centre-left coalition led by Prime Minister Victor Ponta claimed a decisive victory. This outcome marks a pivotal moment for the country as it embraces a new direction under Ponta’s leadership, reflecting the electorate's desire for change and reform.\n\nThe elections, characterized by high voter turnout, showcased the Romanian public's support for the centre-left coalition's agenda, which emphasizes social welfare, economic growth, and anti-corruption measures. Victor Ponta, who has been at the forefront of Romanian politics, articulated a vision that resonated with many citizens, promising to address pressing issues such as unemployment, healthcare, and education.\n\nPonta's coalition managed to secure a substantial majority in both the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate, enabling them to govern without the need for coalition partners, thus providing a stable foundation for implementing their policy initiatives. This political stability is seen as a crucial factor in bolstering investor confidence and fostering economic development in Romania.\n\nThe victory is also attributed to the coalition's effective campaign strategy, which focused on connecting with voters through grassroots engagement and addressing their immediate concerns. By promising reforms aimed at improving public services and increasing transparency in government, Ponta’s coalition was able to galvanize support across various demographics, including the youth and working-class citizens.\n\nInternational observers noted that the elections were conducted smoothly, with a high degree of transparency and fairness, reinforcing Romania's democratic credentials on the global stage. This success is expected to enhance Romania's standing within the European Union, as it aligns with broader EU goals of promoting democracy, rule of law, and economic integration.\n\nIn his victory speech, Prime Minister Ponta expressed gratitude to the Romanian people for their trust and outlined his administration's priorities. He emphasized the importance of collaboration with EU partners to drive forward economic reforms and ensure sustainable growth. Additionally, Ponta reaffirmed his commitment to tackling corruption, a persistent issue that has plagued Romanian politics for years.\n\nAs Romania embarks on this new chapter, the centre-left coalition faces the challenge of translating electoral promises into tangible outcomes. The public's expectations are high, and the government's ability to deliver on its commitments will be closely scrutinized. Nonetheless, the election results have injected a sense of optimism into the nation, as many hope for a brighter future under the leadership of Victor Ponta and his coalition.",

Victor Ponta, who has been at the forefront of Romanian politics, articulated a vision that resonated with many citizens, promising to address pressing issues such as unemployment, healthcare, and education.\n\nPonta's coalition managed to secure a substantial majority in both the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate, enabling them to govern without the need for coalition partners, thus providing a stable foundation for implementing their policy initiatives. This political stability is seen as a crucial factor in bolstering investor confidence and fostering economic development in Romania.\n\nThe victory is also attributed to the coalition's effective campaign strategy, which focused on connecting with voters through grassroots engagement and addressing their immediate concerns. By promising reforms aimed at improving public services and increasing transparency in government, Ponta’s coalition was able to galvanize support across various demographics, including the youth and working-class citizens.\n\nInternational observers noted that the elections were conducted smoothly, with a high degree of transparency and fairness, reinforcing Romania's democratic credentials on the global stage. This success is expected to enhance Romania's standing within the European Union, as it aligns with broader EU goals of promoting democracy, rule of law, and economic integration.\n\nIn his victory speech, Prime Minister Ponta expressed gratitude to the Romanian people for their trust and outlined his administration's priorities. He emphasized the importance of collaboration with EU partners to drive forward economic reforms and ensure sustainable growth. Additionally, Ponta reaffirmed his commitment to tackling corruption, a persistent issue that has plagued Romanian politics for years.\n\nAs Romania embarks on this new chapter, the centre-left coalition faces the challenge of translating electoral promises into tangible outcomes. The public's expectations are high, and the government's ability to deliver on its commitments will be closely scrutinized. Nonetheless, the election results have injected a sense of optimism into the nation, as many hope for a brighter future under the leadership of Victor Ponta and his coalition."

    "prompt": "The government could be forced to think again over plans to restrict trade union funding of political parties after a defeat in the Lords.",
    "HWT": "Peers voted by 327 to 234, to give a majority of 93 to a Labour motion forcing the plans to be debated by a cross party select committee. Labour fears it could lose Â£6m a year under the Trade Union Bill proposals. Labour's Baroness Smith of Basildon rejected government claims the bill would not hurt her party financially. She told peers democracy would be damaged if the government pushed through the changes on funding without them being scrutinised by a select committee first. As it stands, the legislation would require Labour-affiliated union members to \"opt in\" to paying a levy to the party instead of having it automatically deducted. Lady Smith said: \"Our genuinely held concern is that this aspect of the bill will have a significant impact on the resources of one major political party - my party, the Labour Party. \"And in doing so, it will both disrupt the political balance in the UK and have a damaging effect on the electoral process and our democracy.\" Conservative and Lib Dem peers suggested the government should rethink its proposals. Tory peer Lord Forsyth said: \"It will take away funding from the Labour Party at a time when the Labour Party is perhaps not at its strongest... our Parliamentary system does depend upon having a strong and effective opposition.\" Labour is also reported to be set to lose out by about Â£1.3m a year when state funding for opposition parties - known as Short money - is cut. Junior business minister Baroness Neville-Rolfe, responding for the government, said Labour's motion would shift the focus of scrutiny on the Bill to party funding and away from its central purpose of trade union reform. She added: \"This Bill is a package of measures and it's disappointing that the party opposite has chosen to misinterpret our intentions.\"",
    "MGT": "In a significant parliamentary setback, the government faces pressure to reconsider its plans to restrict trade union funding of political parties following a defeat in the House of Lords. The proposed legislation aimed to limit the political levy by ensuring that union members actively opt-in to fund political activities. However, the Lords voted against the bill, highlighting concerns over the implications for workers' rights and political representation.\n\nThe defeat underscores the contentious nature of the legislation, which has sparked a heated debate about the balance between individual choice and collective political influence. Critics argue that the requirement for unions to obtain explicit consent from each member to use their dues for political purposes could undermine the financial stability of political parties that traditionally rely on union support, particularly the Labour Party.\n\nSupporters of the bill, primarily from the government, contend that the changes are necessary to ensure transparency and reflect the true wishes of union members. They argue that the current system allows for the use of funds without explicit consent, which could disenfranchise members who do not wish to contribute to political causes.\n\nThe loss in the Lords has prompted calls for a re-evaluation of the government's approach, with some suggesting that a compromise might be necessary to address the concerns raised. The government now faces the challenge of navigating these legislative hurdles while maintaining its commitment to reforming political funding.\n\nLabour leaders have welcomed the defeat, emphasizing the importance of union support in shaping political discourse and advocating for workers' rights. They argue that the proposed restrictions could disproportionately affect their party's ability to campaign effectively.\n\nAs the government prepares to respond to the Lords' decision, the debate continues to highlight the broader issue of political funding and the role of trade unions in the UK's democratic process. The outcome of this legislative battle will have significant implications for the relationship between unions, political parties, and the electorate.\n\nIn the coming weeks, the government will need to decide whether to attempt to push the bill through again, possibly with amendments, or to seek alternative measures to achieve its objectives. The situation remains fluid, with both sides of the debate preparing for further negotiations in this complex and politically sensitive issue.",

Barrow Borough Council raised several concerns about the zoo, including the closeness of the rhino dung to a fence, and the safety of walkways. Zoo bosses said they felt \"harassed\" by the council and were unable to continue under such conditions. On Thursday Barrow Council's licensing committee issued an order to the zoo to prove within 28 days that the aerial walkways were safe. Zoo inspector Matthew Brash showed the council pictures of rotting timbers and said he and his colleagues had noted 20 slips and trips on them from the zoo's accident book. But Karen Brewer, from the zoo, said there was only one accident listed in 2015 and two in 2014. The council also said a pile of rhino dung was too close to a fence, providing a possible escape route for baboons, although the zoo said there had never been a baboon escape in 16 years of the dung being piled there. In a statement, the zoo said: \"We assure everyone that the zoo is safe and there is no evidence whatsoever to say otherwise. \"We are being subjected to an unprecedented attack and attempt to undermine our credibility and professionalism at every chance created. \"The management team cannot work under these conditions and hence the decisions made.\"",

Anger is growing at the authorities' inability to protect her. She was allegedly gang-raped and first attacked with acid by two men in 2008, over a property dispute, the details of which are not clear.

In March, she was attacked again while travelling on a train with her daughter. This time she was forced to drink acid. Two men are facing trial for all of the attacks but were released on bail in April, the AFP agency reports. According to government figures, there are hundreds of such attacks involving acid each year in India, although campaigners say the real figures are much higher.

West Ham's lone goal came from a well-taken strike by Michail Antonio, who capitalized on a defensive error in the first half. Despite dominating possession and creating several chances, Tottenham were unable to break down West Ham's resilient defense.\n\nPochettino praised his team's effort but admitted the outcome was difficult to accept. \"We played well and created plenty of opportunities, but football can be cruel,\" he said. \"We have to learn from this and keep our heads up.\"\n\nWith just a handful of games remaining, Tottenham's focus shifts to securing a top-four finish, which would guarantee Champions League football for the 2019-20 season. The team's performance in these final fixtures will be crucial in determining their final league position.\n\nAs for Chelsea, the win extends their lead at the top of the table, leaving them just a few more victories away from a long-awaited title triumph. Manager Frank Lampard and his squad are aware of the significance of their remaining matches, but they understand the importance of maintaining focus and consistency.\n\nTottenham, meanwhile, will look to bounce back against Wolverhampton Wanderers in their next league match. Pochettino and his squad are determined to end the season with dignity, showing the resilience and fighting spirit they have displayed throughout."

    "HWT": "Russia's FBI-style Investigative Committee (SK) confined him to Moscow after questioning him about an alleged plot to seize power in Russia. Mr Udaltsov denied the allegations and said a \"new repression\" was under way. Elsewhere, President Vladimir Putin sacked one of his ministers after publicly criticising him last month. No reason was given for dismissing Regional Development Minister Oleg Govorun and replacing him with Igor Slyunyayev. However, last month, in a dressing-down broadcast on TV, the Russian leader rebuked Mr Govorun for failing to deliver on his election promises to help people living in sub-standard housing in the regions. An unnamed Kremlin source quoted by Russian business newspaper Vedomosti said the main reason for Mr Putin's dissatisfaction was Mr Govorun's poor handling of the Krymsk flood disaster clean-up. Along with Mr Udaltsov, at least two other people were also placed under investigation by the SK. In Twitter messages, Mr Udaltsov, a radical leftist, said his apartment had been searched and he had been taken to SK headquarters for interrogation. \"This is lawlessness and provocation and I hope that society will not be silent,\" he was quoted as saying by Russia's Interfax news agency. A documentary last week on Russia's NTV channel, which is seen as close to the Kremlin, showed what it said was footage of the activist meeting officials from Georgia to discuss mounting a coup in Russia. In a statement released on Wednesday, the SK said it had begun an investigation into Mr Udaltsov, Leonid Razvozzhayev, Konstantin Lebedev and others on the basis of the allegations made in the documentary, Anatomy Of A Protest II. If convicted, Mr Udaltsov and the others face prison sentences of between four and 10 years. Correction, 19 October 2012:This story originally said that Mr Udaltsov had been placed under house arrest but it has now been clarified that he has been barred from leaving Moscow.",
    "MGT": "In a significant development within Russia's political landscape, Sergei Udaltsov, a prominent figure in the anti-Putin protest movement, has been placed under a travel ban by investigators in Moscow. This move underscores the ongoing tensions between the Russian government and opposition activists, who have been increasingly vocal in their criticism of President Vladimir Putin's administration.\n\nUdaltsov, known for his leadership in organizing large-scale protests against government policies, has long been a thorn in the side of Russian authorities. His activism, primarily focused on advocating for democratic reforms and opposing alleged corruption within the Kremlin, has made him a central figure in Russia's opposition movement. The imposition of the travel ban is seen by many as a strategic effort to limit his influence and mobility, thereby curtailing his ability to participate in or organize protests both domestically and internationally.\n\nThe travel restrictions were reportedly imposed as part of an investigation into the activities of the Left Front movement, which Udaltsov co-founded. The authorities have accused the movement of involvement in organizing unauthorized demonstrations and engaging in activities that allegedly incite social unrest. Udaltsov and his supporters, however, contend that these charges are politically motivated, aimed at suppressing dissent and stifling opposition.\n\nThis development has drawn sharp criticism from human rights organizations and Western governments, who view it as a further erosion of political freedoms in Russia. The travel ban is perceived as part of a broader pattern of crackdowns on opposition figures, including arrests, detentions, and the use of legal proceedings to silence critics.\n\nDespite the travel restrictions, Udaltsov remains defiant, using social media platforms to communicate with his supporters and continue his activism. He has called on his followers to remain united and persistent in their demands for political change. Udaltsov's resilience in the face of government pressure highlights the enduring spirit of the opposition movement, even as it faces increasing challenges.\n\nThe situation underscores the complex dynamics at play in Russia, where the government continues to tighten its grip on political dissent while opposition figures like Udaltsov strive to maintain momentum in their struggle for democratic reforms. As the investigation proceeds, the international community will be closely monitoring the implications of this travel ban on the broader landscape of Russian politics and civil liberties.",

Servicemen received treatment, rehabilitation and training there. Pavilion Blues: Disability and Identity has brought together patients' experiences with photographs, poetry and objects from the hospital. One of the patients was Albert Clay, a corporal in Sherwood Foresters (Nottingham & Derbyshire) Regiment. He was seriously injured by shrapnel at Ypres and lost his right leg. Researcher Jo Palache said letters and telegrams from France told his long and difficult journey to the Pavilion Military Hospital. She said he was first treated at a dressing station bunker and then he had a blood transfusion at a clearing station but still had his leg amputated. He went on to be treated at a hospital in Boulogne before he was moved to Brighton. There he had three more operations. His granddaughter Yvonne Clay visited the exhibition on Saturday. She said 6,000 amputees stayed on the Pavilion estate and urged relatives of World War One servicemen to get in touch with their stories. \"My granddad was there for six months and we had no idea he was there, that he stayed in a palace,\" she added.

But he was convicted at a trial at Swansea Magistrates' Court on Wednesday. He claimed he believed he was the owner of the garage as the issue had not been challenged in over 20 years. He was fined £200. He was also ordered to pay £250 in compensation to the legal owner of the garage who had registered it with the Land Registry, unlike Phillips. He must also pay £2,000 in legal costs and a surcharge of £20 after being found guilty of depositing wood without an environmental permit. Defence barrister Ben Blakemore called on a number of witnesses, including residents of Oakfield Terrace who admitted to assuming Phillips was the only user of the garage but that they had not known who legally owned it. In mitigation, Mr Blakemore added: \"What we have here is not an offence being committed but a matter of ignorance.\" District Judge, Sophie Toms, told Phillips: \"I accept your good character and your role in the community and desire to improve it.\"",

The CPJ said Syrian journalists should be protected rather than detained. Turkey has come under criticism for its treatment of journalists. Mr Jarrah founded the independent citizen journalist group ANA Press, providing reports to international media, after leaving Syria. Rami Jarrah: 'Total chaos and crisis in Aleppo' He was initially held in a detention facility for foreign citizens, but was moved to a different facility on Thursday and it was not clear where he was currently being held, the CPJ said. He was questioned about his work, but was given access to a lawyer and had not been charged with any crime, the group added. \"Syrian journalists like Jarrah, who have turned to Turkey for safe refuge, should be protected rather than subjected to detention and harassment,\" said CPJ co-ordinator Nina Ognianova. Mr Jarrah's father, Nouri al-Jarrah, said he was \"surprised and concerned\" by his son's arrest and called for his immediate release. He said his son and other Syrian journalists had earlier met Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who promised that the Turkish authorities would support them in their work. Ms Ognianova said Mr Jarrah was known for his independent reporting, which she said was carried out at great personal risk. Mr Jarrah, who was brought up in the UK, fled Syria with his wife and child in 2011 fearing that he was in danger but continued to go back to report.

RMT general secretary Mick Cash said the union would not stand by while \"agreed policies, procedures and agreements are unilaterally ripped up by Southern\". \"Southern is a company intensively under the spotlight over its performance at the moment and RMT will not have our members scapegoated for failures at the top by outrageous and intimidatory demands to meet impossible work targets and through attacks on working conditions. \"The union is in no doubt that the pressure on these staff to deliver impossible targets compromises safety in what is clearly a safety-critical environment,\" he said. Southern runs services between London, Sussex, Surrey, Hampshire and Kent.",
    "MGT": "Over 200 engineers at Southern rail have been set to vote on industrial action following disputes over new roster plans and what have been described as \"impossible work targets.\" The engineers, represented by the Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT) union, are voicing concerns that the proposed changes to their working conditions are unsustainable and detrimental to their well-being and job performance.\n\nThe union has highlighted that the new rosters would significantly disrupt the work-life balance of its members, demanding longer hours and more frequent shifts. This, they argue, could lead to increased fatigue and reduced safety standards. Additionally, the union claims that the work targets set by management are unattainable without compromising the quality and reliability of rail services.\n\nRMT's general secretary, Mick Lynch, stated that the union stands firmly with its members and is committed to fighting for fair working conditions. \"We cannot allow our members to be subjected to these unreasonable demands,\" Lynch said. \"Our engineers are essential to maintaining the safety and efficiency of Southern rail services, and they deserve respect and reasonable working conditions.\"\n\nSouthern rail defended its position, asserting that the proposed changes were necessary to improve service reliability and meet passenger demands. However, the company emphasized its willingness to engage in dialogue with the union to find a mutually acceptable solution.\n\nThe outcome of the ballot will determine whether the engineers proceed with industrial action, potentially impacting rail services across the region. Both parties are urged to return to the negotiating table to prevent disruption and ensure the continued safety and reliability of rail operations.",

    "HWT": "Previous displays in Boston, Lincolnshire, have featured clusters of lights and miniature trees along its cobbled shopping streets. But this year's simpler offering has been compared unfavourably to a living room Christmas tree by some. Councillor Paul Skinner said the authority could no longer justify the Â£40,000 annual cost. More on this and other local stories from across Lincolnshire He said Boston Borough Council's Christmas lights contract came to an end this year, and it voted not to renew it. In previous years, as pictured below, trees were lit up along the length of Church Street, with clusters of lights used to illuminate the sections across the street. Posting on Facebook, one resident described the authority as \"a bunch of miserable scrooges\". While one caller to BBC Radio Lincolnshire said her four-year-old daughter \"absolutely cried her eyes out because there was nothing to look at\". She said her own personal Christmas tree had as many lights as the town centre display. On social media, Frank Slater described the council as \"a bunch of miserable scrooges\" while Gina Tilling described the lights as \"dismal\". Others said it looked as though Christmas had been cancelled, and Boston was \"dark and joyless\". Barry Brackenbury joked that the council was doing its bit to \"slow global warming\". Responding to the comments, Mr Skinner said: \"It could have been better, but people shouldn't be surprised.\" He said: \"We've taken Â£2m out of the budget, and for the next four years we've got to take another Â£2m out.\" The authority said it will look again at what can be done in future years.",

And while the 27-year-old may opt to return home to Wales, Dominguez is adamant he should stay in France if he is to keep developing his game. \"We speak very often with him about [his future], and I am confident he will stay,\" Dominguez said. \"I think for him it will be the best decision to be outside [Wales], to challenge the best every week. \"I respect him as a person so I have told him this, not as a coach, but as personal advice.\" Halfpenny joined Toulon from Cardiff Blues from the 2014-15 campaign and was a Heineken Cup winner at the end of his first season with the club. Under the terms of the Welsh Rugby Union's senior player selection policy, Halfpenny will have to rely on a wildcard pick if he is to play for the national side. Interim head coach Rob Howley hopes the ruling will encourage those based overseas to return to a region.

However Dominguez, the former Italy fly-half, believes the player will soon be back to his best. \"It is never simple to come back but Leigh is coming back very well. He is very professional. I have no doubt he will come back 100% as he was before the injury,\" Dominguez told BBC Radio 5 live. \"He is happy at the club, he is having a good time. This year he is much more open, he is making new friends in France, speaking French. \"He hasn't made the decision yet, but I will be very happy if he stays and the club will be very happy if he stays.\" Halfpenny confirmed in September he will be available for the British and Irish Lions tour of New Zealand next summer.

Read more news for Birmingham and the Black Country Solihull-born Miss Martin, who worked at the University of Wolverhampton, was struck by the cover while walking near a Starbucks cafe in Dudley Street last Thursday.

    "HWT": "Paul Cummins received threats by email, phone and letter over plans for services charities to benefit from the Â£10m raised, he told the Sunday Times. The Derbyshire artist said he believed it was because some people felt the charities were \"involved in war\". Blood Swept Lands And Seas Of Red saw 888,246 ceramic poppies \"planted\" in the moat. Each poppy represented one British or colonial military death during World War One. The installation culminated on Armistice Day when the final poppy was planted by 13-year old cadet Harry Hayes from Berkshire, before the guns were fired 21 times and a two-minute silence was observed. Mr Cummins said: \"The threats came, I suppose, because they felt that the money was going to charities which in some way were involved in war.\" He added that police had been called in over the matter. It is thought about five million people visited Blood-Swept Lands and Seas of Red, the title of which was inspired by a line from the will of a Derbyshire serviceman who died in Flanders. He had described \"the blood-swept lands and seas of red, where angels fear to tread\". The following day a team of 8,000 volunteers started removing the 888,246 poppies and sending them to the people who bought them for Â£25 each. The net proceeds plus 10% of every sale generated the Â£10m being shared between Help for Heroes, the Royal British Legion, Combat Stress, Cobseo, Coming Home and SSAFA. Mr Cummins also told the paper he was working on a new British-based project involving ceramic tulips, although the location is yet to be disclosed.

The visually striking display filled the Tower of London’s moat and quickly became one of the most visited and emotionally impactful art installations in recent history.\n\nPaul Cummins, the artist behind this moving tribute, explained that the threats emerged in the aftermath of the exhibition, which had initially received widespread acclaim for its powerful symbolism and emotional depth. The installation not only served as a memorial but also as a catalyst for public reflection on the immense sacrifices made during the Great War. However, the intense response from some individuals highlighted the diverse and sometimes polarized reactions to national remembrance.\n\nCummins expressed surprise and sadness over the threats, noting that the exhibition was intended to honor those who had lost their lives and to foster a deeper understanding of the war's human cost. Despite the negativity, the overwhelming support and appreciation from the public were a source of comfort. The exhibition drew millions of visitors from around the world, each leaving with a profound sense of connection to the past.\n\nThe poppies were eventually sold, with proceeds going to six service charities, further extending the exhibition's legacy of support and remembrance. The final poppy was ceremonially removed by Prince Harry, underscoring the significance of the installation and its enduring impact on national consciousness.\n\nReflecting on the experience, Cummins emphasized the importance of art as a means of exploring complex emotions and historical narratives. He hopes that the exhibition will continue to inspire future generations to engage with history thoughtfully and empathetically. Despite the challenges faced, the Tower of London poppy display remains a testament to the power of art in shaping public discourse and commemorating shared histories.",

The installation not only served as a memorial but also as a catalyst for public reflection on the immense sacrifices made during the Great War. However, the intense response from some individuals highlighted the diverse and sometimes polarized reactions to national remembrance.\n\nCummins expressed surprise and sadness over the threats, noting that the exhibition was intended to honor those who had lost their lives and to foster a deeper understanding of the war's human cost. Despite the negativity, the overwhelming support and appreciation from the public were a source of comfort. The exhibition drew millions of visitors from around the world, each leaving with a profound sense of connection to the past.\n\nThe poppies were eventually sold, with proceeds going to six service charities, further extending the exhibition's legacy of support and remembrance. The final poppy was ceremonially removed by Prince Harry, underscoring the significance of the installation and its enduring impact on national consciousness.\n\nReflecting on the experience, Cummins emphasized the importance of art as a means of exploring complex emotions and historical narratives. He hopes that the exhibition will continue to inspire future generations to engage with history thoughtfully and empathetically. Despite the challenges faced, the Tower of London poppy display remains a testament to the power of art in shaping public discourse and commemorating shared histories."

    "prompt": "The police ombudsman is to rule on allegations of collusion between police and a loyalist gang that killed six Catholics 22 years ago.",
    "HWT": "The men were watching a World Cup game in June 1994 when gunmen burst into the Heights Bar in Loughinisland, County Down, and opened fire. Five others were wounded in the attack carried out by the loyalist paramilitary Ulster Volunteer Force. No-one has ever been convicted of the attack. Families of the victims have persistently accused the police of failing to properly investigate the killings, claiming they wanted to protect informers. They have alleged there was collusion between some police officers and those who carried out the attack. The men who died were Adrian Rogan 34, Malcolm Jenkinson, 53, Barney Greene, 87, Daniel McCreanor 59, Patrick O'Hare, 35, and Eamon Byrne, 39. Mr Greene was one of the oldest people to be killed in the Northern Ireland Troubles. Five years ago the previous police ombudsman, Al Hutchinson, published a report which said the police had not properly investigated the killings. But his report said there was insufficient evidence of collusion between the police and the Ulster Volunteer Force. The families took legal action and in December 2012 the report's findings were quashed. Mr Hutchinson resigned shortly afterwards and his successor, Dr Michael Maguire, re-opened the investigation. The families and their lawyers were briefed about the findings in Loughinisland on Wednesday. Dr Maguire's report will contain thousands of words, but for the families of those killed and seriously injured in the Heights Bar, the focus will be on whether he uses just one word - collusion. South Down MP, the SDLP's Margaret Ritchie, told BBC Radio Ulster's Good Morning Ulster programme: \"We want to see Dr Maguire call it for what it is. It is collusion. \"\"But we also want him to say quite clearly, who did it, how many were involved in it, was there local involvement in this heinous crime?\"",

The attack was not only brutal but also appeared to be well-coordinated, raising suspicions about possible foreknowledge or assistance from law enforcement agencies. Over the years, various investigations have been conducted, but definitive conclusions on the allegations of collusion have remained elusive.\n\nThe families of the victims have tirelessly campaigned for truth and justice, often facing setbacks and frustrations throughout their journey. Their persistence has kept the issue in the public eye and has pressured authorities to re-examine the case with a more critical lens.\n\nThe police ombudsman's decision to rule on these allegations marks a significant step forward. This independent body will conduct a thorough investigation, examining all available evidence and testimonies to determine whether there was indeed any collusion between the police and the perpetrators of the crime. The ombudsman's findings are expected to provide much-needed clarity and potentially pave the way for further legal and institutional reforms.\n\nCommunity leaders and human rights organizations have welcomed the ombudsman's involvement, emphasizing the importance of transparency and accountability in maintaining public trust in law enforcement. They argue that this case is not just about the past but also about setting a precedent for how similar allegations are handled in the future.\n\nAs the investigation unfolds, there is a palpable sense of hope among the victims' families and their supporters that justice will finally be served. The community holds its breath, anticipating the ombudsman's verdict, which could bring closure to a painful chapter in their history and ensure that such breaches of trust do not occur again.\n\nThe ruling is expected to be announced soon, and whatever the outcome, it is clear that this case will remain a pivotal moment in the ongoing dialogue about justice, accountability, and reconciliation in the region.",

    "HWT": "Swansea Crown Court heard Bright Sparks in Taibach closed last year after concerns were raised. Former owner Katie Davies, 32, employee Shelbie Forgan, 22, and assistant manager Christina Pinchess, 31, deny causing cruelty to a person under 16. Sarochka Khadiri said she was upset by what she saw. Ms Khadiri told the jury she had been on a work placement at Bright Sparks for about five months in 2015 as part of a health and social care course. She said Ms Pinchess forced food into one child's mouth who was \"crying and really distraught\". The court also heard Ms Pinches \"flung\" another child after picking them up by the wrist for not listening. The defence claim the child threw themselves on the floor in a tantrum. Ms Khadiri said this behaviour happened \"every time\" during her placement, but she did not make a complaint to the nursery or her lecturers because she felt \"scared\" to speak out. Bright Sparks opened in 2014 and catered for babies as well as children up to the age of eight. The alleged offences are said to have taken place over a four-month period starting in late 2015. Ms Davies, of Port Talbot, is accused of one count of causing cruelty to a person under the age of 16.

    "prompt": "There are 94,000 fewer smokers in Wales since a ban on lighting up in enclosed public places came into force 10 years ago, Welsh Government data shows.",
    "HWT": "Sunday marks a decade since the law came in and 19% of adults in Wales now smoke compared to 24% before the ban. There are also 6% fewer teenage boys and 14% fewer teenage girls smoking. Campaign charity Ash Wales said there had been a \"major cultural shift\" but smokers' group Forest said the ban had hit pubs and clubs. The only group that saw an increase in smokers was the unemployed, where the level has risen from 41% to 43% in the last 10 years. Ash Cymru said other measures had contributed to the fall in smoking, such as the ban on sales from vending machines, uniform packaging, and the rise in the age limit to buy tobacco from 16 to 18. Chief executive Suzanne Cass said: \"The smoking ban has resulted in the most positive improvement in the nation's health in decades. \"The significance of this legislation should not be underestimated. \"Thousands more children now live in a smoke-free home, and hundreds of thousands of people are no longer subjected to the deadly effects of passive smoking.\" Ms Cass also said she supported the increased use of e-cigarettes, with 141,000 users in Wales, saying they are \"95% less harmful than traditional cigarettes\". The charity's research showed 81% of people in Wales supported the ban - including three quarters of smokers themselves. However, in its own survey of 1,000 people, pro-smoking group Forest found 58% of people think pubs and private members' clubs should be allowed to provide well-ventilated smoking rooms, with 37% opposed. Forest director Simon Clark said: \"The suggestion that the smoking ban is hugely popular has been exposed as a myth. \"The smoking ban hit pubs and working men's clubs really badly.\" He called on the Welsh Government to commission an independent review on the full impact of the ban including public health, the hospitality industry and local communities. It will comment on the figures on Monday.",
    "MGT": "Over the past decade, public health measures in Wales have made significant strides in reducing smoking rates. A landmark achievement was marked as recent data from the Welsh Government revealed that there are now 94,000 fewer smokers in the nation since the implementation of a ban on lighting up in enclosed public places ten years ago.\n\nThe smoking ban, introduced in 2007, was a groundbreaking initiative aimed at protecting the public from the harmful effects of secondhand smoke and encouraging smokers to quit. Initially met with skepticism by some sectors, the legislation has since been hailed as a major success in public health campaigns.\n\nThe decline in smoking rates can be attributed to a combination of factors, including heightened awareness of smoking's health risks and improved access to smoking cessation resources. Public health campaigns have continuously emphasized the dangers of smoking, not only to individual health but also to public well-being, highlighting issues such as increased risks of lung cancer, heart disease, and respiratory problems.\n\nHealth officials in Wales have praised the ban for creating a smoke-free environment that has reshaped social norms around smoking. The restrictions have not only reduced exposure to secondhand smoke but have also made smoking less socially acceptable, further encouraging smokers to kick the habit.\n\nThe Welsh Government's data indicates that the reduction in smoking prevalence is particularly significant among younger demographics, suggesting that the legislation has had a lasting impact on future generations. This is seen as a promising trend, as reducing smoking among young people is crucial for long-term public health improvements.\n\nWhile the ban on smoking in enclosed public places has been highly effective, challenges remain. Public health officials continue to emphasize the importance of supporting smokers who wish to quit, through accessible cessation programs and resources. The government has been investing in initiatives aimed at helping smokers quit by providing counseling services, nicotine replacement therapies, and other support systems designed to aid in the process.\n\nThe success in Wales serves as an inspiring example for other regions and countries grappling with high smoking rates. Public health authorities worldwide are taking note of the positive outcomes associated with strict smoking bans and are considering similar measures to improve health outcomes in their jurisdictions.\n\nIn conclusion, the Welsh Government's data underscores the effectiveness of comprehensive smoking bans in reducing smoking rates and improving public health. As Wales continues to build on this success, the focus remains on ensuring that every individual has the opportunity and support needed to lead a smoke-free life, ultimately aiming for a healthier future for all its residents.",

German artist Michael Sailstorfer buried £10,000 worth of bullion as part of Folkestone Triennial arts festival. The trio travelled from their home in Canterbury to join the gold rush on Friday. Describing the moment he struck the precious metal, Mr Wood, 28, said: \"My legs went from under me and I started shaking. \"I put it quietly in my pocket. We left the beach and half-way home, we pulled over for a drink.\" The Folkestone Digs project is part of the town's arts festival which has included work by artists including Tracey Emin, Jeremy Deller and Martin Creed in previous years. Artists including Yoko Ono are taking part in this year's festival which runs until November 2. Mr Wood said the couple first thought they might sell the gold straight away and go on holiday to Paris. \"Now we're thinking we might keep hold of it because of all the interest,\" he said. \"We are not going to rush into anything.\" Curator Lewis Biggs said the beach had been full since it was announced on Thursday the gold had been buried. \"There are always people digging on the beach but there's a lot more digging on the beach now,\" he said. \"When it's at high tide there are maybe 50 people, when it's low tide maybe 1,000. \"There are a lot of people coming and going of all ages - families, dedicated people with metal detectors, people with lights on their heads all night. \"It's been fun down there.\" It is not known how many other people may have found the gold bars. \"What you find is yours and you can tell other people or not,\" said Mr Biggs. \"You can stick it in your sock and take it home so we will never know if they have all been found or not.\"",

    "prompt": "A new method of delivering data, which uses the visible spectrum rather than radio waves, has been tested in a working office.",
    "HWT": "Li-fi can deliver internet access 100 times faster than traditional wi-fi, offering speeds of up to 1Gbps (gigabit per second). It requires a light source, such as a standard LED bulb, an internet connection and a photo detector. It was tested this week by Estonian start-up Velmenni, in Tallinn. Velmenni used a li-fi-enabled light bulb to transmit data at speeds of 1Gbps. Laboratory tests have shown theoretical speeds of up to 224Gbps. It was tested in an office, to allow workers to access the internet and in an industrial space, where it provided a smart lighting solution. Speaking to the International Business Times, chief executive Deepak Solanki said that the technology could reach consumers \"within three to four years\". The term li-fi was first coined by Prof Harald Haas from Edinburgh University, who demonstrated the technology at a Ted (Technology, Entertainment and Design) conference in 2011. His talk, which has now been watched nearly two million times, showed an LED lamp streaming video. Prof Haas described a future when billions of light bulbs could become wireless hotspots. One of the big advantages of li-fi is the fact that, unlike wi-fi,  it does not interfere with other radio signals, so could be utilised on aircraft and in other places where interference is an issue. While the spectrum for radio waves is in short supply, the visible light spectrum is 10,000 times larger, meaning it is unlikely to run out any time soon. But the technology also has its drawbacks - most notably the fact that it cannot be deployed outdoors in direct sunlight, because that would interfere with its signal. Neither can the technology travel through walls so initial use is likely to be limited to places where it can be used to supplement wi-fi networks, such as in congested urban areas or places where wi-fi is not safe, such as hospitals.",
    "MGT": "In a groundbreaking experiment conducted in a bustling office environment, researchers have successfully tested a new method of data transmission that uses the visible light spectrum, rather than traditional radio waves. This innovative approach, known as Li-Fi (Light Fidelity), promises to revolutionize the way data is transmitted, offering faster speeds and enhanced security.\n\nThe experiment, conducted in a real-world office setting, demonstrated the practicality and efficiency of Li-Fi technology in everyday environments. By leveraging the ubiquitous presence of LED lighting, Li-Fi can transmit data at speeds that surpass conventional Wi-Fi. The technology works by modulating light beams at frequencies imperceptible to the human eye, allowing for high-speed data transfer without any interference with existing radio-based communication systems.\n\nOne of the key advantages of Li-Fi is its potential for increased bandwidth. Radio waves, which are limited in frequency, can become congested in densely populated areas. In contrast, the visible light spectrum offers a far greater range of frequencies, allowing for significantly higher data transfer rates. This makes Li-Fi an attractive option for environments where data demand is high, such as offices, airports, and urban centers.\n\nSecurity is another significant benefit of Li-Fi. Since light cannot penetrate through walls, the data transmission is confined to the physical space illuminated by the light source. This containment reduces the risk of data interception, providing a more secure alternative to traditional wireless communication methods.\n\nDuring the office trial, employees experienced seamless connectivity while engaging in routine tasks such as video conferencing, file transfers, and internet browsing. The system was integrated into the office’s existing LED lighting infrastructure, requiring minimal modifications. This ease of integration highlights Li-Fi's potential for widespread adoption, as it can be implemented without the need for extensive overhauls of current lighting systems.\n\nDespite its promising advantages, Li-Fi does have limitations. Its reliance on light means that it cannot penetrate through opaque surfaces, limiting its range to the illuminated area. Additionally, any obstruction between the light source and the receiver can disrupt the data connection. However, these challenges are being addressed through ongoing research and development, with the aim of enhancing the technology's robustness and reliability.\n\nThe successful office trial marks a significant milestone in the development of Li-Fi technology. As researchers continue to refine and expand its capabilities, Li-Fi is poised to become a viable alternative to Wi-Fi, offering faster, more secure, and more efficient data transmission in a variety of settings. With its potential to alleviate the growing demand for wireless connectivity, Li-Fi represents a promising frontier in the evolution of communication technology.",

    "prompt": "The latest weather data suggest that the Earth's average temperature is close to breaking the record set in 2010.",
    "HWT": "Even more striking is the fact that if this occurs, then fourteen out of fifteen of the warmest years on record will have occurred since the turn of the century. However, while record-breaking warmth is consistent with the general trend of global warming, it's not always the case that each year is warmer than the previous one. There are temporary ups and downs that ride on top of the overall warming trend. It's quite possible for a few years to elapse before the next record year, and the warming can speed up or slow down for runs of years, as happened for example in the slowdown of warming since the end of the last century. So what makes one year warmer or colder than its predecessor? The answer to this depends on a number of factors. Large volcanic eruptions can cause a temporary dip in temperatures for a few years due to reflection of sunlight by the resulting atmospheric particles. This happened following the eruption of Mt Pinatubo in 1991, for example. Fluctuations in the ocean can also cause temporary ups and downs, and the massive heat release during an El Nino event in the tropics can temporarily raise global temperatures, such as occurred in 1998. This year, the tropical ocean has indeed warmed up in both the Pacific and the Atlantic but both of these ocean basins have also been very warm in northern latitudes, compounding the effect on global temperature. While the oceans exhibit record warmth, it is the average temperature over land regions and in the Arctic that has risen most. It is worth noting that this is consistent with predictions from computer models of climate change, which have suggested for many years that warming over land, and over the Arctic, will outstrip the increase in global average temperature as climate change progresses. The WMO report highlights a number of record-breaking weather events around the world:",
    "MGT": "The latest weather data have revealed that Earth's average temperature is nearing a new high, coming close to surpassing the record set in 2010. As climate scientists continue to monitor global temperatures closely, this development underscores the ongoing challenges posed by climate change.\n\nAccording to recent reports from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the current data indicate that average global temperatures are only fractions of a degree below the peak reached in 2010. This marks a concerning trend, as it reflects a consistent pattern of rising temperatures over the past decade. The data were compiled using advanced satellite measurements, buoy readings, and ocean temperature records, providing a comprehensive overview of global climate conditions.\n\nThe implications of these findings are significant. The close approach to the 2010 record highlights the urgent need for global efforts to address climate change. Scientists warn that such temperature increases can lead to more extreme weather events, including heatwaves, intense storms, and flooding. These events have the potential to disrupt ecosystems, economies, and communities worldwide.\n\nIn particular, polar regions are experiencing accelerated ice melt, contributing to rising sea levels that threaten coastal cities. Additionally, warmer temperatures are affecting biodiversity, with many species struggling to adapt to the rapid changes in their habitats. The agricultural sector is also facing challenges as changing weather patterns impact crop yields and food security.\n\nEnvironmental organizations and advocates are calling for immediate action to mitigate these effects.

After a two-and-a-half hour delay, Williams converted a fifth match point to win 6-4 7-6 (12-10) in Paris. The American, 34, aiming for her 22nd Grand Slam title, was joined in the next round by older sister Venus. Venus's match against France's Alize Cornet was stopped at 2-1 because of the rain but the 35-year-old came back to seal a hard-fought 7-6 1-6 6-0 win. Serena had dropped just five games in her first two matches at Roland Garros, but faced a tougher test against the French number one. Each player held their serve in the opening set until Williams edged ahead in the 10th game by taking her third break point. Neither could gain an advantage in the second set, with Mladenovic thumping down an ace in the rain to set up a tie-breaker. When the match finally resumed on Court Philippe Chatrier, Mladenovic led 5-3 in the decider - and spurned a set point at 9-8 - before two wayward forehands saw Williams through. \"It was very difficult, she played really, really well,\" Serena said. \"She forced me to bring out my best tennis.\" She will play in the fourth round against Ukraine's 18th seed Elina Svitolina, who won 6-4 6-4 against 2008 champion Ana Ivanovic.

    "HWT": "The Celtic midfielder spent the second half of last season on loan at the Dons, scoring seven goals in 15 games. But he admits to being unsure about a return until manager McInnes turned down the chance to join English Championship club Sunderland. \"As soon as I heard that, my mind was made up to come back,\" Christie said. The 22-year-old was invited back to Aberdeen as part of the deal that took Jonny Hayes to Celtic for £1.3m. Sunderland's move for McInnes, to replace David Moyes, caused Christie a few moments of concern as he enjoyed his summer holiday. McInnes decided against a switch to Wearside to stay with the club he guided to second place in the Scottish Premiership and runners-up in both domestic cup competitions last term. That delighted Christie on a personal level and he also believes it was a significant moment for the whole of Scottish football. \"It came out in the press that I would be coming back, but I was still on holiday lying on a beach,\" Christie told Red TV. \"I hadn't had a phone call, so I didn't know what was going on. \"When I came back, things had got into motion, but understandably I didn't want to make a decision until I knew the gaffer was staying. \"When the news broke that he was going to stay, it was a shock to a lot of people in Scottish football, but it's brilliant news. \"Not just for the club, as it is a huge lift, but also for the whole of Scottish football. \"For a few years there it turned out to be that as soon as there was any offer from England, people would jump ship. So it's credit to the manager that he has stayed here. \"He called me the next day to say he had made his mind up to stay at Aberdeen and wanted to have me on board.\"",

His performances have been marked by creativity, vision, and a knack for scoring crucial goals. The 24-year-old has contributed significantly to the team’s domestic campaign, providing the much-needed spark in the midfield.\n\nIn an interview, Christie reflected on his time at Aberdeen, praising McInnes for the positive impact he has had on the team. “When Derek decided to stay, it really made my decision easier,” Christie said. “From day one, he’s been fantastic, helping me settle in and grow. His approach to the game and leadership have been inspiring. I’m really happy to continue working under him.”\n\nMcInnes, known for his tactical acumen and ability to maximize player potential, has praised Christie for his professionalism and commitment. The manager’s decision to stay at Aberdeen reassured Christie about the club’s ambitions and the project’s continuity. This consistency has been crucial for players on loan, providing them with a stable environment to develop and showcase their abilities.\n\nAberdeen’s decision to extend Christie’s loan reflects their satisfaction with his contributions and their belief in his continued impact on the team. The club has been enjoying a successful season, competing strongly in both domestic cup competitions and the league. Christie’s creativity and technical skills have added depth to the squad, enhancing their attacking prowess.\n\nChristie’s journey from Celtic to Aberdeen has been a testament to his adaptability and determination. The midfielder, who has experienced the highs and lows of professional football, appreciates the opportunity to prove himself at a club like Aberdeen.

    "prompt": "Growth in UK house prices slowed in the year to July, the country's largest mortgage lender has said, although they are still rising \"robustly\".",
    "HWT": "The Halifax said that prices rose at an annual pace of 7.9% last month - down from 9.6% in June. During July itself, prices actually fell, by 0.6%, the largest monthly drop since April 2014. It brings the average price of a flat or house across the country back down to Â£198,883. The sharp fall in July was described as \"a correction\" by Howard Archer, chief UK economist with IHS Global Insight, following a 1.6% rise in prices in June. The Halifax figures are in contrast to those from rival lender Nationwide, which said earlier this week that the rate of house price growth picked up to 3.5% in July, from 3.3% a month earlier. However, the Halifax said it expected strong growth in prices for the rest of the year. \"The underlying pace of house price growth remains robust notwithstanding the easing in July,\" said Stephen Noakes, Halifax's managing director of retail customer products. \"Continuing economic recovery, earnings growth in excess of consumer price inflation, and very low mortgage rates all underpin housing demand.\" Mr Archer said the contrasting figures from the Halifax and Nationwide served as a warning against reading too much into any one survey. \"This highlights the need to not pin too much weight on one particular house price survey or measure, but to try and take an overall view from the data,\" he said. Nationwide and Halifax both base their data on mortgage approvals, but they use a different \"mix-adjustment\" in their methodology. That involves a different weighting of the figures, to reflect different types of property being sold in any month, and more sales in a particular region of the UK.",
    "MGT": "The latest report from the UK's largest mortgage lender indicates a slowdown in the growth of house prices over the year to July. Despite this deceleration, prices continue to rise robustly, reflecting ongoing demand within the housing market.\n\nAccording to the lender's data, the increase in house prices has moderated compared to previous months, suggesting a potential shift in market dynamics. Analysts attribute this slowdown to a combination of factors, including rising interest rates, increased cost of living, and a cooling in buyer sentiment amidst economic uncertainties. These elements have contributed to a more cautious approach from potential homebuyers, leading to a tempered pace of price growth.\n\nDespite these challenges, the housing market remains resilient, with prices continuing to increase. This robust upward trend is supported by a persistent shortage of housing supply, which continues to exert upward pressure on prices. The mismatch between supply and demand remains a significant factor driving price increases, as new housing developments struggle to keep pace with the needs of the market.\n\nRegional variations have also been observed, with some areas experiencing more pronounced slowdowns than others. Urban centers and regions with high demand for property have seen a more substantial moderation in price growth, while rural and less densely populated areas have maintained stronger price increases.\n\nIndustry experts caution that while the current slowdown may signal a more balanced market, the housing sector remains vulnerable to broader economic factors. The ongoing impact of inflation, potential changes in government housing policies, and shifts in consumer confidence are all variables that could influence future trends.\n\nHomebuyers and investors are advised to remain vigilant, keeping a close eye on market conditions and economic indicators. For those in the market, the current environment presents both challenges and opportunities, with the potential for strategic investments in areas less affected by the slowdown.\n\nIn summary, while the growth in UK house prices has slowed, the market continues to exhibit strong price increases, driven by underlying demand and supply constraints. The future trajectory will likely depend on a range of economic factors and policy decisions, making it essential for stakeholders to stay informed and adaptable.",

    "HWT": "The head of police, Alberto Jorge Aracena, said many of the bodies had been badly burnt. He said fighting broke out early on Friday between inmates at the maximum security area of the Palmasola jail in the city of Santa Cruz. \"There was a fight for control in two cellblocks in the prison,\" said Mr Aracena. He said prisoners in one of the blocks had blown up a metal propane tank in another block around dawn. Local media reported that shots had been heard after the explosion. A fire that broke out shortly afterwards took almost two hours to put out. Mr Aracena said the authorities had brought the situation under control. Another government official, Celso Parada, said the gas explosion had caused many injuries. \"I saw some 60 injured inmates. Some of them were badly burnt,\" he said. Mr Parada said the death toll could eventually be much higher. He also said he had seen the charred body of a small boy. Prisons in Bolivia are often overcrowded, but not only with adults. Hundreds of children live in them while their parents serve their sentences. Under the country's legislation, children under six years are allowed to stay in their parents' cells. But many remain there even longer, as there is nowhere else for them to go. President Evo Morales expressed \"dismay\" over the deaths, ordering an urgent investigation.",

The association marked the anniversary of the Croke Park stadium attack before Saturday's International Rules test between Ireland and Australia.

    "prompt": "Influential R&B singer songwriter Don Covay, whose songs were performed by the Rolling Stones, Otis Redding and Aretha Franklin, has died aged 76.",
    "HWT": "His daughter, Ursula, confirmed the singer's death to The Washington Post. He died in a New York hospital earlier this week from complications following a stroke. Covay gave Aretha Franklin one of her biggest hits with Chain of Fools in 1968, a song he had written 15 years earlier. His singing style also influenced Mick Jagger, as seen in the Rolling Stones cover of his song Mercy Mercy. Covay started out in music in a gospel group with his siblings at school, before joining doo-wop group Rainbows. While trying to make it as a solo artist and singer-songwriter he spent time as Little Richard's chauffeur and warm-up act. His first chart hit came in 1961 with Pony Time. The track, however, became an even bigger hit when Chubby Checker recorded his own version a year later in 1962, topping the pop and R&B charts. This pattern continued with his song Mercy Mercy, which he recorded in 1964 with a then-unknown Jimi Hendrix on guitar, which went into the top 40. A year later the Rolling Stones recorded their own version for their album Out of Our Heads, causing many to point out the similarity in singing styles between Jagger and Covay. While working as a songwriter at the Brill Building in New York, Covay wrote for artists including Gladys Knight and the Pips, Wilson Pickett and Solomon Burke. He was also part of the short-lived group the Soul Clan which featured Burke, Joe Tex, Ben E King and Arthur Conley. His work has been covered by a wide variety of artists including Gene Vincent, Connie Francis, Steppenwolf, Bobby Womack and the Small Faces. Covay suffered a stroke in 1992 and a year later stars including Ronnie Wood, Iggy Pop and Todd Rundgren produced a tribute album entitled Back to the Streets: Celebrating the Music of Don Covay. After a gap of 23 years Covay released his last album Ad Lib in 2000, which featured Rolling Stones guitarists Ronnie Woods and Keith Richards, Bad Company vocalist Paul Rodgers, Wilson Pickett, Syl Johnson and Huey Lewis.",

    "HWT": "David Craig Ellis, 41, has admitted killing Alec Warburton, 59, at a house in Sketty, Swansea, but denies murder. Swansea Crown Court has heard that unemployed Mr Ellis could not afford his rent and Mr Warburton suggested \"things of a sexual nature\" instead. Mr Ellis told the jury his experience of being sexually abused as a child had triggered the fatal attack. Mr Ellis said his landlord had \"barged\" into his bedroom and reminded him his rent was in arrears. Mr Ellis said he felt angry due to the suggestion he could give sexual favours in lieu of rent and he tried to punch Mr Warburton after he cupped his face. \"I was abused as a child. The height difference made me feel like a child again,\" said Mr Ellis. He said he picked up a screwdriver and tried to stab Mr Warburton but the attempt was unsuccessful. The jury was told Mr Ellis eventually managed to kick his landlord in the groin causing him to drop to one knee. Christopher Clee QC, prosecuting, said: \"At that stage he was of no threat to you at all, was he?\" Mr Ellis replied: \"I don't know what I was thinking at the time.\" The court then heard how Mr Ellis picked up a hammer and struck Mr Warburton on the back of the head. Mr Clee asked Mr Ellis: \"You hit him from behind with such force you made a hole in his skull, didn't you?\" He replied: \"Yes.\" Mr Clee added: \"You caved that man's head skull in - what were you doing?\" Mr Ellis said: \" I don't know, I lost control.\" The trial continues.",

As the trial progressed, the defendant provided a disturbing account of the events leading up to the murder. He testified that on the night in question, his landlord had made an unwelcome request for sexual favors, which he described as deeply offensive and humiliating.\n\nAccording to the defendant, the request triggered a violent outburst, during which he \"lost control.\" He admitted to attacking the landlord, resulting in fatal injuries. The defense argued that while this does not excuse his actions, it provides context for his loss of composure in the heat of the moment.\n\nProsecutors, however, presented a strong case, emphasizing the brutality of the attack and the premeditated nature of the crime.
