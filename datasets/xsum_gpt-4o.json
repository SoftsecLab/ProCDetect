    "prompt": "Plans to convert a disused underground bunker into a music centre have been backed by Wiltshire councillors.",
    "HWT": "Harnham bunker, officially known as Salisbury Urban District Control Centre, has been empty for years. Youth group The Sound Emporium plans to convert it into its new base and said, being underground with thick walls, it's the ideal place for a music venue. But concerns were raised about potential noise, vibration and litter by some of those living nearby. Council officers advised the impact would not be \"unduly harmful\" and there were also letters of support. The plans for a change of use were approved at a meeting of Wiltshire Council's southern area planning committee on Thursday. Ross Sanderson, of the Sound Emporium, told the BBC the venue was \"unique\" and \"inspiring\". \"What better place to have a music venue than underground, with the natural soundproofing of the earth plus between 5ft-10ft thick concrete walls?\" Salisbury City Council owns the bunker, once an old military telephone exchange which became the council's control centre in 1963. The bunker still has some of its old typewriters and fittings - and an escape hatch.",
    "MGT": "Wiltshire councillors have expressed support for an ambitious plan to transform a disused underground bunker into a vibrant music centre. The proposal, which has gained traction in recent weeks, aims to breathe new life into the abandoned site by turning it into a creative hub for musicians and artists.\n\nThe bunker, originally built during the Cold War era, has remained unused for decades. Advocates for the project believe its unique design and acoustics make it an ideal location for a state-of-the-art music centre. The facility is expected to include recording studios, rehearsal spaces, and performance areas, offering local musicians and bands a much-needed venue to hone their craft.\n\nResidents and community groups have largely welcomed the initiative, citing its potential to boost the local economy and invigorate Wiltshire’s cultural scene. Supporters also emphasize the importance of repurposing abandoned structures to preserve historical significance while serving modern needs.\n\nCouncillors praised the innovative vision behind the plan and highlighted its alignment with the region’s goals of fostering arts and culture. While funding and logistical details are still under discussion, the project has taken a significant step forward with the council’s endorsement. If realized, the music centre could become a cornerstone of Wiltshire’s creative community."

    "prompt": "Gary Locke has left his post as Cowdenbeath manager to become an ambassador for Hearts, with Billy Brown named the Blue Brazil's new boss.",
    "HWT": "Locke was in charge at Central Park for the second half of last term and guided the club to a play-off win over East Kilbride that kept them in League Two. Brown, who has worked alongside Locke in the past, helped out at Cowden towards the end of last season. The club say their aim remains to secure promotion next season. Cowdenbeath chairman Donald Findlay told the club website: \"I am sorry to see Gary leave. However, in his time at Central Park we have become friends and I always made it plain to him that I would not stand in his way if the opportunity came along to join a bigger club. \"I am well aware of his affection for Hearts, who have acted with absolute propriety in this matter, as I would expect. I will always be grateful for what he and Billy Brown did for the club at the end of the season and I have every confidence that Billy will carry on the good work.\" Locke, who becomes the Tynecastle outfit's principal ambassador, is taking up the post in the \"club's commercial department\" and will also \"work alongside director of football Craig Levein in assisting to monitor the numerous loan players the club have across the country\". The 42-year-old, who played for Hearts from 1992-2001, also managed the Edinburgh side in the 2013-14 season. Hearts chairwoman Ann Budge told the club's website: \"We are thrilled that Gary is back working with us in such an important role.\"",
    "MGT": "Gary Locke has stepped down from his role as manager of Cowdenbeath to embark on a new journey as an ambassador for Heart of Midlothian. Locke, who has been at the helm of Cowdenbeath, affectionately known as the Blue Brazil, has decided to make this career transition to rejoin Hearts, a club where he holds a significant legacy.\n\nDuring his tenure with Cowdenbeath, Locke was admired for his dedication and leadership. His departure marks the end of a chapter for the club, but it also opens a new opportunity for him to foster relationships and promote the values of Heart of Midlothian in his ambassadorial role. This new position is seen as a strategic move by Hearts to strengthen their community ties and enhance their brand presence, with Locke’s deep-rooted connection to the club playing a pivotal role.\n\nFollowing Locke's departure, Cowdenbeath acted swiftly to appoint Billy Brown as the new manager. Brown, who brings a wealth of experience and knowledge to the team, is no stranger to the pressures of Scottish football. With a reputation for nurturing talent and a keen tactical mind, Brown’s appointment has been well-received, with fans and players alike eager to see how his leadership will shape the future of the club.\n\nBrown’s immediate focus will be on stabilizing the team's performance and instilling a fresh sense of purpose and ambition. As Cowdenbeath looks to the future under Brown's guidance, Gary Locke's legacy will remain a cherished part of the club's history. Meanwhile, his new role at Hearts is anticipated to usher in a period of renewed engagement and support for the Edinburgh club."

    "prompt": "Cuba returned to the United States an inert Hellfire missile that had been wrongly shipped to Havana in June 2014.",
    "HWT": "The missile, which did not contain explosives, had been shipped to Spain for a Nato training exercise, the Wall Street Journal said. It was then taken to Germany and eventually to Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris for onward delivery to Florida. It was instead loaded on to an Air France flight to Havana. The incident could have led to a serious loss of military technology, officials told the Wall Street Journal. The whole affair has been embarrassing for the Americans, who have had to ask the Cubans if they could have their highly sensitive missile back, says the BBC's Will Grant in Havana. The missile arrived on a flight from Paris \"by mistake or mishandling in the country of origin,\" said a Cuban Foreign Ministry statement. \"Cuba acted with seriousness and transparency and co-operated to find a satisfactory solution to this issue,\" it added. The AGM 114 Hellfire is a laser-guided missile that can be deployed from an attack helicopter or an unmanned drone. US officials were worried that Cuba could share the advanced technology inside the missile with countries such as North Korea, China or Russia, sources close to the investigation told the Wall Street Journal. The US and Cuba, old Cold War enemies, restored diplomatic relations in July last year after more than 50 years. The two countries have been working to rebuild their economic and trade ties. An announcement is expected on Tuesday about the reinstatement of scores of commercial flights between US cities and Havana.",
    "MGT": "In an unusual turn of events, Cuba has returned a U.S. Hellfire missile that was mistakenly shipped to Havana nearly nine years ago. The inert missile, which was used for training purposes and contained no explosive material, had been misrouted to the island nation in June 2014, raising concerns about sensitive military technology falling into unintended hands.\n\nThe incident reportedly occurred during a routine shipment of U.S. military equipment. The Hellfire missile, designed for precision strikes, was intended for a NATO training exercise in Europe but somehow ended up in Cuba. How the error occurred has not been publicly disclosed, but it immediately sparked alarm within U.S. defense and intelligence circles, as the weapon’s technology could have been studied or reverse-engineered.\n\nCuban officials, however, maintained possession of the inert missile without exploiting its technology, according to U.S. sources familiar with the matter. The Cuban government quietly returned the missile to the United States, resolving a sensitive issue that had lingered for years. The Pentagon has since implemented stricter oversight measures to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future.\n\nThe return of the missile is seen as a rare moment of cooperation between the two countries, which have had strained relations for decades. Analysts have noted that Cuba’s decision to return the missile intact may have been a gesture aimed at avoiding further political tension with Washington.\n\nWhile the error has been resolved, the mishap remains a glaring reminder of the logistical challenges that can arise in the handling of advanced military equipment. The U.S. government has not disclosed the exact details of how the missile was recovered but has expressed relief that the matter has been concluded without further complications."

    "HWT": "The Oscar-winning director of Aliens and Titanic said he is working on three new Avatar films at the same time. The first film was supposed to be out in December 2016, but Cameron said writing the stories had become \"very involved\". \"There's a layer of complexity in getting the story to work as a saga across three films,\" he explained. Cameron said the goal was to have the scripts for the three movies completed by the end of this month so that filming can begin. \"We're writing three simultaneously and we've done that so that everything tracks throughout the three films,\" he told the Associated Press. \"We're not just going to do one and then make up another one and another one after that. \"And parallel with that, we're doing all the design. So we've designed all the creatures and the environments.\" Cameron said he thought it was important that each film linked forward to the next one in a satisfying way, but also came to a resolution that did not leave the audience hanging. The three films will be shot in New Zealand, where some of the original film was also made. Avatar is the highest-grossing film in history, with box office takings of almost $2.8 billion (Â£1.8 billion). Set in the 22nd Century on a distant planet inhabited by a humanoid race, the sci-fi epic went on to win three Oscars. Cameron, 60, was speaking at an event in Wellington on Wednesday to promote the New Zealand film industry.",
    "MGT": "The highly anticipated sequel to James Cameron's 2009 blockbuster \"Avatar\" has been delayed, with its release now slated for 2017. The announcement was made by Cameron, who shared the news with fans eager to return to the lush, otherworldly landscapes of Pandora. Originally expected to hit theaters in 2016, the filmmaker explained that the delay was necessary to accommodate the ambitious scope of the project, which includes two additional sequels set to follow the second installment.\n\nCameron, renowned for his meticulous approach to storytelling and groundbreaking visuals, revealed that the complexity of developing three interconnected films simultaneously has posed unique challenges. \"We’re writing all three at the same time, and we’ve done that so that everything interconnects across the trilogy,\" he said. \"It’s a big job.\" The decision to release multiple sequels was driven by the immense success of the original \"Avatar,\" which remains the highest-grossing film of all time, earning over $2.8 billion at the global box office.\n\nFans of the franchise have been eagerly awaiting the continuation of the story, which is expected to delve deeper into the mythology of Pandora and introduce new characters and locations. Cameron promised that the sequels will push the boundaries of filmmaking and visual effects, much like the original film did with its revolutionary use of 3D and motion capture technology.\n\nWhile the delay may come as a disappointment to fans, many are optimistic that Cameron’s commitment to quality will ensure a cinematic experience worth the wait. As the filmmaker continues to refine his vision, audiences worldwide remain captivated by the promise of returning to the enchanting world of \"Avatar\" and exploring the next chapter of its epic tale."

    "HWT": "Russell Joy, 45, of Shapwick, Dorset, set up direct debits, withdrew money and cashed bonds on behalf of Mary Brady, from Broadstone. Bournemouth Crown Court heard Joy won the trust of the pensioner, who died earlier this month, when she hired him as her gardener in 2008. He was entrusted to withdraw money for her daily living expenses. In December 2014 he made the first of 107 withdrawals without her knowledge, totalling £32,100. The following November Ms Brady cashed five bonds in the sum of £230,000 and wrote Joy a cheque for £100,000. In March 2016, he received a further £20,000 cheque. He also withdrew money to buy a Land Rover car and set up a direct debit to pay his vehicle insurance. The offences came to light when the pensioner's relatives checked her finances while she was in hospital. In a statement, Ms Brady's family said they were \"desperately sad\" about the \"ugly end\" to her life. Det Insp Andy Dilworth said: \"Russell Joy is nothing more than a callous fraudster. He befriended his victim over a period of many years and quickly earned her trust.\" He said Joy ,who pleaded guilty at a previous hearing to six counts of fraud by abuse of position, would be subject to action under the Proceeds of Crime Act.",

The perpetrator, who formed a friendship with the elderly woman, exploited her trust over an extended period, siphoning off her life savings.\n\nThe court heard how the man manipulated the victim, who lived alone and relied on him for companionship and assistance. Under the guise of helping her manage her finances, he systematically drained her accounts, leaving her in a precarious financial situation. Prosecutors described his actions as \"calculated and callous,\" highlighting the emotional and financial toll on the victim, who had placed her full confidence in him.\n\nThe fraud came to light when suspicious transactions were flagged by the woman's bank, prompting an investigation. Authorities uncovered a pattern of deceit, with the man using the stolen funds to finance a lavish lifestyle. During the trial, it was revealed that he had no intention of repaying the money and showed little remorse for his actions.\n\nThe judge condemned the man's betrayal, emphasizing the vulnerability of the victim and the breach of trust involved. In delivering the sentence, the judge stated that such predatory behavior deserved a significant punishment to serve as a deterrent.\n\nThe victim's family expressed relief that justice had been served but noted the lingering emotional impact on their loved one. Advocacy groups have called for stronger protections for the elderly to prevent similar cases of financial exploitation in the future."

    "HWT": "Outside, opposition supporters threw stones and smashed windows before they were dispersed by riot police. Protesters have been trying to disrupt parliament over an EU-brokered deal to improve relations with Serbia. Kosovo unilaterally declared its independence from Serbia in 2008. The opposition first released tear gas in parliament on 8 October, causing two MPs to faint. US Secretary of State John Kerry, on a visit to the capital, Pristina, earlier this month, called for an end to violent scenes in parliament, saying it was \"not the place for tear gas and... not the place for intimidation\". However, opposition MPs released gas canisters again in the parliamentary chamber on Monday, forcing a suspension of proceedings. A large group of plainclothes police officers donned gas masks as the chamber was cleared. One of the MPs who released the gas, Glauk Konjufca, said it was \"a collective action by the opposition\". \"Others have done this too, and we will continue to do this in the future. Our breaching of the law is nothing compared to the damage that is being done by these agreements.\" The opposition is particularly opposed to a deal to give more autonomy to Kosovo's ethnic Serb minority, which they say could increase Serbia's influence. The vote on next year's €1.67bn (£1.1bn) budget resumed in a side room, with only MPs from the governing coalition present and was approved, Reuters news agency reported. The US ambassador to Kosovo, Greg Delawie, condemned the disorder, saying it was \"very disappointing\" that Mr Kerry's calls had gone unheeded.",
    "MGT": "Opposition lawmakers in Kosovo have once again disrupted parliamentary proceedings by releasing tear gas inside the chamber. The incident marks the sixth time in just over two months that opposition MPs have resorted to such tactics, reflecting deep divisions over the government’s policies. The latest protest occurred during a session scheduled to vote on the 2016 budget, forcing lawmakers and staff to evacuate the chamber.\n\nThe opposition has been fiercely critical of recent agreements brokered by the government with Serbia and Montenegro. They argue that these deals undermine Kosovo's sovereignty and territorial integrity. Among the points of contention is a European Union-mediated agreement granting greater autonomy to Serb-majority municipalities within Kosovo. Opposition MPs contend that this move threatens to deepen ethnic divisions and weaken the country's governance.\n\nAnother issue fueling tensions is a border demarcation agreement with Montenegro, which the opposition claims cedes Kosovo territory. These concerns have led to repeated disruptions in parliament, with opposition leaders vowing to continue their protests until the government abandons the agreements. Tear gas has become their method of choice to block proceedings, drawing condemnation from government officials and international observers.\n\nPrime Minister Isa Mustafa has criticized the opposition's tactics, describing them as harmful to democracy and the rule of law. He has urged lawmakers to engage in dialogue rather than resort to radical measures. However, opposition leaders remain defiant, accusing the government of betraying national interests.\n\nThe ongoing unrest has raised concerns about Kosovo's political stability, with international stakeholders calling for calm and constructive dialogue. As the country grapples with these internal divisions, the repeated use of tear gas in parliament underscores the intensity of the political deadlock and the challenges facing its young democracy."

    "prompt": "Manufacturing sales from Northern Ireland were worth £13.3bn last year, the highest value on record.",
    "HWT": "External sales were up by 3.2% over the year, a rise of £415m. The biggest market for those goods is Great Britain which accounts for £8.1bn - just under half the total value. The Republic of Ireland is the next single biggest market at £1.3bn, followed by the rest of the EU at £1.2bn. Sales to all other parts of the world were £2.6bn. The figures suggest that Northern Ireland manufacturing may be benefiting from the recoveries in the wider British and Irish economies. Sales to GB were up by 6.2% while sales to the Republic of Ireland were up by 5.3%. However sales to other EU countries fell by 13%. The figures are produced by the  Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency (NISRA). Richard Ramsey Ulster Bank chief economist in Northern Ireland said one of the key themes from the figures is the growing importance of the GB market for NI's manufacturing firms. He said: \"Whilst there have been huge efforts by policymakers to encourage local firms to export to markets outside of the UK, Great Britain has been the fastest growing market for NI's manufacturers following the downturn. \"Since 2007/08, NI's manufacturing sales to GB have increased by almost one quarter (+23%) or £1.5bn. \"In 2012/13 NI's manufacturers sold six times more goods, in value terms, to the GB market than they did to the Republic of Ireland. \"Back in 2007/08,  local manufacturers sold just over three times more goods to the GB market than they exported to the Republic of Ireland.\"",
    "MGT": "Manufacturing sales in Northern Ireland reached an unprecedented milestone last year, with total sales valued at £13.3 billion—the highest figure ever recorded. The data highlights the resilience and growth within the region's manufacturing sector, which continues to play a pivotal role in driving economic activity and supporting local communities.\n\nThe record-breaking figure underscores the strength of Northern Ireland’s manufacturing industries amidst a challenging global economic environment. Despite pressures such as rising costs, supply chain disruptions, and broader uncertainties, the sector has demonstrated remarkable adaptability and innovation. Key contributors to the surge in sales include advanced engineering, food and beverage production, and pharmaceutical manufacturing, all of which have proven integral to sustaining the upward trajectory.\n\nExperts believe that the sector’s success is deeply tied to Northern Ireland’s ability to leverage its skilled workforce, embrace cutting-edge technologies, and capitalize on export opportunities. International demand for high-quality goods produced in the region has continued to grow, further bolstering revenue streams. Local manufacturers have also benefited from strategic investments in infrastructure and government initiatives designed to foster growth and competitiveness.\n\nThe milestone is viewed as a significant achievement for Northern Ireland’s economy, providing a much-needed boost as other sectors face ongoing challenges. It also underscores the importance of continued support for manufacturing businesses to ensure they can sustain this momentum in the years ahead.\n\nWhile the record-breaking sales figures are a cause for celebration, industry leaders have cautioned against complacency. They have emphasized the need for ongoing investment in skills development, innovation, and sustainability to safeguard the sector’s long-term success. As Northern Ireland’s manufacturing sector moves forward, its ability to adapt and thrive in a rapidly changing global landscape will remain crucial in shaping the region’s economic future."

It is updating its National Flood Risk Assessment which informs members of the public and local authorities about the likelihood of flooding. The Environment Agency grades coastal areas at risk of flooding from very low to high. Environment Agency flood risks: High: Greater than one in 30 chance in any given year Medium: One in 30 to one in 200 chance in any given year Low: One in 200 to one in 1000 chance in any given year Very low: Less than one in 1,000 chance in any given year Last winter massive storms hit the South West coast with waves up to 15m (50ft) high, destroying part of the main railway line out of the region at Dawlish. Marcus Salmon, planning liaison technical specialist with the agency, said: \"The storms have definitely reflected areas where our maps are not as representative as they can be. \"That is something that we are working to address as quickly as possible. \"Last winter's storms showed the susceptibility of our coastal communities and infrastructure to flooding and erosion. \"The challenges presented by flooding and coastal erosion are expected to become more acute as a result of climate change, due to a combination of sea level rise, increased storminess and increased wave heights. \"So as to better understand the risks we are updating the National Flood Risk Assessment to take account of wave, wind and storm surge which are underrepresented in our current mapping.\"",

This move comes as climate change continues to pose significant threats to coastal regions, with predictions of more frequent and severe weather events.\n\nThe review aims to assess the vulnerability of various coastal areas to flooding, considering factors such as wave height, tidal patterns, and existing flood defenses. The Environment Agency plans to use advanced modeling techniques and historical data to identify regions most at risk and recommend necessary improvements to infrastructure.\n\nFlooding has long been a concern for communities along the English coast, with many areas experiencing devastating impacts in recent years. The agency's decision to review flood risks is part of a broader strategy to enhance resilience against climate-related challenges. By understanding the dynamics of high waves and their potential for causing coastal flooding, the agency hopes to develop targeted interventions that can protect homes, businesses, and natural habitats.\n\nThe review process will involve collaboration with local authorities, environmental experts, and community leaders to ensure a comprehensive approach. Public consultations are also expected to take place, allowing residents to voice their concerns and contribute to the development of effective flood management strategies.\n\nAs the Environment Agency embarks on this critical task, there is a growing recognition of the need for proactive measures to safeguard coastal communities. The review is not only a response to immediate threats but also a step towards long-term planning and adaptation to the challenges posed by climate change.\n\nUltimately, the findings of the review will inform policy decisions, guiding investments in flood defenses and shaping future efforts to protect the English coastline from the increasing risks associated with high waves."

    "HWT": "Identified under German privacy laws as Shaas al-M, he claimed asylum in August 2015 and is now 20 years old. Federal prosecutors say before that he fought with the Islamist militants for two years in his home country. He is being tried by a special security court in Berlin, but reports suggest he refused to testify. He has been in custody since his arrest on 22 March. Shaas al-M's trial comes two weeks after Anis Amri ploughed a truck into a Christmas market in Berlin, killing 12 people.

Shaas al-M faces charges of being a member of a foreign terrorist organisation, which carries up to 10 years in jail, and violating laws governing military weapons. In a previous statement (in German), the court detailed allegations of Shaas al-M's involvement in IS operations in Syria, including participating in the siege of the airport at Deir al-Zour, handling a Kalashnikov gun and helping supply fighters with food. Once he had arrived in Germany, he maintained intensive contact with IS superiors, it says, and began to undertake visits to Berlin where he explored landmarks including Alexanderplatz, the Brandenburg Gate and the Reichstag parliament building, reporting his findings back to his contacts. He is also accused of arranging for at least one person to travel to Syria to fight, and offering his services to assist would-be attackers travelling to Germany. The court has scheduled some 25 hearings to run until April.",
    "MGT": "A young Syrian man has appeared in court in Germany, facing charges of collaborating with the so-called Islamic State (IS) to plan potential attacks in Berlin. The trial, which began this week, has drawn significant attention as authorities continue to grapple with the ongoing threat posed by extremist groups across Europe.\n\nProsecutors allege that the man, whose identity has not been disclosed under German privacy laws, was deployed by IS to survey possible targets for violent attacks in the German capital. According to the charges, the defendant was instructed to gather information about high-profile locations and events that could cause maximum disruption and casualties.\n\nThe young man reportedly arrived in Germany as a refugee in 2015 during the height of the Syrian civil war and the subsequent migration crisis. Authorities claim that he later became involved with IS, which tasked him with reconnaissance missions in Berlin. The prosecution argues that his actions formed part of a broader strategy by the extremist group to expand its reach into Europe and carry out attacks in Western countries.\n\nDuring the trial's opening session, the court heard details of the defendant’s alleged communications with IS operatives. Investigators claim that these interactions included discussions about potential targets and instructions on how to carry out attacks. Authorities have not yet disclosed whether any specific plots were imminent or fully developed at the time of the man’s arrest.\n\nThe defense has yet to present its case, but the trial is expected to highlight the challenges faced by European governments in addressing the radicalization of individuals within their borders. Germany, in particular, has been on high alert in recent years following a series of attacks linked to IS and other extremist groups.\n\nIf convicted, the defendant could face a lengthy prison sentence. The case underscores the persistent threat of terrorism in Europe and the importance of international cooperation in preventing future attacks. The trial is set to continue in the coming weeks, with authorities hoping to shed light on the extent of IS’s operations in the region."

    "HWT": "Anne Thomas, of Linc Care, made the comments in light of Welsh government plans published on Tuesday to strengthen care homes regulations. A new law will make care home owners more accountable for their services. Health Minister Mark Drakeford said lessons had been learned from previous care sector scandals. These include the collapsed Operation Jasmine, the UK's biggest investigation into alleged neglect at nursing homes in south Wales, which was carried out by Gwent Police. The operation ended after the owner of some of the care homes concerned, Dr Prana Das, suffered a brain injury and could not stand trial. Ms Thomas said: \"The level of acuity and dependency in nursing homes has changed dramatically over the past few years and the current regulation really looks at the wrong things and so it's great to have something that looks at the kind of evidence that we need to provide [to show] that we're looking after people well.\" According to the Welsh government, the Regulation of Social Care Bill will: Health Minister Mark Drakeford said: \"We have learned lessons from Southern Cross, Mid Staffs, Winterbourne Operation Jasmine and other scandals where people being cared for were badly let down by services.\"",
    "MGT": "The director of a leading social care provider in Wales has expressed concerns that the current inspection regime for the sector is outdated and no longer fit for purpose. The comments come amid growing scrutiny of the social care system, which has been grappling with increasing pressure, staff shortages, and rising demand.\n\nThe director, whose organization plays a significant role in delivering care across the region, highlighted that the inspection framework has failed to keep pace with the evolving challenges faced by the sector. They argued that the system is overly focused on compliance and box-ticking, rather than addressing the broader issues impacting the quality of care and the well-being of both staff and service users.\n\n\"Social care has changed dramatically in recent years, but the way we assess and regulate the sector has not,\" the director stated. \"The current system doesn't account for the realities on the ground, such as the workforce crisis, funding constraints, and the growing complexity of care needs.\"\n\nThe call for reform comes as many social care providers report feeling unsupported in their efforts to deliver high-quality services under increasingly difficult circumstances. The director emphasized the need for a more collaborative and adaptive approach to inspections, one that recognizes the challenges faced by care providers and focuses on fostering improvement rather than punishment.\n\nThe Welsh Government has yet to respond to the comments, but the issue is likely to spark further debate about the future of social care in the region."

The tower was built to mark the battle, but since 2005 it has been fenced off because of falling stone debris. Mr Grayling said there would be a chance to lobby colleagues for cash. The 175ft (53m) high tower was built in 1817 to mark the Battle of Waterloo which took place on 18 June 1815. Celebrations to mark the 200th anniversary of the battle are due to take place in Wellington. Ms Pow called for a debate to be held to \"celebrate and discuss this wonderful anniversary\". \"Perhaps he [Chris Grayling] might find a little pot of money to restore the wonderful Wellington Monument which is in so need of an upgrade,\" she said.

The monument, an iconic landmark in Somerset, was built to commemorate the Duke of Wellington’s victory at Waterloo in 1815. However, time and weather have taken their toll on the structure, leaving it in need of significant repairs.\n\nThe MP emphasized the importance of preserving the monument as a tribute to a defining moment in British history and as a key part of the region’s heritage. The restoration would not only honor the past but also enhance the site as a draw for visitors, benefiting the local economy.\n\nWith the bicentenary of the Battle of Waterloo drawing near, the timing of the funding request is seen as particularly urgent. Advocates for the restoration argue that the anniversary presents a unique opportunity to celebrate the monument’s historical significance while ensuring its future.

    "prompt": "Japan's authorities have seized the passport of a journalist planning to travel to Syria, local media say.",
    "HWT": "It was necessary to confiscate Yuichi Sugimoto's passport in order to protect his life, the authorities said. The 59-year-old photographer, who had planned to enter Syria on 27 February, described the move as a threat to the freedom of press. Two Japanese hostages were killed by Islamic State (IS) militants in Syria in January. However, Mr Sugimoto told reporters that he had no intention to visit areas controlled by IS. It is said to be the first time the Japanese government has taken such a step. The foreign ministry says it is in accordance with a provision in the country's passport law, that allows a confiscation in order to protect the passport holder's life. Mr Sugimoto, who has covered conflict zones in Iraq and Syria before, insists he has always taken precautions and retreated when in danger. \"What happens to my freedom to travel and freedom of the press?\" he told the Japanese paper Asahi Shimbun. He said he was planning to travel to Turkey before entering Syria with a former soldier who had previously worked for Kenji Goto, a fellow journalist who was taken hostage, and killed in Syria last month. A second Japanese citizen, Haruna Yukawa, was also kidnapped and killed by IS militants. After the handling of the hostage crisis, approval ratings for the government of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe have gone up, recent polls show. Two separate surveys conducted by the Yomiuri newspaper and Japan's news agency Kyodo indicate that up to 60% of people approve of the way the government dealt with the crisis. A similar percentage also said Japan's support to countries affected IS should continue to be non-military. In January, Mr Abe promised $200m (Â£130m) in non-military aid for countries fighting Islamic State. Officials said that much of the $200m fund would be focused on helping refugees displaced from Syria and Iraq.",
    "MGT": "Japanese authorities have reportedly confiscated the passport of a journalist planning to travel to Syria, according to local media reports. The move comes amid concerns for the safety of Japanese citizens in the war-torn country, which has long been plagued by conflict and instability.\n\nThe journalist, whose identity has not been disclosed, was allegedly preparing to visit Syria despite repeated warnings from the Japanese government about the dangers associated with such travel. Syria has been the site of ongoing civil war since 2011, with numerous reports of violence, kidnappings, and other risks to foreign nationals. Japan has issued strong advisories against travel to the region, citing serious threats to safety and security.\n\nAuthorities reportedly intervened by seizing the journalist's passport in an effort to prevent the individual from entering Syria. Under Japanese law, the government has the authority to confiscate passports in exceptional circumstances where a citizen’s life or safety is deemed to be at risk. The decision appears to have been made with the intention of protecting the journalist from potential harm.\n\nThe case has sparked debate in Japan over the balance between individual freedom and government intervention. Critics argue that the confiscation of a passport infringes on personal liberties, while supporters contend that it is a necessary measure to ensure the safety of citizens. The incident highlights the challenges faced by governments in addressing the rights of individuals who willingly choose to travel to dangerous regions despite clear warnings.\n\nThis is not the first time Japan has taken steps to prevent citizens from entering conflict zones. In previous years, Japanese nationals have been kidnapped or killed in areas of unrest, prompting the government to intensify its efforts to discourage such travel. Authorities have emphasized the importance of prioritizing safety, given the unpredictable and volatile nature of situations in countries like Syria.\n\nWhile the journalist has yet to issue a public statement on the matter, the case marks another instance of Japan’s proactive approach to safeguarding its citizens from potential harm abroad. The government’s actions underscore its commitment to minimizing risks and ensuring security in high-risk scenarios."

    "HWT": "Glasgow's Bennett, 23 on Wednesday, was due to resume contact work on Monday after suffering a shoulder injury against Racing 92 three weeks ago. \"It's his first day in terms of contact, so he's back in the mix,\" said Scotland assistant coach Matt Taylor. \"I think he has a good chance but he'll have to put his best foot forward.\" Bennett has scored six tries in 13 Tests and was one of the stand-out performers in Scotland's World Cup campaign last autumn. With fellow Glasgow centres Alex Dunbar, Peter Horne and Richie Vernon all ruled out of at least the start of the Six Nations - or in Vernon's case, the entire Championship - Bennett's possible availability would be a major boost. \"A fully-fit Bennett is a very good player,\" Taylor noted. \"There is a reason he played so well in the World Cup, so it is great he is back in the mix.\" Scotland wing Sean Maitland has also been declared fully fit after coming through a full game for London Irish on the weekend. But Harlequins wing Tim Visser is still a \"couple of weeks off\" and unlikely to be available before Scotland's third Six Nations match against Italy in Rome. With Matt Scott likely to start at inside centre, Bennett is competing with Saracens' Duncan Taylor for the number 13 jersey against England. The in-form Taylor has been a vital source of intelligence on England's likely defensive set-up, with new Red Rose assistant coach Paul Gustard set to bring his famed 'wolf-pack' approach from Saracens into the national squad. \"I think Duncan is caught between a rock and a hard place,\" grinned Taylor. \"He feels like he has been giving out all this information on how Saracens, and now England, are defending. That is hard when there are other guys in our group from the likes of Gloucester and Bath who can benefit. \"But that is international rugby. We have been talking about how they defend and Duncan gives us an insight into what to expect. But we will be trying to concentrate on what we do.\"",
    "MGT": "Scotland rugby fans have received a boost ahead of the highly anticipated Six Nations opener against England this Saturday, as centre Mark Bennett has returned to training and is in contention for selection. The experienced midfielder, who has been an instrumental figure in Scotland's backline in recent years, is said to have a \"good chance\" of making the starting lineup.\n\nBennett's availability comes as welcome news for head coach Gregor Townsend, who is preparing his squad for the annual Calcutta Cup clash at Twickenham. The 30-year-old has been a consistent performer for both club and country, known for his dynamic running lines, solid defensive skills, and ability to create opportunities for his teammates. His presence in the squad would add depth and experience to the Scottish midfield as they look to start their Six Nations campaign on a high note.\n\nThe centre had been a doubt for the match after picking up a minor knock during club duties earlier in the season, but his return to training this week has raised hopes that he will be ready to take the field. Townsend, speaking to reporters, expressed optimism about Bennett's chances of featuring in the match. \"Mark has been working hard to get back to full fitness, and it's great to see him back in training. He's an important player for us, and there's a good chance he'll be ready for Saturday,\" Townsend said.\n\nBennett's potential inclusion would be a significant boost to Scotland as they prepare to face an England side eager to make a strong start under new head coach Steve Borthwick. The Calcutta Cup fixture has historically been one of the fiercest rivalries in international rugby, with Scotland having enjoyed recent success against their southern neighbors, including their memorable 20-17 victory at Murrayfield in last year's tournament.\n\nAs the countdown to Saturday's showdown continues, Scotland's preparations appear to be gathering momentum. The squad will be looking to build on their recent performances and maintain their competitive edge in what promises to be a tightly contested Six Nations competition.\n\nBennett's final availability is expected to be confirmed in the coming days as Townsend and his coaching staff finalize their starting XV. For now, Scottish supporters will be hopeful that the talented centre will be ready to play his part in what could be another memorable chapter in the Calcutta Cup rivalry."

    "HWT": "Maria Pridmore, 36, was jailed for three years in August after she admitted a string of frauds. They included obtaining more than £16,000 in housing benefit, council tax benefit and income support. Pridmore, who was described in court as a \"Walter Mitty\" fraudster, also stole over £30,000 from four women. She appeared by video-link at Lincoln Crown Court from Drake Hall prison in Staffordshire where she is serving her sentence. The court heard Pridmore, a former drug addict, benefitted by £56,679 from her crimes but had no available assets which could be confiscated to pay back her victims. Judge Simon Hirst ruled that in the circumstances a nominal sum of £1 should be paid. Pridmore made news in 2012 when she gave birth to a daughter after previously suffering 14 miscarriages, a stillbirth and the death of an infant son. At her sentence hearing, the court heard the former nurse had been claiming to be a lone-parent with dependent children in order to get benefits, but at various times failed to declare she had moved or was living with her then partner as man and wife. Pridmore also pocketed more than £30,000 from friends and two elderly women, and used the bank details of one of her victims to pay for a £60 taxi fare to attend a court hearing. She stole almost £8,000 from one victim, an 84-year-old vulnerable woman. Pridmore, of Angel Lane, Holbeach, Lincolnshire, previously admitted seven charges of benefit fraud between August 2010 and March 2013, 19 charges of fraud and theft between January 2013 and May 2016 and stealing her father's flat-packed kitchen in April 2015.",
    "MGT": "A woman who fraudulently claimed more than £50,000 in benefits and exploited vulnerable individuals has been ordered to pay back just £1. The case, which has drawn widespread public criticism, highlights significant challenges in recovering funds from individuals with no apparent remaining assets.\n\nThe woman, whose name has not been disclosed for legal reasons, managed to illegally obtain the funds over a period of several years by filing false benefit claims and preying on vulnerable people. Authorities revealed that her deceitful actions included falsifying documentation and manipulating individuals in precarious situations to further her schemes.\n\nOnce her crimes were uncovered, she was prosecuted and received a sentence for her fraudulent activities. However, during a recent court hearing, it was determined that she no longer has any significant financial assets. Under the Proceeds of Crime Act, courts are required to assess the defendant’s current financial situation to determine the amount that can realistically be retrieved. In this case, the court ruled that she could only pay a nominal sum of £1.\n\nThis ruling has sparked outrage among members of the public and advocacy groups, who argue that the punishment fails to reflect the harm caused by her actions. Critics have also pointed out that the decision may undermine confidence in the justice system’s ability to deal with financial crimes.\n\nA spokesperson for the prosecution noted that while the £1 repayment may seem insufficient, the order allows authorities to recover further funds should her financial situation improve in the future. Nonetheless, the case serves as a stark reminder of the difficulties in securing restitution for crimes that often leave victims with little recourse.\n\nThe woman is reportedly under ongoing supervision to prevent her from engaging in similar fraudulent activities in the future."

TV3's owner, Sweden's MTG, is a major player in the broadcasting sector. Russian-language media is dominated by pro-Kremlin, Russia-made content. In response, Latvia has given closer official scrutiny to media policy and in 2016 temporarily banned a Russian TV network for \"inciting hatred\".

Inbox.lv portal, offering email, dating and photo services, is one of the most-visited sites.",
    "MGT": "Latvia's media landscape highlights the linguistic and cultural divide between its Latvian and Russian-speaking communities. This division is deeply rooted in the country's history, demographics, and political dynamics. Since regaining independence from the Soviet Union in 1991, Latvia has prioritized strengthening its national identity, including the promotion of the Latvian language. However, a significant portion of the population, roughly 25%, identifies Russian as their primary language, leading to distinct media ecosystems that cater to each linguistic group.\n\nLatvian-language media often emphasize national identity, European integration, and Western alliances, reflecting the country's geopolitical orientation. In contrast, Russian-language outlets cater to the Russian-speaking minority, focusing on issues relevant to their community while maintaining ties to Russian culture and perspectives. This divergence sometimes results in contrasting narratives on political developments, international relations, and societal issues.\n\nThe split is further influenced by external factors, such as Russian state media, which has a considerable influence over Russian-speaking audiences in Latvia. The Latvian government has taken steps to counter this by promoting Latvian-language content and regulating media that may spread disinformation. Still, the linguistic and cultural gap underscores broader challenges in fostering social cohesion in a diverse and historically complex society."

    "HWT": "Councillor Graham Hinchey said the authority still faced a real terms cut to its budget despite its grant from the Welsh Government rising by 0.3%. The authority is looking at increasing council tax by 3.7% and making cuts of £17m. Costs for burials as well as births, deaths and marriage registration and school meals could all rise in 2017-18. Along with the proposed cuts, £1.5m from reserves, £1.9m from school budgets and £4.4m from the planned increased in council tax would help make up the shortfall. The cuts are smaller than 2015-16, when £32m in savings was proposed, and 2016-17, when the shortfall was £45m. Proposals include: Cardiff council saw its Welsh Government grant rise by 0.3% to £428m. The overall budget for 2017-18 is £578m. Mr Hinchey, cabinet member for corporate services and performance, said: \"The provisional settlement from Welsh Government is slightly more favourable than we bargained for. \"However, it is still a cut in real terms because of price and pay inflation.\" The council is asking residents to share their views on the proposals in a consultation, which runs from 10 November to 11 December.",
    "MGT": "Cardiff Council faces a financial challenge as it seeks to address a £25 million budget gap for the upcoming fiscal year. The local authority has revealed the extent of the shortfall, highlighting the growing pressures on public services amid rising costs and reduced funding.\n\nOfficials say the gap is partly due to inflation and increasing demand for essential services, including social care and education. They also pointed to the ongoing impact of the pandemic, which has strained local government resources over the past few years. The council has warned that tough decisions will need to be made to ensure the books are balanced without compromising critical services.\n\nIn a statement, council leaders stressed their commitment to protecting the most vulnerable residents, while acknowledging that cuts in some areas may be unavoidable. Efforts to identify savings and explore alternative sources of funding are already underway, with proposals expected to be presented in the coming months.\n\nResidents have been urged to participate in consultations to share their views on potential budget priorities. The council emphasized the importance of community input in shaping the difficult decisions ahead. As Cardiff navigates this financial challenge, leaders say they will work to minimize the impact on frontline services and maintain the city's reputation as a vibrant and thriving capital."

    "prompt": "A United Nations enquiry into the mysterious death of its former head Dag Hammarskjold is due to open.",
    "HWT": "Mr Hammarskjold died in a plane crash in what is now Zambia in 1961, but the cause of the crash has been disputed. There have been claims that the plane was shot down, but a previous UN enquiry did not reach a definitive conclusion. The Swedish diplomat was on his way to negotiate a ceasefire in the breakaway Congolese state of Katanga. He was trying to mediate between Congo's Soviet-backed government and Moise Tshombe, who had declared independence for the mineral-rich province of Katanga. He was flying to Ndola, in what was then Northern Rhodesia, to meet Mr Tshombe, who was backed by former colonial power Belgium and some Western mining interests. The UN set up this new enquiry after a group of independent investigators said that there was significant new evidence concerning Hammarskjold's death. They said the evidence was \"persuasive\" that \"the aircraft was subjected to some form of attack\". The commission said that the US National Security Agency (NSA) might hold crucial evidence. It said that given the NSA's worldwide monitoring activities at that time, \"it is highly likely\" that the radio traffic on 18-19 September 1961 was recorded by the NSA and possibly also by the CIA. The report said: \"Authenticated recordings of any such cockpit narrative or radio messages, if located, would furnish potentially conclusive evidence of what happened.\" The UN panel will now assess this new information and report back by the end of June.",
    "MGT": "The United Nations is set to launch an inquiry into the mysterious death of its former Secretary-General, Dag Hammarskjöld, whose untimely demise in 1961 has long been shrouded in speculation and controversy. Hammarskjöld, a Swedish diplomat widely respected for his efforts to mediate global conflicts, died in a plane crash while en route to negotiate a ceasefire during the Congo Crisis. The crash, which occurred near Ndola in what is now Zambia, claimed the lives of all but one person on board.\n\nWhile the initial investigation attributed the crash to pilot error, lingering doubts have persisted for decades. Witness accounts, declassified documents, and independent research have pointed to the possibility of foul play, including the involvement of foreign governments or private interests intent on undermining Hammarskjöld’s peacekeeping mission. In recent years, renewed calls for transparency and justice have prompted the UN to revisit the case.\n\nThe inquiry will examine newly uncovered evidence, including archival material and witness testimonies, to determine whether external factors contributed to the crash. António Guterres, the current UN Secretary-General, has expressed his commitment to uncovering the truth, calling Hammarskjöld’s death a matter of \"unfinished business\" for the organization. Advocates for the investigation argue that resolving the mystery is crucial to upholding the integrity of the UN and honoring Hammarskjöld’s legacy.\n\nThe inquiry is expected to face significant challenges, including access to classified files and the passage of time, which has complicated the collection of reliable evidence. Nevertheless, it represents a renewed effort to address one of the most enduring mysteries in the history of international diplomacy. The findings could have profound implications for how history remembers Dag Hammarskjöld and his work for peace."

Assistant coroner Johanna Thompson, at Norfolk Coroner's Court, said they died from gunshot wounds to the head. At the hearings in Norwich, she said she requested forensic officers to identify their bodies by using DNA evidence. She said: \"Mrs Muncaster was found at her home property by police, having suffered what appeared to be a gunshot injury to the head. \"A post-mortem report confirmed the cause as being due to a shotgun wound to the head. \"Mr Muncaster was found in the front garden of the property, having suffered what appeared to be a gunshot injury to the head.\" She added that a post-mortem report confirmed that as the cause of his death.

The couple, whose names have not been disclosed, were found dead under mysterious circumstances, prompting a thorough investigation by local authorities.\n\nThe discovery was made earlier this month when concerned neighbors reported a peculiar absence of activity from the couple’s home. Upon arriving at the scene, police were met with a tragic sight that has since sent ripples of shock throughout the close-knit community. Initial examinations failed to immediately identify the victims, necessitating the involvement of forensic experts who meticulously collected DNA samples from the scene.\n\nThe inquest, which commenced this week, has been tasked with unraveling the circumstances leading to the couple's untimely demise. During the proceedings, it was confirmed that DNA analysis played a crucial role in establishing the identities of the deceased, allowing investigators to piece together the puzzle of what transpired in the days leading up to their deaths.\n\nThe use of DNA technology in forensic investigations has once again proven invaluable, providing a glimmer of clarity amid the ongoing inquiry. Authorities have yet to divulge further details regarding the case, citing the sensitive nature of the investigation. However, they have reassured the public that all necessary measures are being taken to uncover the truth and deliver justice for the couple and their grieving family.\n\nAs the inquest continues, the community remains on edge, anxiously awaiting answers and hoping for closure in the face of this heartbreaking tragedy."

    "HWT": "The graffiti drawn on the paintings, which are about 8,000 years old, was \"a tragedy... offensive to the whole history and memory of Chad,\" Mahamat Saleh Haroun said. Vandals scrawled their names on top of the artworks in French and Arabic. The Ennedi plateau was declared a Unesco world heritage site in 2016. \"It's an African story and they wanted to destroy that. \"That's why I'm talking about a tragedy, because it's a part of us,\" said Mr Haroun, who is also an award-winning filmmaker. Local youths are suspected of being behind the vandalism. A team has now been sent to the site in north-eastern Chad to assess the damage, with a view to sending experts to follow up. The head of the UN's cultural body in the country, Abdelkerim Adoum Bahar, told the BBC that he thought the damage could be repaired. Thousands of images of people and animals have been painted and carved into the rock surface of caves, canyons and shelters in the area, according to UN cultural agency Unesco. Mr Haroun stressed the historical importance of the site, which he said belonged not just to Chad but to the whole world. \"This is a part of our memory. It helps us to understand who we are... We cannot destroy it. If you don't know your past you cannot deal with the present,\" he said.",
    "MGT": "Ancient cave paintings located within the Ennedi Plateau, a UNESCO World Heritage site in the Sahara Desert, have been defaced with graffiti, Chad's Minister of Culture has revealed.

The graffiti, which includes names and crude symbols etched onto the rock surfaces, has marred the integrity of the paintings and raised alarm among archaeologists and conservationists.\n\nThe defacement is believed to have occurred recently, though authorities are still investigating the incident. The minister condemned the act as a \"violation of Chad's cultural heritage\" and called for enhanced measures to protect the site. He emphasized the importance of safeguarding such treasures, not only as a source of national pride but also as a legacy for future generations.\n\nExperts have warned that the graffiti poses a serious threat to the preservation of the paintings, which have already been vulnerable to natural erosion and climate change. Conservationists are now working to assess the extent of the damage and determine whether restoration is possible.\n\nThe incident has sparked calls for greater awareness and stricter enforcement of protections for cultural heritage sites, as well as an appeal for international cooperation to prevent further vandalism. For Chad, whose rich history is etched into the landscape of the Ennedi Plateau, the loss is a poignant reminder of the fragile nature of humanity's shared heritage."

    "HWT": "They accuse Sushila Karki of delivering biased verdicts and interfering in the executive's jurisdiction. At least 249 MPs signed the motion, well over the quarter required to open an impeachment investigation. It comes after the Supreme Court overturned the government's choice of chief of police. Last month the court ruled in favour of a claim by Navaraj Silwal, the most senior officer in the ranks, that he had been unfairly bypassed in favour of a less senior colleague, Jaya Bahadur Chand. A hearing has been scheduled for Tuesday 2 May on the government's second choice of candidate, Prakash Aryal, local media report. How Nepal quake turned women into builders The women banished to a hut during their periods Critics say there is a history of political parties determining police appointments on the basis of \"undue favours rather than merit\". Nepalese media reports say there had been disagreement within the coalition over the appointment. Ms Karki, the head of the Supreme Court, is now automatically suspended from her duties while an impeachment committee is formed and carries out an investigation. The conclusion will then be put to a parliamentary vote, with a two-thirds majority required. The ruling coalition, made up of the UCPN (Maoist-Centre), the Nepali Congress and some smaller parties, would need outside support to pass it.

    "MGT": "Nepal finds itself in the midst of a significant judicial and political upheaval as its first female Chief Justice, Cholendra Shumsher JBR, faces suspension following an impeachment motion. The motion, filed by the two largest parties within the ruling coalition, has sparked intense debate and scrutiny within the nation, highlighting the fragile balance between politics and the judiciary.\n\nThe impeachment motion, brought forth by the Nepali Congress and the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist Centre), alleges misconduct and abuse of power by Chief Justice Cholendra Shumsher JBR. The motion accuses her of compromising the independence of the judiciary and exceeding her jurisdiction in several high-profile cases. This development has led to her immediate suspension, pending further investigation and proceedings.\n\nThe move has drawn mixed reactions from various sectors in Nepal. Supporters of the impeachment argue that it is a necessary step to maintain the integrity and independence of the judiciary. They believe that Chief Justice Cholendra Shumsher JBR's actions have undermined public confidence in the judicial system. Conversely, critics assert that the impeachment motion is politically motivated, aiming to manipulate the judiciary for partisan gains.\n\nThe suspension marks a critical moment in Nepal's political landscape, as it grapples with issues of governance and judicial independence. This incident underscores the ongoing challenges faced by the young republic in establishing a stable democratic framework. As the impeachment process unfolds, it is expected to have far-reaching implications on the country's judicial and political systems.\n\nIn the coming weeks, all eyes will be on the parliamentary proceedings as lawmakers debate the merits of the allegations. The outcome will likely set a precedent for how Nepal addresses concerns of judicial conduct and independence in the future."

    "HWT": "The new buzzwords are to be \"outcomes\" and \"indicators\". They are words most people living in Scotland or Finland will be very familiar with. Because Stormont's administrators have been studying what happens in those countries and they like what they see. Scotland has a series of sixteen National Outcomes which describe what the Government there wants to do over the next ten years. This so-called outcomes based approach to government focuses on actual results achieved. The theory is it allows the government and wider public sector to focus on making sustainable improvements to public services and the quality of life for people in Scotland. A series of indicators allow them to track progress towards the achievements of these outcomes. Sources close to the negotiations for a programme for government at Stormont say this is the model they intend to follow. One source said it is about \"doing things differently\" and denied the change was merely cosmetic. As a first step a \"framework\" programme for government will be produced in just over a fortnight. It will then go out to consultation. At the end of this year it will be replaced with a detailed programme for government. There will also be a budget, not for one year but for the next three to four years. And there will be documents setting out strategies on the economy, capital investment and social policy strategy. Sources say this is not a programme for one Assembly mandate but for a 10 - 15 year period. They say it will also require the civil service to be \"more outward facing.\" Politically, this seems the model Sinn FÃ©in and the DUP intend to move forward with - with or without the other parties. Can the SDLP, Ulster Unionists and Alliance agree to go into the next Executive on the basis of a \"framework\"  programme knowing they won't get the real detail for another seven months?",
    "MGT": "Northern Ireland’s political landscape is on the verge of significant change as Stormont’s system of government is poised for a major overhaul. The move comes in response to mounting concerns over the functionality and sustainability of the current setup, which has faced repeated challenges in recent years.\n\nThe proposed changes aim to address long-standing issues within the power-sharing arrangement that has defined Northern Ireland’s governance since the Good Friday Agreement in 1998. Critics have argued that the current system, designed to promote cooperation between unionists and nationalists, has often led to political deadlock, undermining the delivery of effective governance. Periods of stalemate, including the prolonged collapse of the devolved government from 2017 to 2020, have heightened calls for reform.\n\nWhile details of the proposed makeover are still emerging, sources suggest a focus on fostering greater stability and inclusivity within the Assembly. Potential reforms may include adjustments to the designation system, which currently requires members to align as unionists, nationalists, or others, as well as changes to the mechanisms for electing a first and deputy first minister. These changes are aimed at reducing the risk of stalemates and ensuring that governance continues even in politically contentious periods.\n\nThe announcement of the potential overhaul has sparked a range of reactions. Proponents of reform argue that modernizing Stormont’s structures is essential to addressing Northern Ireland’s pressing social and economic challenges. They point to the need for a government that can effectively tackle issues such as healthcare, education, and economic development without being hindered by political impasses.\n\nHowever, some political leaders have expressed caution, warning that any changes must respect the delicate balance of power enshrined in the Good Friday Agreement. They emphasize the importance of maintaining a framework that ensures representation and equality for all communities in Northern Ireland.\n\nAs discussions around the proposed reforms continue, there is hope that a revamped system of government could pave the way for a more stable and effective political future in Northern Ireland. The coming months will be crucial as stakeholders work to shape a system that reflects the evolving needs and aspirations of the region."

    "HWT": "When the law comes into effect on 1 January, the Golden State will become the first to outlaw the practice for people under the age of 18. The bill was backed by mental health groups, and gay rights activists say reparative or \"conversion therapy\" can increase risk of depression or suicide. Counselling and prayer is used to help some Christians deal with gay urges. The bill was signed over the weekend along with more than 100 pieces of legislation sent to the governor by California's state legislature. Two Christian groups, the California-based Pacific Justice Institute and the Florida-based Liberty Counsel will challenge the law. The Liberty Counsel said it planned to argue in its lawsuit that the measure infringes on the First Amendment and equal protection rights. In his statement, Gov Brown said sexual orientation change efforts \"have no basis in science or medicine and they will now be relegated to the dustbin of quackery\". The Human Rights Campaign, an advocacy group, said: \"We're grateful to Governor Brown for standing with California's children. \"LGBT [lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender] youth will now be protected from a practice that has not only been debunked as junk science, but has been proven to have drastically negative effects on their well-being,\" the gay rights advocate added, urging other states to take up similar measures. But the National Association for Research and Therapy on Homosexuality said the bill was a \"legislative over-reach\". Some conservative groups have said banning the therapy would restrict a parent's right to care for children going through gender confusion. California is embroiled in a long-standing legal tussle over gay marriage. A law called Proposition 8 banned same-sex marriage in California just months after it had been introduced. But a court overturned the ban in 2010. After an appeal was upheld, the matter may now come before the US Supreme Court for a final ruling.",
    "MGT": "California Governor Jerry Brown has officially signed legislation banning the controversial practice of conversion therapy aimed at altering the sexual orientation of minors. The new law, which takes effect on January 1, marks California as the first state in the nation to prohibit licensed therapists from engaging in efforts to change the sexual orientation of individuals under 18.\n\nConversion therapy, often referred to as \"reparative therapy,\" has long been criticized by medical professionals and advocacy groups as harmful and scientifically unfounded. The practice, which seeks to make gay teenagers straight, has been condemned by organizations such as the American Psychological Association, which has stated that the therapy can lead to depression, anxiety, and even suicidal ideation.\n\nGovernor Brown called the therapy “quackery” in a statement following the signing of the legislation. He emphasized the importance of protecting young people from practices that lack scientific credibility and can cause significant psychological damage. \"These practices have no basis in science or medicine, and they will now be relegated to the dustbin of quackery,\" Brown declared.\n\nThe law, sponsored by State Senator Ted Lieu, faced strong opposition from some conservative and religious groups, who argued that the ban infringes on parental rights and religious freedom. Proponents of the bill, however, argued that the measure was necessary to safeguard the well-being of LGBTQ youth, many of whom already face significant challenges in their daily lives.\n\n“For decades, LGBTQ youth have been subjected to therapies that tell them they are broken, abnormal, or sinful,” said Senator Lieu. “Today, California is saying ‘no more.’ We are standing up for the rights and dignity of our young people.”\n\nThe legislation has been widely praised by LGBTQ advocacy organizations, who hailed it as a landmark decision in the ongoing fight for equality. Human Rights Campaign President Chad Griffin called the law a “historic step forward” and urged other states to follow California’s lead.\n\nWith this ban, California sets a precedent that could influence other states to reconsider their stance on conversion therapy, potentially paving the way for broader protections for LGBTQ youth nationwide."

    "prompt": "A new driver who caused the death of a holidaymaker in a 100mph crash has been jailed for five years.",
    "HWT": "Sean Sullivan, 20, had only passed his test the day before the crash which killed Timothy Malone near Cefn Bryn Common, Gower, on 31 July 2016. Swansea Crown Court heard Sullivan had ignored pleas from his passengers to slow down. He pleaded guilty to one count of death by dangerous driving and one of causing serious injury by dangerous driving. Sullivan also admitted two other charges of dangerous driving involving two other drivers. Prosecuting, Ian Wright said airbag data from Sullivan's car showed four seconds before impact, it was travelling at 98mph and the throttle was at 100% at 5,000 revs. \"Essentially, his foot was touching the floorboard,\" he said. The court heard Mr Malone, who was was staying in a nearby caravan with his wife, Yvonne Howard, was unable to take evasive action or avoid the head on collision on the country road. Addressing Sullivan in court, Mrs Howard said: \"I am haunted by the images of the terrible events of that night - the last time I saw him. \"I cannot heal my tattered heart and soul. I go to sleep in sadness and wake up to sadness. My face is wet with tears every day.\" Judge Peter Heywood sentenced Sullivan to five years in a young offenders' institution. He will also be banned from driving for four years following his release. Speaking after the case, Inspector Steve Davies of South Wales Police, said: \"Our thoughts, as ever, are with the family and friends of Timothy Malone who lost his life in such devastating circumstances at Cefn Bryn in Gower, last summer. \"This tragic loss of the life has once again highlighted the consequences of a young and inexperienced driver, driving at excessive speed, which puts drivers, passengers and innocent road users at risk of serious injury or death.\"",
    "MGT": "A tragic accident on a busy highway has resulted in the sentencing of a young driver to five years in prison. The incident, which occurred earlier this year, involved a high-speed crash that claimed the life of a holidaymaker. The driver, who had only recently obtained his license, was traveling at a speed of 100mph when he lost control of the vehicle, leading to the fatal collision.\n\nThe court heard that the driver, identified as 22-year-old Ryan Thompson, had been driving recklessly on the day of the crash. Witnesses testified that Thompson was weaving in and out of traffic at high speeds, seemingly in a rush to reach his destination. Tragically, his reckless behavior resulted in a collision that left one man, 45-year-old Michael Adams, dead.\n\nAdams, who was traveling with his family for a much-anticipated holiday, was pronounced dead at the scene. His family, who were in a separate vehicle, were left devastated by the sudden loss of a loving husband and father. In court, Adams' wife tearfully recounted the moments leading up to the crash and the overwhelming grief that has consumed their family since.\n\nDuring sentencing, the judge emphasized the need for accountability and the seriousness of the offense. \"The defendant's actions were not just a momentary lapse in judgment,\" the judge stated. \"They were a conscious decision to disregard the safety of others on the road.\"\n\nThompson, visibly shaken, expressed deep remorse for his actions. \"I never meant for this to happen,\" he said in court. \"I am truly sorry for the pain I've caused the Adams family.\"\n\nThe case has sparked wider discussions about road safety and the responsibilities of new drivers. Many have called for stricter regulations and more comprehensive training for young drivers to prevent similar tragedies in the future.\n\nAs the community grapples with the aftermath of this incident, the Adams family hopes that their tragic loss will serve as a cautionary tale. \"We hope Michael's passing will remind everyone of the importance of driving safely,\" said a family spokesperson. \"No family should have to endure the pain we are experiencing.\""

    "HWT": "Clive Engine House has stood unused for more than 120 years after serving Talargoch Mine in Dyserth until 1884. Now county archaeologists have secured funds to repair the building, which has been affected by weathering over the decades. It was opened to the public on Friday to show how work is progressing. Denbighshire council archaeologist Fiona Gale said: \"It was a fantastic, once in a lifetime opportunity to repair the building and bring it back into good order\". Built in 1860, the Cornish engine house was home to a steam cylinder which powered water extraction pumps. Lead extraction is thought to have taken place at Talargoch since the Roman period. It has also produced copper, silver and calamine, but it is most famous as a producer of lead and zinc ore. The engine house is one of the few remaining signs of what was once a large and important industry in the area. The engine was in operation until the mine closed in 1884 when the engine was sold to the former Westminster Colliery in Wrexham. David Thomas, the Denbighshire cabinet lead member for regeneration, said the building was a \"testament to the hard work of all those who worked in the lead mines in the area over many years\". Grants from funders WREN and Cadw are paying for repair work which is being co-ordinated by Denbighshire council.",
    "MGT": "A historic 19th-century engine building in Denbighshire, once integral to the region's mining operations, is undergoing a significant restoration effort. The structure, which was originally used to house a steam-powered engine that pumped water out of a local mine, stands as a testament to the area’s industrial heritage. Over the years, the building had fallen into disrepair, leaving preservationists concerned about its future.\n\nThe restoration project aims to safeguard the architectural and historical significance of the engine house, which played a vital role in the mining industry during its peak. Experts in heritage conservation have been brought in to ensure the work remains true to the building’s original design and materials. The project involves stabilizing the structure, repairing the masonry, and restoring key features that reflect its industrial purpose.\n\nLocal historians and community members have expressed their enthusiasm for the initiative, praising its role in preserving a piece of Denbighshire’s history. The restoration is expected to attract visitors and provide an educational resource for those interested in the region's industrial past.\n\nFunding for the project has come from a combination of grants and community fundraising efforts, highlighting the public's commitment to preserving the site. Once completed, the restored engine building will stand as a monument to the ingenuity and hard work of the miners and engineers who once relied on it.\n\nThe restoration is expected to be completed within the next year, ensuring that this piece of Denbighshire’s mining legacy will endure for generations to come."

    "prompt": "An e-book at the centre of a row over who can use the term \"space marine\" is back on sale on the Amazon website.",
    "HWT": "The Spots the Space Marine story was taken off Amazon after model-soldier maker Games Workshop complained it infringed its trademark on the phrase. A blog post about the row by the story's US author, Maggie Hogarth, led to much criticism for Games Workshop. And digital rights group the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) said it had then helped Amazon \"review\" the case. In a statement about the row, the EFF said it was \"outrageous\" for Games Workshop to claim any rights over a term that had been in wide use in fiction since the 1930s. It said the case was an example of a growing trend, in which trademark and rights owners targeted the \"weakest link\" in the chain of people that helped content, be it fiction, movies or music, appear online. Often, said the EFF, the weakest link was an ISP, a hosting company or a website that acted as a store front or aggregator for many different creators. Such \"providers usually don't have the resources and/or the inclination to investigate trademark infringement claims\", it said. Many simply removed the disputed content immediately to stay \"neutral\" and avoid trouble, said the EFF, but that made it hard for those on the end of trademark claims to mount a challenge. The online chatter also prompted Games Workshop to put a statement about the row on its Facebook page, in which it said it had \"no choice\" but to act in cases where its trademarks in a commercially available product were being used without its consent. Despite this, it said, it had never claimed to have rights over the ways in which the terms \"warhammer\" or \"space marine\" were used in day-to-day speech. This everyday use also covered a \"body of prose\", it added. \"Trademarks as opposed to use of a word in prose or everyday language are two very different things,\" it said. \"Games Workshop is always vigilant in protecting the former, but never makes any claim to owning the latter.\"",
    "MGT": "An e-book that sparked controversy over the use of the term \"space marine\" has returned to Amazon's online marketplace after being temporarily removed. The book, which had been the subject of a trademark dispute, reignited debate about intellectual property rights and the boundaries of genre-specific language.\n\nThe issue began when Games Workshop, a UK-based company known for its popular tabletop game Warhammer 40,000, claimed trademark rights over the term \"space marine.\" The company alleged that the use of the term in the e-book violated its intellectual property. Games Workshop has long employed the term to describe its heavily armored, genetically enhanced soldiers within the Warhammer universe, a franchise that has garnered a global following.\n\nThe e-book, written by American author M.C.A. Hogarth, is a science fiction work that uses the term \"space marine\" to describe its characters—an archetype that has been a staple of the genre for decades. Fans and authors alike quickly rallied to Hogarth's defense, arguing that \"space marine\" is a generic term widely used in science fiction literature, gaming, and other media. Critics of Games Workshop's claim feared that enforcing such a trademark could set a dangerous precedent, stifling creativity and limiting the use of common genre terminology.\n\nFollowing a public outcry, including vocal support from prominent figures in the publishing industry, Amazon reinstated the e-book on its platform. The decision was met with relief by Hogarth's supporters, who viewed the move as a victory for independent authors and creative freedom. Many argued that the term \"space marine\" predates Games Workshop's use and has been a part of science fiction since at least the 1930s, appearing in stories by authors such as Robert Heinlein.\n\nThe controversy highlights the ongoing tension between intellectual property rights and the broader interests of creators and consumers in a shared cultural landscape. While Games Workshop has not indicated whether it plans to pursue further legal action, the incident has sparked widespread discussion about the balance between protecting trademarks and fostering open artistic expression.\n\nAs the e-book returns to Amazon's shelves, the debate over who truly owns the right to use \"space marine\" remains unresolved, serving as a reminder of the complex interplay between law, creativity, and the evolution of popular culture."

    "HWT": "It all started when the head of Israel's association of tour operators posted a photo of the bill, suggesting the visitors may have been \"suckered\". But the restaurant's owners contest this, and give a different version of how the meal unfolded. They say the group had a gourmet meal and the venue was closed to host them. The bill, from the popular Abu Ghosh restaurant on the outskirts of West Jerusalem, allegedly included 5,900 shekels in alcohol, 4,000 shekels for the use of the private room and 3,150 shekels for the main course. On top of what was consumed by the group, there was a service charge of 1,500 shekels. In a post on Facebook (in Hebrew) with a picture of the bill, Yossi Fatael, chairman of the Israel Incoming Tour Operators Association, said the group's tourist agent confirmed they had paid the bill. \"There may be a billion Chinese, but they may not all be suckers,\" he said. \"This is how we are destroying our own budding potential of the Chinese market in Israel.\" But Jawdat Ibrahim, one of Abu Ghosh's owners, disputed this. He said, also on Facebook (in Hebrew), the group had a gourmet meal that lasted for eight hours, with special desserts, specially ordered alcoholic drinks and artists - and that the restaurant was closed to the public to host them. He also said the eight had insisted on paying the service charge. The post had pictures of what he said was the specially produced decoration to host the group. The Chinese visitors have not been identified. Some 6,900 Chinese tourists visited Israel in July, according to the Central Bureau of Statistics.  In the same month, there were 57,000 tourists from the US and 31,600 from France.",
    "MGT": "A group of eight Chinese tourists dining at a restaurant near Jerusalem recently found themselves at the center of an online controversy after being presented with a bill totaling 16,500 shekels ($4,393; £3,285). The incident, which quickly went viral, has drawn significant attention on social media, with many questioning whether the hefty charge was justified.\n\nAccording to initial reports, the tourists were dining at a high-end establishment known for its premium ingredients and service. The bill included a variety of dishes, beverages, and a service charge. However, the staggering total left the diners stunned, leading them to share their experience online. The post gained traction, sparking heated debates about pricing transparency and whether tourists are being unfairly targeted in certain establishments.\n\nThe restaurant, whose name has not been disclosed, defended the bill, stating that the group had ordered some of the most expensive items on the menu, including premium cuts of meat, fresh seafood, and rare wines. A spokesperson for the establishment claimed that the prices were clearly listed and that the diners had not raised any objections during their meal. \"We pride ourselves on providing a luxury dining experience, and the cost reflects the quality of our offerings,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nDespite the restaurant's explanation, public opinion remains divided. Some have argued that the tourists were taken advantage of due to their unfamiliarity with local pricing practices, while others have pointed out that dining at an upscale restaurant naturally comes with a higher price tag. Several commenters emphasized the importance of carefully reviewing menus and asking questions to avoid surprises.\n\nThe incident has also prompted calls for greater regulation of restaurant pricing, particularly in areas frequented by tourists. While the full details of the dispute remain unclear, the story has highlighted the potential pitfalls of dining abroad and the importance of fostering transparency in the hospitality industry."

    "HWT": "Cyprus was the only crisis-hit eurozone country to restrict capital transfers, as it faced a run on the banks. The controls were eased in January. There will no longer be a monthly cap of €20,000 (£15,000; $22,000) on transfers by individuals to foreign banks, or of €10,000 for travellers moving money out of the country. Cyprus received a €10bn bailout from the EU and International Monetary Fund (IMF) after its biggest banks nearly collapsed in March 2013 because of huge losses on their Greek investments. The island's second-biggest lender, Cyprus Popular Bank (also known as Laiki Bank), was wound up and deposits worth more than €100,000 in the largest bank, Bank of Cyprus, were seized. Those measures were part of the deal to ensure that Cyprus funded part of the €10bn bailout. Speaking on Friday, Cyprus President Nicos Anastasiades voiced confidence that the Mediterranean island was recovering well, despite three years of recession. Lifting capital controls, he said, was \"a vote of confidence in our banking system which, now fully independent of Greek banking institutions, can move forward\". The Greek debt crisis had a severe impact on Cypriot banks, which lost about €4.5bn worth of Greek sovereign bonds - equivalent to 25% of Cypriot gross domestic product, Reuters news agency reports.",
    "MGT": "Cyprus announced the removal of all remaining capital controls that were introduced during the 2013 financial crisis, marking a significant milestone in the island nation’s economic recovery. The decision, revealed by Finance Minister Harris Georgiades, ends restrictions that were initially implemented to prevent the collapse of the banking system and stabilize the economy following the crisis.\n\nThe controls, which included limits on money transfers and withdrawals, were part of a broader package of emergency measures enacted during a tumultuous period for Cyprus’s financial sector. The crisis was triggered by the exposure of Cypriot banks to Greek debt and required a controversial €10 billion bailout from international lenders, including the European Union and the International Monetary Fund. As part of the bailout terms, Cyprus agreed to restructure its banking system, including imposing losses on large depositors.\n\nGeorgiades emphasized that the lifting of the controls reflects the country’s return to stability and confidence in its banking sector. He noted that Cyprus has successfully rebuilt trust in its financial institutions and created a more resilient economic framework. The move is expected to enhance the island’s attractiveness to investors and facilitate smoother financial transactions.\n\nCyprus’s economy has shown steady improvement since the crisis, with growth rates recovering and unemployment levels declining. Officials expressed optimism that the removal of capital controls would further bolster the country’s economic prospects and solidify its position as a stable financial hub in the region."

    "HWT": "The 14-year-old boy and another protester were shot dead in the western city of Barquisimeto on Tuesday night. The local governor blamed armed government supporters. Two students were killed during protests last week. Nicolas Maduro's presidency has come under increasing pressure as the economy suffers and opponents accuse him of creating a dictatorship. Mr Maduro was pelted with objects by angry protesters as he left a military event in the south-eastern state of Bolivar earlier on Tuesday. The latest anti-government demonstrations were sparked by a decision on Friday to bar opposition leader Henrique Capriles from holding public office for 15 years. The dead teenager was identified as Brayan Principal by opposition MP Alfonso Marquina, who said he had been shot in the abdomen. A 36-year-old man was also killed in Barquisimeto in a separate incident, the state prosecution service said. Opposition leaders are calling for a date to be set for postponed regional elections.

Witnesses claimed that authorities used tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse crowds, though tensions ultimately spiraled into violence.\n\nThe teenager's death has further heightened tensions in a nation already consumed by uncertainty and anger. Human rights organizations have condemned the use of force against demonstrators, accusing the government of suppressing dissent and violating fundamental freedoms. Protesters, many of them young people, have vowed to continue their fight for change despite the risks.\n\nThe Venezuelan government has yet to issue an official statement regarding the incident, though opposition leaders have called for accountability and demanded international intervention.

The incident has since sparked widespread debate and scrutiny over the league's handling of game equipment and its enforcement of regulations.\n\nIn response, the NFL has pledged to implement stricter monitoring of game balls for the Super Bowl, ensuring they meet the required specifications. This includes assigning additional personnel to oversee the balls' preparation and handling before and during the game. These measures aim to prevent any tampering and restore confidence in the fairness of the competition.\n\nAs anticipation builds for the Super Bowl, fans and teams alike are eager to see the outcome of both the game and the investigation. The NFL's commitment to transparency and fairness will be closely watched, with the hope that these efforts will quell concerns and reaffirm the sport's integrity."

    "prompt": "Police searching for missing toddler Ben Needham on the Greek island of Kos have uncovered ancient graves.",
    "HWT": "The 21-month-old from Sheffield went missing during a family holiday in 1991. Following a suggestion he may have been killed and buried on the island a fresh excavation of farmland began on Monday. The four or five graves are believed to date from 1,500 years ago but police said the discovery would not hamper the investigation. Forensic archaeologists have said they are confident the search is being conducted at exactly the right depth of soil relevant to 25 years ago. The digging has concentrated on an area around a waste tank. Nutrients found in the soil have indicated human traces and a full analysis of soil samples will be carried out. Officers have said they believe the material will most likely relate to a nearby cess tank. Danny Savage, BBC correspondent in Kos The graves found in Kos are all believed to contain the remains of adults. They are lying head to toe close to the boundary of the olive grove where the dig is taking place. Work will continue around them and police said the ancient discovery was not unexpected. There was initial concern from Greek locals that this would have hindered progress at the site but I have been told by the investigating team here in Kos that is not the case. The site being searched is on land where Ben was last seen playing while his grandfather was renovating a property 25 years ago. The Needham family have always believed Ben was abducted but South Yorkshire Police are now investigating whether he was accidentally run over and killed by a bulldozer.",
    "MGT": "Authorities investigating the disappearance of toddler Ben Needham on the Greek island of Kos have made an unexpected discovery: ancient graves. The development came as police continued their search for the British child, who vanished in 1991 at the age of 21 months. \n\nThe graves, believed to date back centuries, were unearthed during an excavation conducted as part of the ongoing efforts to locate Ben. While the discovery is not linked to the case, it has added a historical dimension to an already complex investigation. Archaeologists have been called in to examine the site, which contains human remains and artifacts, potentially shedding light on the island’s past.\n\nThe search for Ben resumed recently after new leads came to light, prompting British and Greek authorities to collaborate. Excavations have focused on areas around the farmhouse where the toddler was last seen. Over the years, various theories have emerged, including the possibility that Ben was accidentally killed and his body buried. Despite extensive searches, no conclusive evidence has been found.\n\nBen’s mother, Kerry Needham, has spent decades campaigning for answers and continues to hold out hope for definitive closure. Speaking earlier this week, she expressed gratitude to the police for their ongoing efforts.\n\nThe discovery of the ancient graves has drawn the attention of local residents and historians alike, with many speculating about their origins. However, the focus remains on the search for Ben. Authorities have assured the public that they will continue their work undeterred by the unexpected findings. As the investigation progresses, both the Needham family and the broader community await answers in one of Greece’s most enduring missing persons cases."

    "HWT": "The contraction, which was bigger than analysts expected, was largely due to a slump in mining activity, the figures from Statistics South Africa showed. Gold mining saw production fall, as well as platinum and diamond mining. Workers in platinum mines have been on strike for five months. \"This makes for grim reading,\" said Razia Khan at Standard Chartered Bank. \"Mining, hit by protracted industrial unrest, fell almost 25% on an annualised basis. Manufacturing was down 4.4%.\" This is the first quarter of negative growth since the second quarter of 2009. In the final quarter of 2013, the economy grew by an annualised rate of 3.8%. The rand fell by about 1% against the dollar following the release of the figures, to 10.44 rand. Compared with a year earlier, the South African economy grew by 1.6%. GDP growth has been slowing steadily for the past three years as the economy struggles with high levels of unemployment, which currently stand at almost 25%.",
    "MGT": "South Africa's economy contracted by an annualised rate of 0.6% in the first quarter of the year, marking its worst quarterly performance in five years, according to official data released this week. This decline raises concerns about the country's economic stability and its ability to recover amid ongoing challenges.\n\nThe contraction was driven by underperformance in several key sectors, including manufacturing, mining, and agriculture, which continue to struggle with persistent issues such as power outages, labor disruptions, and weak global demand. Analysts note that the latest figures reflect deep structural challenges within the economy, which have been exacerbated by political uncertainty and slow implementation of economic reforms.\n\nThis disappointing start to the year has heightened fears of a possible recession, as growth remains elusive despite government efforts to stimulate economic activity and attract investment. Economists warn that addressing South Africa's economic woes will require bold and decisive measures to tackle unemployment, inequality, and infrastructure deficiencies.\n\nThe latest data adds pressure on policymakers to implement urgent changes to restore investor confidence and drive sustainable growth. As the nation grapples with these challenges, the road to recovery appears fraught with uncertainty."

    "HWT": "Media playback is not supported on this device Carrick, hammered 4-0 by the Crues three days earlier, were amazingly 3-0 up at half-time after goals by Daniel Kelly, Adam Salley and Aaron Harmon. Crusaders replied through Michael Carvill, Paul Heatley and an Aaron Smyth own goal but sub Ben Roy's 87th minute finish sealed the surprise win. Josh Robinson of Crusaders and Carrick boss Gary Haveron got late red cards. Crusaders remain five points ahead of second-placed Linfield. Defender Robinson received the red card for a crunching touchline challenge on home striker Roy. It sparked ugly scenes as players and management clashed on the side of the pitch. Rangers manager Haveron was sent to the stand for his part in the unseemly scuffle. However, the Carrick boss will have been pleased with his side as they move above Ballinamallard and into 10th place in the relegation battle. They had lost their last 13 matches against the Crues, but raced into an early lead thanks to a curling Kelly effort. Salley doubled their advantage on 29 minutes when he rifled the ball past keeper Sean O'Neill. It was the youngster's second goal since joining Rangers on loan from Linfield in January. Salley then turned provider for Carrick's third, beating Colin Coates before teeing up Harmon for a simple finish before the break. Crusaders hit back with Carvill pouncing early in the second half and, when Heatley pounced on a poor kick-out by keeper Brian Neeson to make it 3-2, the comeback looked on. But Roy, just on as a replacement, raced through to put Carrick 4-2 up. Robinson's red card and the subsequent touchline brawl soured things and the own goal came too late to save Crusaders.",
    "MGT": "Carrick Rangers delivered a stunning upset on Tuesday night as they edged past reigning champions Crusaders in a thrilling 4-3 encounter in the Irish Premiership. The match, played under the floodlights, showcased a rollercoaster of emotions and a spirited performance from the underdogs, who refused to be overawed by their more illustrious opponents.\n\nThe game began with Crusaders asserting their dominance, taking an early lead through a well-taken goal that seemed to set the tone for what many expected to be a routine victory for the champions. However, Carrick Rangers had other plans, as they responded with relentless energy and tenacity, equalizing shortly after with a clinical finish that caught the Crusaders' defense off guard.\n\nThe first half saw both teams trading blows, with Carrick surprisingly taking a 2-1 lead before the break, leaving the home crowd stunned. Crusaders emerged from the interval with renewed determination, quickly leveling the score at 2-2. But Carrick, undeterred, surged forward yet again, netting twice more in a breathtaking display of counter-attacking football.\n\nWith the score at 4-2 and time running out, Crusaders mounted a late rally, pulling one goal back to make it 4-3. The champions threw everything they had at Carrick in the dying moments, but the visitors held firm, defending with grit and discipline to secure a historic victory.\n\nThis result sent shockwaves through the league and highlighted the unpredictable nature of football. For Carrick Rangers, it was a night to remember, as they proved they could go toe-to-toe with the best in the league. For Crusaders, it was a humbling reminder that no match can be taken for granted. The underdogs’ triumph will undoubtedly live long in the memory of their fans and serve as a testament to their resilience and determination."

The Posh emerged victorious thanks to goals from Britt Assombalonga and Nathaniel Mendez-Laing, both of whom delivered standout performances that underscored their attacking prowess.\n\nThe game kicked off with Peterborough displaying their intentions right from the start. Their aggressive approach and quick passing put Exeter on the back foot, with the home side dominating possession. It didn’t take long for the breakthrough to come. In the 15th minute, Assombalonga latched onto a perfectly weighted through ball from midfielder Jack Taylor, expertly slotting it past the Exeter goalkeeper with a clinical finish. The goal sent the home fans into raptures and set the tone for the rest of the match.\n\nExeter, to their credit, responded with determination, trying to claw their way back into the game. Their playmaker, Jevani Brown, was instrumental in orchestrating several counter-attacks, but the Peterborough defense, marshaled by captain Frankie Kent, stood firm, denying the visitors any clear-cut chances.\n\nAs the first half drew to a close, Peterborough continued to assert their dominance. Nathaniel Mendez-Laing, a constant thorn in Exeter's side, showcased his dribbling skills and pace, consistently troubling the Exeter full-backs. His efforts finally paid off in the 38th minute when he doubled Peterborough's lead. After receiving a pass from winger Kwame Poku, Mendez-Laing danced past two defenders before unleashing a powerful strike that left the goalkeeper with no chance.\n\nThe second half saw Exeter attempting to regroup and find a way back into the contest. Manager Matt Taylor made a few tactical changes, introducing fresh legs in an effort to spark a comeback. However, Peterborough's defense remained resolute, and their midfield continued to control the tempo, effectively quelling any threat from the visitors.\n\nAs the final whistle blew, Peterborough's players celebrated a well-deserved win, with the fans acknowledging their team's impressive display. The victory not only secured their place in the next round of the FA Cup but also served as a testament to their ambitions for the season. Meanwhile, Exeter will look to regroup and focus on their league campaign, hoping to bounce back from this setback."

    "prompt": "The cost of putting a child through a 14-year private education in the UK stands at £286,000, research suggests.",
    "HWT": "It indicates average day school fees are now £13,194 per year and boarding fees cost an average of £30,369. Private schooling from primary age to A-levels totals £286,000 for a day place and £468,000 for a boarder, the report from Killik and Co finds. London remains the most expensive region, with an average day school place costing £15,500 per year. The north of England and Scotland were the cheapest, at £10,400 and £10,700 respectively. In a survey of 250 parents who privately educate their children, over a third (37.2%) said they saw private education as an \"investment priority\". Of those surveyed, 34% said the attraction of smaller class sizes was a major consideration. Almost a quarter said they sent their children to private school for \"the connections my children will get\" (24.8%). Another main reason was that \"either myself or a member of my family went there\" (18%). Sarah Lord, managing director of Killik financial planners, said: \"The cost of private education is eye-watering for many families. However, over a third of parents responded that investment in education is one of the best investments they can make. \"Of course, private education is not going to be viable for everybody. For some, it will make much more sense to opt for a good state school and invest the money elsewhere. \"Indeed, 14 years of day school fees from 2015 could be invested over this time to build a potential sum of around £800,000, which would help children later on in life, whether that be funding university, buying a house, or securing a comfortable retirement.\"",
    "MGT": "The cost of providing a 14-year private education for a child in the United Kingdom has reached an eye-watering £286,000, according to new research. This figure, which spans the full journey from primary school through to the end of secondary education, highlights the growing financial burden on families seeking to secure private education for their children.\n\nThe study reveals that tuition fees alone make up the bulk of this expense. Private schools across the UK have continued to raise fees annually, with the average cost now standing at approximately £20,000 per year for day school students. Boarding schools, which tend to be even more expensive, can push the annual figure significantly higher. Beyond tuition, additional costs such as uniforms, extracurricular activities, school trips, and transportation further contribute to the overall expense.\n\nExperts attribute the rising costs to inflation, increased operational expenses for schools, and growing demand for private education among families seeking smaller class sizes, specialized programs, and enhanced opportunities for their children. However, the financial strain has led many parents to reassess their options, with some opting for state schools or exploring scholarship opportunities to offset the expense.\n\nDespite the costs, private schools continue to be a popular choice for families aiming to provide their children with access to top-tier facilities and academic excellence. Data suggests that students from private schools often achieve higher exam results and gain admission to prestigious universities, reinforcing their appeal to parents willing to make significant financial sacrifices.\n\nAs tuition fees show no signs of slowing their upward trajectory, the debate around the affordability and accessibility of private education is expected to intensify. For many families, the decision to pursue private schooling has become a delicate balancing act between aspirations for their children’s futures and the realities of their financial constraints."

    "HWT": "The machine was first used to crack messages sent by Hitler and his generals on 5 February 1944. The celebration will bring together some of the machine's creators and operators at The National Museum of Computing (TNMOC). The machine's code-cracking prowess will be demonstrated on the day using the museum's rebuilt Colossus. Now widely recognised as the first electronic computer, Colossus was kept a secret for 30 years because of the sensitive work it did during World War Two to crack German codes. The work of the Colossus machines to decipher messages scrambled using the Lorenz enciphering machine that passed between the Wehrmacht's commanders is widely thought to have shortened the war and saved countless lives. Colossus was created by Post Office engineer Tommy Flowers, and his first prototype was built out of parts from telephone exchanges including 1,600 valves. Later versions used even more valves and by the end of the war 10 of the machines were in use in the UK. The celebrations will bring together some of the women who kept the different machines running as well as some of the engineers who built and maintained them. During wartime, about 550 people worked in the Bletchley Park unit that ran Colossus. Also attending will be some of the children of the machine's creators and operators. Most of the machines were broken up and the plans destroyed after the war in an attempt to keep the work secret and to conceal the fact Britain was still using two of the machines to read Soviet messages. \"The achievements of those who worked at Bletchley Park are humbling,\" said Tim Reynolds, chair of TNMOC. \"This day is in honour of all the men and women who worked on breaking the Lorenz cipher.\"",

The Colossus, known for its groundbreaking contributions during World War II, is hailed as the world’s first programmable digital electronic computer, designed to decrypt the Lorenz-encrypted messages used by the German military.\n\nOriginally developed in secrecy, the Colossus played a crucial role in the Allied war effort, providing invaluable intelligence that contributed to shortening the conflict and saving countless lives. Its creation marked a pivotal moment in technological advancement, laying the groundwork for modern computing and influencing generations of computer scientists and engineers.\n\nVisitors to Bletchley Park, the historic site where the codebreakers tirelessly worked during the war, were treated to a series of engaging activities and presentations. Enthusiasts and historians alike gathered to reflect on the remarkable achievements of this period, celebrating the ingenuity and perseverance of the team led by British engineer Tommy Flowers, who was instrumental in the development of the Colossus.\n\nThe event featured a live demonstration of a rebuilt Colossus, allowing attendees to witness firsthand the intricate mechanics and operations of this early computing marvel. Experts provided insights into the technical challenges overcome by Flowers and his team, highlighting the innovative spirit that drove them to success despite the limitations of the era.\n\nIn addition to the demonstrations, lectures and discussions explored the profound impact of Colossus on the future of technology, examining its legacy and influence on subsequent developments in computing. The anniversary celebration offered a unique opportunity to appreciate the historical significance of Bletchley Park and its contributions to technology and society.\n\nAs visitors left the grounds, they carried with them a deeper appreciation for the pioneering efforts that shaped the digital age. The 70th anniversary of Colossus served not only as a tribute to past achievements but also as an inspiration for future generations, emphasizing the enduring importance of innovation and collaboration in the pursuit of progress."

No-one at the cargo bay of Royal Jordanian Airlines expected to see a crowd of mourners arriving on their forecourt. With just a couple of hours notice, Kurds young and old turned out to pay tribute to a man from Chichester whom they had never met. \"This is not just a foreign war, this is a fight for humanity\", one told me. \"International solidarity\" they chant as they place flowers over the private ambulance carrying Ryan Lock's coffin. They hold their hands up in silent salute. To have a British man fight their cause, touches their hearts. A Kurdish mother kisses the ambulance and weeps as it drives away. Supporters of the YPJ female-fighting force paid tribute to Mr Lock, saying his memory would \"forever live on in our struggle for the freedom of Syria and our hope for change in the whole world\".

    "MGT": "The body of a British man who died while fighting against so-called Islamic State in Syria has returned to the UK, greeted by an outpouring of grief and admiration. The individual, whose name has not been disclosed in this report, had traveled to the war-torn region to join the fight against the extremist group, aligning himself with local forces battling to reclaim territory from IS militants.\n\nAs the coffin arrived at its destination, a crowd of supporters gathered to pay their respects, hailing the fallen fighter as a hero. Many carried flowers and signs bearing messages of gratitude and solidarity, recognizing the sacrifice made by the man in his efforts to confront the brutality and oppression of IS. Some attendees were visibly emotional, describing him as a courageous individual who gave his life in the fight against tyranny.\n\nThe Briton had reportedly joined Kurdish-led forces in northern Syria, a region that became a focal point in the international struggle against IS. These forces, including the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), have been instrumental in dismantling the group's so-called caliphate, but the conflict has come at a significant human cost. Volunteers from around the world, including the UK, have traveled to the region over the years to support the Kurdish fighters, often putting their lives at grave risk.\n\nFriends and family of the deceased spoke of their pride in his actions, describing him as someone deeply committed to the ideals of justice and freedom. “He believed in standing up for what was right, no matter the cost,” one mourner said. “He was willing to put himself on the line to help protect others from the horrors inflicted by IS.”\n\nWhile the man's death has reignited debates in the UK over the role of foreign fighters in overseas conflicts, for those gathered to honor him, the focus remained on his bravery and selflessness. Tributes poured in from across the country, with many hailing him as an example of moral conviction and sacrifice.\n\nThe return of his body to the UK serves as a somber reminder of the ongoing global fight against extremism and the personal toll it takes on those who choose to confront it head-on."

    "HWT": "The bird waddled on to the track between Egham and Ashford, Surrey, causing a back up towards Waterloo at around 07:30 BST. South West Trains said the swan was moved quickly but services were delayed by 30 minutes throughout the morning. A spokesman for the rail company apologised for the disruption. He said \"staff attended the site and moved the swan to safety\" but the incident caused further \"knock-on delays\", particularly between Clapham Junction and Waterloo.

    "MGT": "Rail commuters in London faced an unexpected hurdle this week as they attempted to navigate their journeys amidst ongoing delays at London Waterloo. Already grappling with disruptions due to essential maintenance works, travelers found themselves further inconvenienced by an unlikely culprit—a swan.\n\nThe elegant bird made an unscheduled appearance on the tracks, bringing additional chaos to the morning rush hour. As authorities scrambled to address the situation, the swan held its ground, seemingly unfazed by the commotion it was causing. Rail operators worked swiftly to resolve the issue, dispatching wildlife experts to coax the swan off the tracks and ensure its safety.\n\nCommuters, many of whom were already bracing for a challenging day due to the maintenance delays, expressed their frustration. “Just when you think things can’t get worse, a swan decides to join the party,” remarked one exasperated traveler. Social media was awash with bemused comments, as many saw the humor in the situation despite the inconvenience.\n\nThe incident serves as a reminder of the unpredictable nature of commuting in a bustling city like London. While rail operators continue their efforts to improve infrastructure and minimize disruptions, commuters are left to hope that their journeys will soon return to normal—minus any feathered interruptions."

    "HWT": "The Royal College of Midwives (RCM) and Public Heath Wales stressed the dangers of flu to pregnant women and reminded expectant mothers to get vaccinated. Pregnant women are more vulnerable to infections and cannot fight off flu as well as other people. Dr Richard Roberts, of Public Health Wales, said there can be \"severe complications\" for mothers and babies. Pregnant women who catch flu are more likely to deliver early, with an increased risk of stillbirth or illness for a baby in their first week. Helen Rogers, director of RCM, said it \"strongly recommends\" pregnant women have the vaccination, saying they can have it \"at any stage during their pregnancy\". \"We also urge midwives and other health professionals to have the vaccination to protect themselves, their family and the people they care for from infection as well,\" she added. Dr Richard Roberts, head of the vaccine preventable disease programme at Public Health Wales, said flu can be \"devastating for the woman and her unborn baby\". The annual flu vaccination programme aims to make sure the people who need it most get free protection each year, including those aged 65 and over and people with certain long-term health conditions, as well as pregnant women. All children aged two and three years old on 31 August 2016, and those in reception class, year one, two and three in school are also being offered protection with a nasal spray flu vaccine. Two and three-year-olds will get their spray at GP surgeries, while those up to year three will be offered the vaccine at school.",
    "MGT": "Health officials in Wales are urging pregnant women to take advantage of free flu vaccinations this winter to protect themselves and their unborn babies. Medical experts have emphasized the heightened risks posed by influenza during pregnancy, which can lead to severe complications for both mother and child.\n\nThe flu vaccine, offered free of charge to all pregnant women in Wales, is a critical measure in reducing the likelihood of serious illness. Pregnant women are more vulnerable to flu-related complications due to changes in their immune systems, heart, and lungs during pregnancy. Contracting the flu while pregnant can increase the risk of preterm birth, low birth weight, and, in severe cases, stillbirth.\n\nHealthcare providers have reiterated that the flu vaccine is safe at any stage of pregnancy and does not pose any risk to the developing baby. Additionally, they highlighted the added benefit of the vaccine in providing protection to newborns, as antibodies are passed on from the mother to the baby.\n\nDr. Sian Lewis, a leading public health official, stressed the importance of vaccination, particularly with the approach of colder months when flu cases typically surge. \"The flu virus can be extremely serious for pregnant women, but the vaccine offers a simple and effective way to stay protected,\" she said. \"We encourage all expectant mothers to make this a priority.\"\n\nMidwives and general practitioners across Wales are also playing a key role in promoting the flu jab by educating pregnant women about its benefits and addressing any concerns they may have. Health boards are working to ensure the vaccine is readily accessible, with appointments available at GP surgeries and community clinics.\n\nOfficials hope the campaign will lead to higher vaccination rates, ensuring the safety and well-being of mothers and babies throughout the flu season."

Some of the other muppets in the collection include early versions of Cookie Monster and Oscar the Grouch. Henson's oldest puppet, Pierre the French Rat, was also donated. Jane Henson said the original characters provided five minutes of fun each night after the local news where they mostly mimed to popular music. \"I think people realized that if you put Kermit's face up there, it was just as powerful - we were mostly just doing it to entertain ourselves,\" she said. The Smithsonian already has a familiar Kermit the Frog puppet made famous on Sesame Street and The Muppet Show.

    "HWT": "Educating is back for a fourth series aiming to show real life in schools using a fly on the wall format. The last three series have been praised for showing an insight into what education is like in Britain. But there's also been criticism they focussed too much on bullying, bad language and teen pregnancies. As someone who was once a teacher (all be it a substitute) I can tell you there is just as much bad language in a staff room as there is in the common room. But try not offending someone in 2014. With that in mind the producers have planned a fourth series and to tick another regional box they've decided to head to Wales for the first time. The location will be Willows High School in Cardiff where the head teacher has said she's simply \"delighted\" that the programme will be showing off their high standards. Over the last few years the school has become one of the most improving schools in Wales. Head teacher Joy Ballard said: \"Willows has been on an incredible journey over the past three years and has been transformed from one of the worst performing schools in the country to a school that we are very proud of.\" The nine-episode series will air in autumn. Executive producer at Channel 4 David Clews said: \"You can really feel the charm and character of the place as soon as you walk through the gates and start talking to the students. \"We really are excited about making Educating in Wales.\" Channel 4 has been pumping millions of pounds into it's documentary making in the last few years and the Educating series has certainly been a success. Commissioning editor, David Brindley, said the series \"promises to unearth more inspirational, humorous and moving stories from the corridors of this characterful Cardiff school\".",
    "MGT": "Channel 4 has embarked on a new chapter in its ongoing mission to bring fresh perspectives and diverse narratives to the British public. With its latest focus on Cardiff, the broadcaster continues its commitment to spotlighting the unique stories and cultures that make up the UK. Following successful ventures into Essex, Yorkshire, and East London, Cardiff is set to be the next region to share its vibrant culture and local tales with a broader audience.\n\nChannel 4's move to Cardiff is a strategic decision aimed at broadening its content and ensuring that underrepresented areas have a platform. The Welsh capital, known for its rich history and dynamic cultural scene, offers a plethora of stories waiting to be told. From its iconic landmarks like Cardiff Castle to its thriving arts and music scene, the city presents a tapestry of narratives that reflect both modern and traditional elements of Welsh life.\n\nThe broadcaster plans to collaborate with local creators, writers, and filmmakers, ensuring that the stories told are authentic and resonate with the local community. This initiative is part of Channel 4's wider strategy to decentralize its operations and tap into regional talent across the UK. By focusing on Cardiff, Channel 4 not only highlights the city's unique character but also invests in its creative industry, providing opportunities for local talent to shine on a national stage.\n\nCardiff's selection follows equally successful projects in other regions. The Essex project explored the complexities and charms of life in the southeast, while the Yorkshire series delved into the heart of Northern England, capturing its landscapes and local stories. More recently, the East London initiative celebrated the area's diversity and vibrant culture. Each of these projects has been instrumental in showcasing the unique aspects of these regions, bringing local stories to a wider audience.\n\nAs Channel 4 turns its lens towards Cardiff, anticipation is building about what stories will emerge. Viewers can expect a series that not only entertains but also educates and inspires, providing a window into the lives of those who call Cardiff home.

    "HWT": "Where can you have a day out for less than £25? The BBC's Price of Football study has analysed data from 223 clubs across Britain and Europe to find out how much is costs supporters to follow their team. Overall, 36% of ticket prices in the division went up compared to last year's study - the biggest percentage increase across the men's leagues in the UK. The average cost of the cheapest matchday ticket has gone up to £22.11 - a six-year high - while the most expensive matchday tickets average £36.13. The average season ticket prices are at their lowest since 2013 - with the cheapest averaging £322.83 and the most expensive averaging £568.15. A £30 away ticket cap was introduced in the Premier League at the start of the season, in the same year that a record £8bn TV rights deal came into effect. With no cap in the Championship, the average price of the most expensive away ticket is £31.57 - more than £2 dearer than the top flight. However, the average in the cheapest away ticket category has fallen by 9% to £20.98 since last year. Twelve Championship clubs offer away tickets for more than £30: Aston Villa, Barnsley, Brentford, Brighton, Derby, Ipswich, Leeds, Newcastle Norwich, Nottingham Forest, QPR and Sheffield Wednesday.",
    "MGT": "Several Championship clubs are reportedly charging higher prices for away tickets than some teams in the Premier League, sparking frustration among traveling fans. With the Premier League capping away tickets at £30 per game, some second-tier clubs have set their prices significantly higher, leading to criticism over the growing financial burden on supporters.\n\nClubs such as Leeds United, Sunderland, and Norwich City are among those whose away ticket prices have exceeded the capped Premier League rate. Fans traveling to these Championship clubs have reported paying upwards of £35, with some matches even approaching the £40 mark. This disparity has reignited debates about the affordability and fairness of ticket pricing in English football.\n\nSupporter groups and fan organizations have voiced their concerns, pointing out that many Championship fans face additional financial pressures when following their teams on the road, including transportation and accommodation costs. They argue that higher ticket prices in the second tier are unjustifiable, particularly given the league’s lower revenue compared to the Premier League.\n\nThe Football Supporters' Association (FSA) has called for a standardized cap on away ticket prices across all leagues in England, urging the Football League to adopt a similar approach to the Premier League’s policy. Clubs, however, maintain that ticket prices are necessary to sustain operations and compete financially, especially in a league where parachute payments and financial disparities heavily influence spending.\n\nThe debate continues as fans demand greater transparency and fairness in ticket pricing, highlighting the growing divide between football’s governing bodies and its loyal supporters."

    "HWT": "Two nightclub owners and two members of the band playing as the fire began are accused of \"negligent homicide\". A police inquiry in the city of Santa Maria found that the fire was triggered by fireworks used by the band. Most of the victims died after inhaling the toxic smoke produced when ceiling insulation foam caught fire. Investigators also criticised the fact that the venue only had one exit. The police investigation identified 16 potential accused, of which eight have been charged. Four people were charged earlier for obstructing the course of justice, including two firemen accused of hiding evidence that the club's fire licence had expired. Nightclub owners Mauro Hoffmann and Elissandro Spohr and two members of the Gurizada Fandangueira band, Marcelo de Jesus dos Santos and Luciano Bonilha Leao, face trial for manslaughter. Prosecutor Joel Dutra said the four men knew of the possible impact of their actions and failed to act. \"To die through the inhalation of toxic fumes is a cruel way of dying,\" he said. \"The reason they died was the search for profit, through the use of inadequate fireworks and highly inflammable foam on the nightclub's ceiling.\" The police report published in March said dozens of eyewitnesses reported seeing the singer on stage holding the firework which triggered the blaze. Attempts by the singer and a security guard to extinguish the fire failed when the extinguisher they used did not work, the witnesses said. Many said that the security guards at the club at first tried to stop people from leaving the club, which was found to be overcrowded. The fire, and the lack of safety precautions at the venue, have prompted widespread concern about Brazil's ability to host major sporting events in the next four years.

The horrific event unfolded in the southern city of Santa Maria, leaving a deep scar on the nation and prompting widespread calls for justice and improved safety measures in public venues.\n\nThe fire broke out in the early hours of January 27, during a university party attended by a large number of young people. Eyewitnesses reported that the blaze started when a member of the performing band lit a flare, which quickly ignited the club’s flammable ceiling foam, designed for soundproofing. The resulting inferno spread at an alarming rate, creating thick smoke and intense heat, which overwhelmed the club's patrons and staff.\n\nSurvivors recounted scenes of chaos and panic as they struggled to find exits in the dark, smoke-filled environment. Many were trapped, unable to escape due to the club's inadequate emergency exits and overcrowding, factors that have since come under intense scrutiny.\n\nThe individuals charged include the club’s owners, Elissandro Spohr and Mauro Hoffmann, as well as two members of the band Gurizada Fandangueira, whose pyrotechnics are believed to have triggered the fire. Prosecutors have built their case on allegations of gross negligence, citing the club’s failure to adhere to fire safety regulations and the decision to allow the use of pyrotechnics in an enclosed space.\n\nThe charges have brought a measure of solace to the grieving families, who have been vocal in their demands for accountability. The tragedy has also sparked a nationwide reevaluation of safety standards in entertainment venues, with authorities implementing stricter regulations to prevent such disasters in the future.\n\nAs the legal proceedings unfold, the Brazilian public remains vigilant, hoping for a resolution that will honor the memory of the victims and ensure that such a catastrophe is never repeated. The case has become a stark reminder of the importance of rigorous safety measures and the devastating consequences of their neglect."

NHS Scotland has emphasized the importance of getting the seasonal flu jab to reduce the severity of symptoms and prevent further strain on healthcare services. Officials also warned that this year's flu season could be particularly challenging, as it coincides with ongoing pressures from other respiratory illnesses and the lingering effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nDr. Jane Morrison, a public health expert, noted that flu can have serious consequences, especially for those at higher risk. \"We are seeing more cases of severe flu requiring hospital treatment, and vaccination is key to protecting yourself and others,\" she said. Morrison urged Scots to take advantage of free flu vaccinations available to eligible groups, including pregnant women, people over 65, and those with chronic health conditions.\n\nCommunity health campaigns are being rolled out across the country to raise awareness about flu vaccination and encourage uptake. Officials hope proactive measures will help mitigate the impact of the virus and prevent further hospitalizations during the winter months. As flu cases continue to rise, the message from healthcare professionals is clear: vaccination saves lives and helps protect the wider community."

    "HWT": "The man was stopped near the border with Laos after avoiding a police checkpoint. The driver told police he had been paid 15,000 baht ($490; Â£300) to transport the cubs. Thailand is one of the centres of the illegal trade in tigers. Tiger body parts are prized in many parts of Asia for their reputed medicinal properties. The cubs were found packed into eight plastic crates. The driver now faces the possibility of a four-year jail term or a fine of 40,000 baht ($1,300; Â£800) on wildlife-smuggling charges. The animals are now in the care of wildlife officials. Only six subspecies of tiger remain in the wild, with fewer than 1,000 tigers thought to be left in each group. Earlier this year, heads of police and customs from 13 countries with wild tiger populations agreed to tighten controls and improve cross-border co-operation to combat smuggling.",
    "MGT": "Thai authorities have detained a lorry driver after discovering 16 tiger cubs concealed in the back of his vehicle. The arrest took place during a routine checkpoint inspection in Nakhon Phanom province near the border with Laos. Officials uncovered the young tigers hidden in small cages, sparking concerns about illegal wildlife trafficking in the region.\n\nThe driver, whose identity has not been disclosed, reportedly told authorities he was unaware of the cargo's contents and claimed he had been hired to transport the goods to an undisclosed location. Investigators are now working to trace the origins of the tiger cubs and identify the individuals responsible for the smuggling operation.\n\nThailand has long been a hotspot for wildlife trafficking, with endangered species often targeted for trade due to high demand in neighboring countries and beyond. Conservationists have applauded the arrest as a step forward in combating the illicit wildlife trade, but they stress the need for stricter enforcement and harsher penalties to deter future crimes."

    "HWT": "Centre-back Cooper, 21, hopes to help the Royals to an FA Cup fifth-round upset against West Brom on Saturday. \"My mum looks for the reviews more than I do, but I try not to get too involved in what people are writing about me,\" he told BBC Radio Berkshire. Cooper, who has been with the club since 14, hopes to emulate Reading's semi-final run from last season. \"I want to make the fans and club proud,\" he added. \"I do hear about what people are writing and saying about me, but I don't really want to think about it too much. \"I always feel I can do better and that I have a lot of room for improvement. I think I still have a long way to go in my game.\" Cooper, who has made 14 appearances this season, signed a new contract at the Madejski Stadium in October, keeping him at the club until the summer of 2018. \"Last season, the FA Cup run helped us gain confidence in our league performances,\" he said. \"We're hoping we can do the same again this year.\"",
    "MGT": "In the world of professional football, players often face intense scrutiny from fans and critics alike. However, for Reading defender Jake Cooper, the opinions that matter most come from a much closer source—his mother. In a candid interview, Cooper revealed that his mother is far more invested in the reviews of his performances than he is.\n\nCooper, who has been a key player for Reading, shared that while he prefers to focus on his game and the training regimen, his mother diligently keeps track of the media commentary surrounding his matches. \"She reads all the articles and watches the highlights,\" Cooper said with a smile, acknowledging her dedication to following his career closely.\n\nDespite the pressure that often accompanies public reviews, Cooper appreciates his mother's involvement. \"It's nice to know she's watching out for me,\" he added, expressing gratitude for her unwavering support. Her feedback, he admitted, sometimes resonates more than that of professional analysts.\n\nThis family dynamic offers a refreshing perspective in the high-stakes world of football, where external opinions can often overshadow personal growth and development. For Cooper, maintaining a focus on personal improvement and team success takes precedence over external evaluations. Yet, having his mother's keen eye on his performances provides a comforting balance between professional ambitions and familial support, reinforcing the importance of home-grown encouragement in his athletic journey."

    "prompt": "The former speaker of Niger's parliament, Hama Amadou, will not be released from prison to campaign for elections, Niger's court of appeals has said.",
    "HWT": "Mr Amadou was arrested in November 2015 for baby-trafficking charges after fleeing to France for a year. He filed for provisional release to run in the elections but Judge Ibrahim Harouna denied the appeal on Monday. Mr Amadou says the accusations against him are politically motivated. The Constitutional Court on Saturday approved him to stand in elections. The court of appeals did not give a reason for the verdict. Mr Amadou's second wife was arrested in June 2014 along with 16 others, accused of illegally buying new-borns from \"baby factories\" in south-east Nigeria - where babies are allegedly sold for thousands of dollars. All denied any wrongdoing. Mr Amadou - a leading opposition presidential candidate - was then arrested in November 2015 after living in exile in France. Mr Amadou's supporters say the charges were fabricated to prevent him from running against President Mahamadou Issouffou in the 21 February presidential election. \"With this rejection of conditional release, the regime succeeded with its first knock-out blow,\" his lawyer, Souley Oumara, said. The BBC's Abdourahmane Dia says that Mr Amadou now has five days to appeal against the decision - or risk following the election from his prison cell. Tensions have been rising in Niger ahead of the elections. On Monday, lawyers in the country staged a 24-hour strike to oppose what they call the arbitrary arrest of government opponents. In December, President Mahamadou Issoufou said his government had foiled a plot to overthrow him. He is the favourite to win elections, though critics accuse him of becoming increasingly authoritarian as the vote nears. The campaign for the presidential election is due to start on 31 January, with 15 candidates vying for the presidency.",
    "MGT": "In a significant development in Niger's political landscape, the court of appeals has ruled that Hama Amadou, the former speaker of the country's parliament, will remain in prison and will not be granted temporary release to participate in the upcoming electoral campaign. This decision has intensified the already heated political atmosphere as the country approaches its elections.\n\nHama Amadou, a prominent political figure and key opposition leader, has been a central figure in Nigerien politics for years. His imprisonment has been a contentious issue, with his supporters arguing that his detention is politically motivated, aimed at preventing him from challenging the ruling party's hold on power. Amadou's arrest and subsequent incarceration stem from charges linked to his alleged involvement in a baby-trafficking scandal, a charge that he and his supporters vehemently deny, labeling it as a smear campaign orchestrated by political adversaries.\n\nThe court's decision to deny Amadou's release has sparked a wave of reactions across the political spectrum. Supporters of Amadou have expressed disappointment and frustration, arguing that the ruling denies them a fair chance to campaign and promote their political agenda. They assert that the judicial decision is a direct affront to democratic principles and undermines the fairness of the electoral process.\n\nOn the other hand, the ruling has been welcomed by some segments who argue that the law should take its course and that no individual should be above it, regardless of their political stature. They urge for the respect of judicial decisions and emphasize the importance of maintaining stability and order in the country during this critical period.\n\nAs Niger inches closer to its elections, the political scene remains tense, with the court's decision likely to have significant implications on the dynamics of power and influence. The absence of Amadou from the campaign trail will undoubtedly reshape strategies and alliances, as parties and candidates adjust to the evolving political landscape. The international community is closely monitoring the situation, urging for a peaceful and transparent electoral process."

    "HWT": "Zhang Kai admitted to various crimes including disturbing social order in a broadcast on Thursday. He has been helping defend Christians resisting government orders to remove crosses from buildings. China says it guarantees religious freedom but there are concerns about a crackdown on Christian activities. On Friday a pastor was jailed for refusing to remove a cross from his church's roof. The authorities have justified the tearing down of crosses by saying they break planning rules. Zhang Kai was arrested last year shortly before a planned meeting with the US envoy on religious freedoms. In the broadcast, Mr Zhang said he had assisted the Christians because he wanted wealth and fame. \"I really regret doing these things, I feel very remorseful,\" he said. \"These things violated China's law and violated my personal integrity as a lawyer, and they harmed societal structure and national security.\" China frequently airs confessions from high-profile suspects on television. Condemning the broadcast, a US State Department spokesman said \"such confessions are counter to the standards of a rule of law. \"We urge China to release Zhang and others detained for seeking to peacefully uphold the freedom of religion guaranteed in China's constitution.\"",
    "MGT": "The United States has expressed strong concerns over the recent broadcast of a purported confession by a prominent Chinese lawyer on state-run television, calling it a violation of fundamental principles of justice and the rule of law. The lawyer, known for his advocacy on human rights issues in China, appeared in what many critics have described as a coerced statement, raising questions about the fairness of his treatment and the transparency of legal proceedings in the country.\n\nU.S. officials have condemned the practice, asserting that public confessions under questionable circumstances undermine due process and the independence of the judiciary. \"Such actions are deeply troubling and inconsistent with international norms,\" a State Department spokesperson said. \"They run counter to the principles of the rule of law and raise serious concerns about the protection of individual rights in China.\"\n\nHuman rights organizations have also criticized the televised confession, suggesting it may have been obtained under duress. The incident has reignited global scrutiny over China's handling of dissent and its treatment of lawyers and activists who challenge state policies.\n\nThe Chinese government has defended the practice, maintaining that the confession aligns with its legal framework. However, the move has drawn fresh international attention to the broader issue of judicial transparency and human rights in the country, further straining relations between Beijing and Washington."

    "prompt": "Australians have one of the highest life expectancies in the world and are living longer without any disability, a new report says.",
    "HWT": "They are better educated than before but fewer people own their own homes, the government welfare report said. The report found that most Australians were doing well but major challenges remained for Indigenous Australians. The disabled, people suffering mental illness and domestic violence victims were also faring less well. The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) report, issued every two years, says that a baby born between 2011 and 2013 can expect to live to 80.1 years if it is a boy and 84.3 if it is a girl. The national snapshot said 15% of the current population was aged 65 and over and by 2054 this was projected to increase to 21%, or 8.4 million people. About 3% of the population is Indigenous, it added. The report showed most children were doing well and most young people were studying or working, said Acting AIHW Director Kerry Flanagan. \"Adult participation in the labour force is higher than 20 years ago, and while some people are staying at work longer, after retirement, the majority of older Australians are not using aged care services,\" said Ms Flanagan. \"On the other hand, we see that 1 in 37 children are receiving child protection services, around 2 million Australians, mostly women, have experienced partner violence since the age of 15, youth unemployment exceeds 13%, and there's been little improvement in the proportion of young people who are not fully engaged in employment, education or training.\" About 28% of the population was born overseas, with the largest number coming from the UK, followed by New Zealand and China. That compares with 24% 10 years ago.",
    "MGT": "Australians are enjoying some of the longest and healthiest lives in the world, according to a new report that highlights the country's impressive life expectancy and quality of life. The findings reveal that Australians not only live longer but are also spending more of their later years free from disability and major health issues.\n\nThe report, which analyzed health and longevity data, places Australia among the global leaders in life expectancy. It attributes this achievement to a combination of factors, including access to high-quality healthcare, a strong public health system, and widespread awareness of healthy lifestyle practices. This success is also reflected in the nation's ability to delay the onset of age-related disabilities, allowing more Australians to lead active and fulfilling lives well into their senior years.\n\nExperts note that the country's focus on preventative healthcare has played a significant role in these outcomes. Programs aimed at reducing smoking rates, promoting physical activity, and encouraging balanced diets have had a measurable impact on the population's health. Additionally, advances in medical technology and treatments have improved the management of chronic conditions, further contributing to the overall well-being of Australians.\n\nDespite these promising trends, the report also underscores the need for continued investment in health initiatives to ensure these gains are sustained. With an aging population, the demand for healthcare services is expected to grow, and addressing disparities in access to care will be crucial. Indigenous Australians, for example, continue to face significant health challenges, with life expectancy rates that lag behind the national average.\n\nNevertheless, the report paints a positive picture of Australia's health landscape, revealing a nation that not only values longevity but also prioritizes quality of life. As Australians continue to embrace healthier habits and benefit from medical advancements, their reputation for leading long, active lives remains well-earned."

Aside from a small scar on his thumb, Mr Nadeau says he was unscathed and the wedding proceeded. Storm clouds had gathered behind him at the ceremony on 8 July, he said, and his daughter saw lightning strike the ground nearby. \"I had the microphone and the shock jumped into the sound system and my hand just lit up and I saw the spark,\" he told the CBC. \"And I'm looking at my hand and it's all flared up… It was like I was holding a lightning bolt in my hand, it was amazing.\" Everyone was stunned at first, but that didn't stop the happy couple from continuing with the festivities. \"It was a beautiful wedding,\" Mr Nadeau's wife, Maggy Thomas, told the CBC. \"But that was pretty terrifying for a second.\" Mr Nadeau says he's a lucky-unlucky man - in 2015, a cruise ship he was working on near the Falkland Islands caught fire, and he was rescued by the British Royal Air Force. \"I've had lots of brushes with death,\" said Mr Nadeau. \"But death keeps ignoring me.\"",

What started as a heartfelt toast quickly became the talk of the evening, leaving guests with a story they won't soon forget.\n\nAs the father of the bride, Richard Johnson, stood to deliver his much-anticipated speech, he decided to incorporate a bit of humor and theatrics to lighten the mood. Holding a wireless microphone, he began recounting fond memories of Emily's childhood and sharing anecdotes about the couple's journey together. Guests laughed and applauded as Richard's jokes landed perfectly, and his genuine love for his daughter shone through.\n\nHowever, midway through the speech, an unexpected technical glitch with the sound system sent a mild electrical jolt through the microphone, causing Richard to jerk back in surprise. Gasps filled the room as he regained his composure and quipped, \"Well, I guess that's what they mean by a shocking speech!\" The crowd erupted into laughter, relieved that the incident was minor and Richard was unharmed.\n\nThe rest of the ceremony proceeded without a hitch, though the electrifying moment became a running joke for the remainder of the evening. Guests praised Richard for his quick wit and ability to turn an awkward situation into a memorable highlight of the day.\n\nAs the newlyweds danced under the twinkling lights that night, it was clear that the love and joy surrounding the event had far outshined the brief technical hiccup. For Emily and James, it was a day they—and their guests—would never forget."

    "prompt": "The Dutch government has announced that it will ban the use of the mild narcotic khat.",
    "HWT": "It is a leaf-based drug that, when chewed, releases juices that act as natural stimulants and is popular with the Somali community. The Netherlands is used as a hub to transport khat imported from the Horn of Africa to other European countries. There are concerns that the drug can cause psychosis or bring on schizophrenia. The BBC's Anna Holligan in the Netherlands says the country has a traditionally liberal approach to soft drugs. However, a Dutch government report cited noise, litter and the perceived public threat posed by men who chew khat as some of the reasons for outlawing the drug. \"I'm involved in the ban because it appears to cause serious problems, particularly in the Somali community,\" Dutch immigration minister Gerd Leers is quoted as saying by Radio Netherlands. Source: www.talktofrank.com He said that 10% of Somali men in the Netherlands were badly affected by the drug. \"They are lethargic and refuse to co-operate with the government or take responsibility for themselves or their families,\" he said. Very few Dutch nationals use the drug, which is mainly chewed by people from Somalia, Ethiopia, Kenya and Yemen. Our reporter says more than 25,000 Somalis now live in the Netherlands and as the population arrived, the use of khat in the country grew. At the moment it is legally imported via Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport four times a week. Khat leaves need to be fresh, otherwise they lose their potency. Last year, khat worth around $18m (£11.6m) was brought into the Netherlands. The use of the stimulant is banned in the US, Canada and several other European countries. But it is still available in the UK where it is legally sold in a small number of grocery stores.",
    "MGT": "The Dutch government has officially announced its decision to ban the use of khat, a mild narcotic commonly consumed in certain communities. The move comes amid growing concerns over the social and health implications of the substance, which is predominantly used by individuals of East African and Middle Eastern origin.\n\nKhat, a plant whose leaves are chewed for their stimulating effects, has long been a contentious issue in the Netherlands. While its use has been legal in the country, the government has faced increasing pressure to address the potential risks associated with the substance. Critics argue that khat consumption can lead to addiction, social isolation, and other negative consequences, particularly for vulnerable groups within immigrant communities.\n\nThe decision to impose the ban, according to officials, was based on studies highlighting the adverse effects of khat. The government also cited concerns about its role in exacerbating unemployment and integration challenges among certain populations. Authorities believe that restricting access to the substance will help address these issues and promote public health and social cohesion.\n\nAlthough khat is not classified as a hard drug, its stimulant properties have raised alarms in several European countries, many of which have already outlawed its use. The Netherlands, known for its liberal drug policies, had been one of the few countries where khat remained legal. However, the latest move signals a shift in its approach toward substances with potential societal impacts.\n\nThe ban has sparked mixed reactions. Supporters, including health experts and community leaders, have welcomed the decision, stating that it is a necessary step in protecting public welfare. On the other hand, critics argue that the prohibition could marginalize communities that traditionally use khat as part of their cultural practices.\n\nThe government has pledged to work closely with affected communities to ensure a smooth transition and provide support for those who may struggle to adapt to the new policy. The ban is expected to come into effect in the coming months."

Etsy, which became a public company in 2015, has struggled to turn a profit. Competition has also mounted from other firms, including Amazon, which has launched its own handicraft market. The two rounds of layoffs total about 230, or roughly 22% of the firm's workforce at the end of 2016.

The company made $365m in revenue in 2016, but it has posted a loss every year since at least 2012, according to its annual report. At least one of its shareholders has pressured the firm to consider selling itself.

But Gormley said all art should be \"unsettling\" and his work was \"nothing to do with suicide\". The work is part of a sculpture park being created on the campus. One student said: \"I really did think it was someone who was going to jump off a building.\" Gormley is one the UK's leading artists and is probably best known for his Angel of the North. In defending the UEA installation, he said: \"These works are nothing to do with suicide, they're actually to do with life and they're placed on the skyline in a way to make us think about space and distance. \"Universities are places where people spend a lot of time thinking about the thoughts of others, \"I think it's a wonderful place to balance that intellectual life with an object that is silent, it doesn't need to be read.

While Gormley’s works are celebrated for their thought-provoking engagement with environment and identity, this particular piece has faced criticism from some quarters. Concerns have been raised about the visual impact of the statues, with detractors arguing that their placement could evoke distress or discomfort. Others have questioned whether the figures, positioned high above ground, are an unnecessary distraction or even a potential safety hazard.\n\nIn response, Gormley has defended his vision, emphasizing the importance of art’s ability to challenge perceptions and encourage dialogue. “Art is meant to provoke,” he stated in a recent interview. “These figures are a reflection of humanity’s precarious position in the modern world, both physically and emotionally. They are an invitation to look up, to consider our place and our connection to the spaces we inhabit.”\n\nThe sculptor, whose celebrated works include the monumental \"Angel of the North\" and \"Event Horizon,\" has long been known for installations that spark conversation and occasionally controversy. Supporters of \"Edge\" argue that the statues are a profound commentary on the fragility of human existence, particularly in the context of academia and intellectual exploration.

It is presently short of a 300-order target. Currently, firm orders are 243 and there has not been one since last September. It is also $2bn (£1.29bn) over budget.

Invest NI chief executive Alastair Hamilton, who also attended the Paris launch, said:  \"I believe they will kick on from today.

Nobody's dead - we're playing football. \"The players are motivated to win games and so am I.\" Burnley welcome Hull to Turf Moor on Saturday, with Steven Reid likely to be available after six weeks out with a groin injury. \"Sometimes you've got be in the bottom of the valley to see the top of the mountain,\" added Dyche. \"By no means are we at the bottom of the valley because it's a great journey for us.\" Burnley, Championship runners-up last season, spent modestly in the summer and have concentrated on improving the club's infrastructure, something Dyche says they do not regret despite their struggles on the pitch. \"My job as manager depend on winning games,\" he said. \"I'm not naive to that but there has to be a balance to how this club goes about it. \"We had a supersonic journey last year to the Premier League so all the things that should be in place that are at other clubs were not in place.\" Burnley were beaten 3-0 at Arsenal last Saturday and Dyche revealed Gunners' manager Arsene Wenger invited him to his office after the game. \"We had a good chat about everything,\" he said. \"We'd had as many key passes into the box as they had at the stage of the season and we spoke about that. \"The defining moment is we don't have (an Alexis) Sanchez - he didn't want to loan him to us.\"",

The experienced manager is keen to remind players and supporters alike that football seasons are long and often unpredictable, with early struggles not necessarily indicative of how the campaign will ultimately unfold.\n\nBurnley, newly promoted to the Premier League this season, has faced tough opposition in the opening weeks.

However, Dyche remains confident in his players’ ability to adapt to the demands of top-flight football and believes that consistent hard work will eventually pay off.\n\n\"The mentality is strong,\" Dyche added. \"We know what this league demands, and we're building a foundation to compete at this level. The important thing is to keep improving every day and trust the process. We've been here before, and we know what it takes to turn things around.\"\n\nFans have been encouraged by Dyche's steadfast approach, with many pointing to his ability to motivate and organize squads under pressure as a hallmark of his managerial philosophy. Burnley's resilience has been a defining trait in recent years, and Dyche is confident it will shine through once again.\n\nAs Burnley prepare for their next match, Dyche’s calm demeanor and unwavering faith in his players serve as a reminder that patience and perseverance are often the keys to success in football's most competitive league."

    "HWT": "Exeter's Campagnaro has started all Italy's 2016 Six Nations games and scored two tries on their 2014 visit to Cardiff. Twice-capped Zebre centre Giulio Bisegni, 23, has been called up. Italy earlier lost Edoardo Padovani, Lorenzo Cittadini and George Biagi through injuries suffered in defeat by Ireland. It means the Azzurri must make at least four changes with fly-half Padovani, prop Cittadini and lock Biagi joining Campagnaro on the sidelines. Racing92 prop Martin Castrogiovanni, 34, has been recalled to the 28-man squad following suspension. Perpignan fly-half Tommy Allen is also called up alongside uncapped pair Jacopo Sarto and Tommaso Castello. Italy will be playing their final Six Nations game under coach Jacques Brunel, with Harlequins boss and former Ireland full-back Conor O'Shea expected to take over.

    "MGT": "Italy's national rugby team has been dealt a significant setback ahead of their upcoming match against Wales, as key player Michele Campagnaro has been ruled out due to injury. The experienced centre, known for his dynamic play and leadership on the field, has been an integral part of the squad. His absence is expected to have a considerable impact on Italy's strategy as they prepare to face a formidable Welsh side.\n\nCampagnaro has been sidelined with a leg injury sustained during training, which medical staff have deemed serious enough to prevent him from participating in the crucial fixture. The injury not only disrupts Italy's plans for the match against Wales but also poses a challenge for the team as they look to maintain their competitive edge in the tournament.\n\nIn light of Campagnaro's absence, the Italian coaching staff is now tasked with finding a suitable replacement who can fill the void left by the seasoned centre. The team remains optimistic and is focusing on adapting their gameplay to counter the strong Welsh lineup, hoping to overcome this latest hurdle in their campaign."

    "HWT": "Dismaland opened in Weston-super-Mare a week ago but tickets only went on sale on Tuesday after website problems. Dozens have now appeared on eBay and StubHub with some being sold for many times the face value of £3. A spokesman for the artist warned fans not to buy the touted tickets and to only buy from the official site. On Wednesday, tickets for the show were on sale for between £30 and £1,000 on eBay and an average of about £40 on StubHub. For the past week, visitors have had to queue outside the Tropicana, where the exhibition is based, while issues with online ticketing were resolved. The official Dismaland site went down several times as tickets for the first week went on sale on Tuesday. Those tickets quickly sold out. The show is due to run for another five weeks with further batches of tickets being sold on the official website. The Dismaland exhibition is a dark take on theme parks with a nod to Disneyland, featuring work by more than 50 artists including Bristolian Banksy. Among the exhibits are a distorted mermaid, a dilapidated fairy castle and a boat pond where all the boats are filled with models of migrants, as well as paintings and a beach ball hovering above upturned knives.",
    "MGT": "Visitors to Banksy’s latest exhibition will now face ID checks at the entrance after tickets for the event were found being resold on auction websites for as much as £1,000. The unexpected move comes as organizers aim to crack down on profiteering and ensure genuine fans have access to the exclusive showcase.\n\nThe exhibition, which has drawn significant attention for its secrecy and mystery, issued tickets through a controlled process to prevent scalping. However, reports of inflated prices online prompted swift action from the artist’s team. Attendees will now be required to present identification that matches the name on their ticket upon arrival.\n\nA spokesperson for the exhibition called the resale of tickets “deeply disappointing,” emphasizing that the event was intended to remain accessible to a broad audience rather than becoming a commodity for exploitation. They also warned that any tickets purchased through unofficial channels would be invalid, leaving buyers potentially unable to enter.\n\nBanksy, known for his subversive and anti-establishment artwork, has yet to comment directly on the situation. Fans, however, have voiced support for the crackdown, with many expressing frustration at opportunists attempting to profit from the resale market.\n\nThe event continues to draw massive interest, with tickets selling out almost immediately after their release. Organizers are urging prospective visitors to remain vigilant and only purchase tickets through authorized platforms."

    "prompt": "The dress worn by Marilyn Monroe as she sang \"Happy Birthday Mr President\" to John F Kennedy has been sold at auction for $4.8m (Â£3.9m).",
    "HWT": "The figure-hugging Jean Louis gown, with 2,500 crystals, was bought by the Ripley's Believe It or Not museum chain, exceeding the $3m guide price. The company's vice president said it was \"most iconic piece of pop culture that there is\". Monroe died from a drug overdose just three months after the performance. The sultry rendition for President Kennedy's 45th birthday at a 1962 Democratic fundraiser at New York's Madison Square was one of her last public appearances. President Kennedy was shot dead a year later. The dress, which the auction house said was so tight she had to be sewn into it, had previously been bought at auction for $1.3m in 1999 by the late business mogul and collector Martin Zweig. The sum raised is likely to set a new world record for the most expensive dress sold at auction. Marilyn Monroe's billowing white dress from the Seven Year Itch sold for $4.6 million (plus $1m in commission) in 2011. The largest collection of the screen star's possessions ever offered for auction is being sold by Julien's auction house in Beverly Hills over three days. Also sold on Thursday was the cocktail dress she wore in \"Some Like it Hot\", which fetched $450,000. Many of the 1,000 lots come from the estate of her acting coach, Lee Strasberg, who became a close friend of the actress. She bequeathed her personal effects and clothing to him in her will.",

The sale, which took place at Julien's Auctions in Los Angeles, attracted considerable attention from collectors and enthusiasts alike, eager to own a piece of one of the most memorable moments in American history.\n\nMonroe's performance at Madison Square Garden on May 19, 1962, has been etched in the annals of time, not only for her breathy, intimate delivery but also for the dazzling gown she wore. Designed by Jean Louis, the dress is renowned for its figure-hugging silhouette and intricate rhinestone-studded details, which famously gave the illusion that Monroe was wearing little more than glimmering diamonds. The dress was so tight that Monroe had to be sewn into it, adding to the allure and mystique surrounding the performance.\n\nThe auction attracted global interest, with bidders vying for the chance to own an artifact that encapsulates the glamour and intrigue of Monroe's life and her connection with Kennedy. The final bid exceeded expectations, surpassing previous sales of Monroe memorabilia, including personal items and costumes from her films.\n\nThe buyer, whose identity remains undisclosed, now possesses a piece of history that symbolizes not only Monroe's enduring legacy as a cultural icon but also the indelible connection between Hollywood and politics during the 1960s. The sale underscores the lasting fascination with Monroe's life and career, and the dress will undoubtedly continue to captivate and inspire generations to come."

    "prompt": "The fate of five Picasso murals on buildings damaged in the Anders Breivik bombing in Oslo in 2011 has led to a heated debate in Norway.",
    "HWT": "A panel of experts has recommended demolishing the buildings and removing the murals. But art experts say that as the murals were designed by Picasso for those specific buildings, they should remain where they are. The artworks were Picasso's first attempts at concrete murals. The murals were drawn specifically for the government buildings known as H and Y block. Picasso's designs were sandblasted onto the concrete both outside and inside the buildings by the Norwegian artist Carl Nesjar. Both buildings were damaged when Breivik set off a van bomb at the foot of H block in July 2011. It was the start of a series of attacks that left 77 dead, mostly teenagers on the island of Utoeya. The blast in Oslo killed eight people and badly damaged the H block, along with neighbouring ministries. A panel of experts has decided the most economical solution would be to demolish the buildings, cut the murals out and place them elsewhere. A recent poll by Norwegian newspaper Verdens Gang showed public opinion was divided, with 39.5% supporting demolition, while 34.3% thought the buildings should be kept. Artist Dag Hol was widely quoted as saying it was a \"golden opportunity\" to get rid of \"brutal, ugly and degrading architecture\". But Joern Holme, head of the Directorate for Cultural Heritage, said the buildings were historically important - architecturally, politically and artistically. \"We can't demolish the best (parts) of a cultural era just because we find it ugly today,\" he said. Norway's government has until early next year to decide what to do about the buildings. The rights to the murals are owned by the Picasso family and they must be consulted on what happens to them Claudia Andrieu, a legal expert with the Picasso Administration, said they have not been approached yet but are \"open to dialogue\".",
    "MGT": "Norway is embroiled in a fierce debate over the future of five murals designed by Spanish artist Pablo Picasso, which are currently located on buildings damaged during the 2011 bombing by far-right terrorist Anders Behring Breivik in Oslo. The murals, created in collaboration with Norwegian artist Carl Nesjar in the 1950s and 1960s, are considered culturally significant but are now at the center of a contentious preservation versus redevelopment dispute.\n\nThe buildings, part of the government quarter in Oslo, were severely damaged in Breivik's attack, which killed eight people and injured hundreds. In the aftermath, authorities have grappled with how to rebuild while balancing security concerns and the preservation of Norway’s cultural heritage. Officials have proposed demolishing the damaged buildings, including the Y-block, where two of the Picasso murals, \"The Fishermen\" and \"The Seagull,\" are integrated into the architecture. Plans to relocate the murals to a new structure have sparked passionate reactions.\n\nCritics argue that removing the murals from their original context would strip them of their historical and artistic significance. Many see the Y-block and its artwork as a symbol of Norway’s resilience and commitment to democracy in the face of terror. Preservationists and art historians have called for the buildings to be restored rather than torn down, emphasizing the importance of keeping the murals in their intended setting.\n\nOn the other side, proponents of demolition contend that the safety and modern needs of the government complex must take precedence. They highlight the structural damage caused by the bombing and the necessity of creating a more secure and efficient facility for government operations. The Norwegian government has defended its plans, stating that the murals will be carefully relocated and preserved, albeit in a different environment.\n\nAs the debate continues, protests, petitions, and public discussions have intensified. For many Norwegians, the controversy transcends art and architecture, touching on deeper issues of memory, identity, and how a nation chooses to heal and move forward after tragedy. The final decision may leave a lasting impact on both Oslo’s skyline and Norway’s cultural narrative."

In a trading statement, Aggreko said sales from its rental solutions division were down 1% on last year.

The uptick in mining stocks provided a much-needed boost to the overall market sentiment, which had been dampened by the previous week's downturn.\n\nInvestors found renewed confidence in the sector, encouraged by positive commodity prices and optimistic forecasts for global demand. Major mining companies saw their shares rise, helping to lift the index and offset some of the losses incurred at the end of last week. Analysts suggest that the mining sector's strength is reflective of broader economic trends and the critical role these companies play in the global supply chain.\n\nWhile the recovery was not enough to completely erase Friday's sharp decline, it did offer a glimmer of hope for market participants. The rebound underscores the volatile nature of financial markets and the delicate balance investors must navigate amidst fluctuating economic indicators."

    "prompt": "Nine military officers have been sacked over last month's attack by militants on the military hospital in Kabul, the Afghan defence ministry says.",
    "HWT": "Those dismissed include a general and a colonel. All face prosecution for negligence, the ministry said. The attack was one of the worst in the conflict-hit nation in recent months. About 50 people are said to have died as militants armed with guns, grenades and knives targeted patients and staff at the hospital. The brutal assault caused shock and anger among the public. Many people are still demanding to know why a building that was meant to be secure was so vulnerable to attack. The hospital is heavily guarded and the government says the attackers got inside after exploding a car bomb at the gate. But other reports suggest some attackers were already inside the hospital when the violence began, meaning militants had infiltrated the high-security site. There is also a lack of clarity over how many people died. Some hospital workers quoted in local media said the toll was much higher than the figure of about 50 reported by the government. The so-called Islamic State group said it carried out the attack, but some eyewitnesses later told media the assailants shouted slogans in support of the Taliban. The deputy interior minister was sacked in the immediate aftermath of the attack.",
    "MGT": "In a decisive move, the Afghan defense ministry has dismissed nine military officers following last month's devastating militant attack on a military hospital in Kabul. This action marks a significant response to one of the most shocking breaches of security in recent memory, which resulted in numerous casualties and a profound sense of vulnerability among Afghan citizens.\n\nThe attack, which targeted the Sardar Daud Khan hospital, the country's largest military medical facility, underscored the persistent threat posed by militant groups despite ongoing efforts to stabilize the region. Gunmen reportedly disguised themselves as medical staff, allowing them to penetrate the hospital's defenses and inflict maximum damage. The assault left over 30 people dead and more than 50 injured, including patients, medical personnel, and visitors.\n\nIn a statement, the defense ministry emphasized the need for accountability and reinforced its commitment to safeguarding national institutions. \"The dismissal of these officers reflects our determination to address shortcomings and ensure such incidents are not repeated,\" the statement read.\n\nThe removals are part of a broader strategy to overhaul security protocols and restore public confidence in the military's ability to protect critical infrastructure. This development comes amid ongoing international and domestic pressure on Afghan authorities to enhance security measures and prevent similar tragedies in the future. The Afghan government has vowed to continue investigating the attack and implement further reforms if necessary."

The woman managed to free herself from the vehicle on her third attempt but was groped during the abduction. Police praised the courage of the victim in speaking about the ordeal, which lasted for several minutes. More on the football coach jailed for sex attack, and other news Reilly, of Maunders Place, trained to be a football coach as part of a community programme run by Exeter City Football Club. The court heard character references from the club's Head of Community Jamie Vittles as well as Exmouth Town manager Richard Pears. Reilly had been driving his car around Exmouth town centre for 10 minutes which Judge Graham Cottle of Exeter Crown Court said made clear he'd \"obviously been following her\". The judge said: \"Eventually you tried to grab her. You grabbed her between the legs, pulling her into your car. I am not sure exactly how long she remained kidnapped but it was a few minutes before she was able to affect her release.\" Reilly had spent the afternoon looking at sex and prostitution websites before he went out in his car in the early hours of the morning.

    "MGT": "In a case that has sent shockwaves through the community, a local football coach has been sentenced to 18 months in prison after being found guilty of abducting and sexually assaulting a teenager. The case was heard at the County Court, where the details of the disturbing incident were laid bare, leading to the conviction and subsequent sentencing of the coach.\n\nThe court learned that the coach, who was in a position of trust and authority, exploited his role to target the victim, a promising young athlete. The incident occurred earlier this year, after a routine training session. Prosecutors described how the coach lured the teenager into his vehicle under the pretense of discussing the player’s future prospects. Instead, the coach drove the young athlete to a secluded area where the assault took place.\n\nThroughout the trial, the victim bravely recounted the traumatic experience, a testimony that played a crucial role in the conviction. The judge, in delivering the sentence, emphasized the breach of trust and the severe impact the crime had on the victim's life, noting how the actions of the coach had shattered the confidence and dreams of a young individual.\n\nThe sentencing serves as a stark reminder of the responsibilities that come with positions of authority, especially those involving minors. The community has expressed outrage and disbelief, with many calling for stricter regulations and safeguarding measures to prevent such incidents in the future.\n\nIn the aftermath of the trial, the football club has issued a statement expressing their deep regret over the incident and reassured parents and players of their commitment to ensuring a safe and supportive environment for all athletes. The club is also cooperating fully with authorities to review and enhance their safeguarding policies.\n\nThe case underscores the importance of vigilance and accountability in sports and other areas where adults are entrusted with the care and development of young individuals."

Since then he has become Exeter's record Premiership points-scorer, with 953, and equalled the top flight record of nine penalties in a match in 2014. \"I was lucky enough to get capped before I came over here,\" added Whitten, who agreed a new contract at Sandy Park last week. \"But similar to the English, although they don't openly say it, they don't like to pick guys playing outside of Ireland. \"That's fair enough, I accept that stance, and I enjoy playing here.

Whitten expressed frustration at the oversight, suggesting that national selectors may be underestimating the value Steenson could bring to the team. \"It's surprising he hasn't had a chance to show what he can do on the international stage,\" Whitten added. \"He’s got the experience, the skillset, and the temperament to thrive at that level.\"\n\nAs Exeter continues to shine in domestic competitions, the calls for Steenson’s inclusion in the Ireland setup may grow louder, with fans and teammates alike eager to see his talents recognized on a global stage."

    "HWT": "Interior Ministry spokesman Sediq Sediqqi tweeted that 64 \"innocent Afghans\" were killed and 347 wounded. A suicide attacker detonated a vehicle and a fierce gun battle followed in one of the deadliest attacks in Kabul for years. A Taliban spokesman said the group carried out the attack. It came a week after it said it was launching its \"spring offensive\", warning of large-scale attacks, although the group fights all year round. Why are the Taliban resurgent in Afghanistan? Tuesday's bombing happened during the morning rush hour in Pul-e-Mahmud, a busy neighbourhood where homes, mosques, schools and businesses nestle close to the ministry of defence, other ministries and military compounds. The blast shattered windows up to 1.6km (one mile) away. A police officer told the Associated Press it was one of the most powerful explosions he had ever heard, and he could not see or hear anything for 20 minutes after. It appears the initial blast cleared the way for Taliban fighters to enter the area - a commonly used tactic. It had previously been reported that at least 28 people had been killed and 329 injured. Mr Sediqqi told reporters that most of the 64 now reported dead were civilians. He said most of the wounded were in a stable condition. At least 71 Shia worshippers were killed in 2011 in a rare attack on a Shia shrine in Kabul. Afghan security forces regularly foil similar attacks, correspondents say, but with explosives easily available and bomb-making skills common, it is difficult to prevent all of them.",

Eyewitnesses reported scenes of utter chaos, with buildings reduced to rubble and streets littered with debris. Emergency response teams worked tirelessly to rescue survivors and recover bodies from the wreckage, while hospitals struggled to cope with the influx of wounded individuals. More than 300 people were reportedly injured in the attack, many of whom remain in critical condition.\n\nLocal authorities have blamed the attack on insurgent groups seeking to destabilize the country as it grapples with ongoing political and security challenges. While no group has yet claimed responsibility for the bombing, officials suspect it was meticulously planned to inflict maximum damage and casualties. The blast reportedly occurred during peak hours, targeting civilians as well as government personnel.\n\nThe international community has condemned the attack, with several countries expressing solidarity with Afghanistan in its fight against terrorism. Afghan President Ashraf Ghani described the bombing as a \"heinous act of terror\" and vowed to bring the perpetrators to justice.\n\nAs Kabul mourns those lost in the tragedy, the attack underscores the fragile security situation in Afghanistan and raises concerns about the effectiveness of measures to protect civilians from such atrocities. Grief-stricken families and survivors now face the daunting task of rebuilding their lives amidst the lingering fear of further violence."

    "HWT": "An Air India official told the BBC that the order had been made on the basis of a document issued by the civil aviation authority last year. The airline had warned 600 of its crew to \"shape up\" last year, but 125 had not managed to maintain the required weight, the official said. The airline says however that the issue is not one of weight, but \"fitness\". Airline officials confirmed to the BBC that the directive had been issued, but said it was part of an internal document which they could not comment on publicly. They said the basis for the recommendation was concern that \"unfit\" cabin crew would not be able to operate efficiently in emergency situations. Aviation regulations state that a Body Mass Index (BMI) of 18-25 is normal for a male cabin crew member, while for a female it is 18-22. Aviation expert Kapil Kaul told the BBC: \"An overweight crew is a signal the airline is not fit. You need a smart friendly agile crew that can complement the image of the airline.\" However, national union leader Tapan Sen denied that service rules mention any firm weight restriction for cabin crew. This is not the first time Air India has grounded staff over weight issues. In 2009, it dismissed nine hostesses for being \"overweight\" on safety grounds saying their shape could \"impair agility\". In 2004, the airline landed itself in further controversy when it said that potential air hostesses and stewards should not have any scars, acne, or any major marks on the face.",
    "MGT": "In a controversial move, India's national carrier, Air India, has announced its decision to ground 125 cabin crew members, citing concerns over their weight. This decision has sparked discussions about health standards in the aviation industry and the potential implications for those affected.\n\nAir India, which has long been a symbol of the country's aviation prowess, has stated that the decision is part of an effort to ensure safety and enhance the overall efficiency of its operations. According to the airline, having cabin crew who meet certain weight criteria is crucial for maintaining agility and quickness in the event of an emergency, as well as ensuring that all operational duties are performed effectively.\n\nThe airline's management has emphasized that this move should not be seen as discriminatory but rather as a necessary step to uphold safety standards. The decision aligns with guidelines from the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA), which mandates that cabin crew should maintain a Body Mass Index (BMI) within a specified range.\n\nHowever, the announcement has not been without its critics. Some labor unions and aviation experts have voiced concerns over the fairness and transparency of the evaluation process used to determine the crew's fitness levels. Critics argue that the focus on weight does not necessarily correlate with an individual's ability to perform their duties effectively. They advocate for a more comprehensive approach that considers overall fitness and health, rather than weight alone.\n\nAffected cabin crew members have expressed disappointment and uncertainty about their future employment prospects. Many are calling for a review of the airline's policies and highlighting the need for support and retraining programs to assist those impacted by the decision.\n\nAs Air India navigates this contentious issue, it remains to be seen how the airline will address the concerns raised while maintaining its commitment to safety and operational excellence."

    "prompt": "About 350 homes are to be built in the Govanhill area of Glasgow under a £6.4m council initiative to help \"turn the area around\".",
    "HWT": "The homes are planned to be for social or mid-market rent and it is hoped they will all be completed by 2021. Glasgow City Council's executive committee also approved £20m to improve existing housing. Of this, £14m was announced last month as part of scheme to upgrade homes and make them available for social renting. The £34m four-year improvement and repair scheme is also being funded with £20m from the Scottish government. The funding to build homes is to be channelled through housing associations over the next four years. Eight sites in the area have been identified for development. As part of the strategy, Govanhill Housing Association has also committed £3.7m to new housing and repairs for the duration of the four year period. Overall this means there are plans to invest more than £44m in housing in Govanhill over the next four years. Councillor George Redmond: \"This is an impressive document and points to the way ahead in Govanhill.\" \"Significant sums are being invested in Govanhill and it is great news that part of that money will go towards new housing. \"The council has been working exceptionally hard to turn things around in Govanhill and we are starting to see real progress being made.\" He said that while the council was keen to work with all property owners in Govanhill, he warned the council would use power of compulsory purchase against those who refused to get on board with the plans.",
    "MGT": "In a significant move aimed at rejuvenating the Govanhill area of Glasgow, a £6.4 million council initiative has been launched to construct approximately 350 new homes.

    "prompt": "A cocktail of amino acids - the building blocks of proteins - is the latest contender in the age-old search for the elixir of life.",
    "HWT": "Scientists gave mice drinking water laced with three amino acids. They said the rodents lived significantly longer than other mice fed a normal diet. The research, reported in a scientific journal, has yet to be tried in people. The study leader said a large patient trial was needed to provide evidence to convince doctors. In experiments, middle-aged healthy male mice were given drinking water containing the amino acids leucine, isoleucine and valine. Dr Enzo Nisoli, of the University of Milan, and colleagues, said it increased the average lifespan of the mice by 12% and boosted their fitness and co-ordination. They wrote in their paper, published in Cell Metabolism: \"Our study offers a rationale for deeply exploring the role of amino acids in prevention and control of age-related disorders in humans.\" The amino acids - three of the 20 that make up proteins - have been shown to extend life span in yeast. However, the precise role of these amino acids in humans is unknown. They are used by bodybuilders to maintain muscle tissue and can be bought in health food stores and online.",
    "MGT": "Scientists have uncovered a promising new candidate in the quest for longevity: a carefully formulated blend of amino acids, the fundamental components of proteins. These tiny molecules, essential for countless biological processes, appear to hold surprising potential in extending lifespan and improving overall health.\n\nRecent studies have revealed that specific combinations of amino acids, administered at optimal concentrations, may positively influence cellular function and combat the effects of aging. Researchers suggest that these compounds could enhance the body's ability to repair damaged tissues, regulate metabolism, and maintain key physiological systems. While amino acids are already recognized for their role in muscle development and immune support, this new application positions them as a potential cornerstone in anti-aging science.\n\nThough the concept of an \"elixir of life\" has long eluded humanity, advancements in molecular biology and biochemistry are steadily bringing the idea closer to reality. Scientists remain cautiously optimistic but emphasize that further research is needed before amino acid cocktails can be considered a viable therapeutic tool. Trials are underway to evaluate safety, effectiveness, and long-term benefits, with hopes of unlocking new ways to promote vitality and longevity. The discovery represents a promising step forward in understanding the complex interplay between nutrition and human aging."

    "prompt": "Barry Hawkins had a nightmare turnaround from his gripping victory over Ronnie O'Sullivan to trail Hong Kong's Marco Fu 7-1 in their World Championship quarter-final.",
    "HWT": "Hawkins won a draining final-frame thriller 13-12 over the pre-tournament favourite late on Monday night. But the Englishman was way below his best from the start against the world number 14 on Tuesday. He scored only 31 points as he lost the first five frames. Hawkins got on the board in frame six, but Fu easily won the last two frames to earn a six-frame advantage after the first session. The quarter-final tie is the best of 25 frames and the second session gets under way on Wednesday at 14:30 BST. Fu played with fluency and impressive cue ball control to take full advantage of some sloppy play by 2013 runner-up Hawkins - the only man to have made the semi-finals, when the Crucible switches to one table - in each of the last three years. But his chances of repeating that feat appear slim after being completely outplayed by London-based Fu, who recorded three half-centuries on his way to a 5-0 lead. World number 11 Hawkins took a scrappy sixth frame, but two half-centuries gave Fu frame seven and he rounded off the session with his sixth score of more than 50. The other afternoon match saw four-time champion John Higgins win four frames in a row to take a 5-3 lead in his all-Scottish meeting with Alan McManus. McManus, twice a World Championship quarter-finalist in the early 1990s, lost the opener but was then in imperious form as he secured a 3-1 mid-session interval lead with breaks of 114, 78 and 56. But the 45-year-old was out of sorts after the interval, appearing to be troubled by a neck problem. And Higgins, who has gone on to lift the title on the last three occasions he has reached the last eight at the Crucible, made the most of some decent chances to take control.

    "MGT": "Barry Hawkins faced a dramatic shift in fortunes at the World Snooker Championship, suffering a crushing 7-1 deficit against Hong Kong's Marco Fu in their quarter-final clash. The match marked a stark contrast to Hawkins' thrilling triumph over snooker legend Ronnie O'Sullivan in the previous round, a victory that had energized fans and bolstered his confidence heading into the tournament’s latter stages.\n\nHawkins had entered the quarter-finals riding high after his gripping encounter with O'Sullivan, a match that showcased his resilience and skill under pressure. However, the momentum he had built seemed to evaporate against Fu, who dominated the table with precision and composure. Fu displayed exceptional control and tactical brilliance, capitalizing on Hawkins’ errors and consistently keeping him at bay.\n\nFrom the outset, Fu asserted himself, winning the opening frames with a series of impressive breaks that left Hawkins struggling to find his rhythm. The Englishman appeared uncharacteristically subdued, missing crucial opportunities and allowing Fu to extend his lead frame by frame. By the mid-session interval, Fu had carved out a commanding position, leaving Hawkins with an uphill battle to stay in contention.\n\nThe one-sided nature of the match shocked spectators, many of whom had expected Hawkins to maintain the form that carried him past O'Sullivan. Fu, however, was relentless in his pursuit of victory, demonstrating the skill and mental fortitude that have made him a formidable presence on the world stage. His performance in the session drew praise from analysts and fans alike, as he emerged as a strong contender for a place in the semi-finals.\n\nFor Hawkins, the turnaround was a bitter pill to swallow. After the highs of defeating O'Sullivan, the quarter-final against Fu served as a sobering reminder of the unpredictable nature of the sport. With the second session looming, Hawkins will need to dig deep to mount a comeback and keep his World Championship hopes alive. Meanwhile, Fu appears poised to capitalize on his advantage and secure his place in the next round."

    "HWT": "Police were trying to clear the blockade, which has cut supply lines of fuel and other goods, when protesters attacked a police post at Birgunj. Reports say the man was shot in the head and later died in hospital. The demonstrators, mainly from southern lowland minority groups, are angry about Nepal's new constitution. Communities from the lowlands believe that Nepal's proposed new provinces will lead to their political marginalisation. These concerns have led to violent clashes around Nepal since August, leaving dozens dead. The protester killed on Monday was identified as Ashish Kumar Ram, from Raxaul in the Indian state of Bihar, local officials said. Local police chief Rajubabu Shrestha told the BBC the protesters had entered Nepali territory from India, throwing stones. He said seven protesters and nine police had been injured. Nepal's Home Ministry Spokesman Laxmi Dhakal said two Indian nationals were arrested after they tried to obstruct police who were removing tents at the border. India said it was \"deeply concerned\" by events. \"Issues facing Nepal are political in nature and cannot be resolved by force. \"Causes underlying the present state of confrontation need to addressed by the government of Nepal credibly and effectively,\" the Indian foreign ministry said in a statement. Earlier, there were conflicting reports about the police crackdown. One report said police baton-charged demonstrators forcing them to remove the blockade, while another said authorities removed the tents of sleeping protesters and lined up trucks to pass through the crossing. Police official Hobindra Bogati told the Associated Press news agency that more than 200 trucks and other vehicles had crossed from Birgunj in Nepal to Raxaul and more were lining up. But, on the Indian side, thousands of trucks have not been able to cross over to Nepal for almost two months.  Reports said the trucks bringing fuel and other goods to Nepal were still blocked by Indian custom officials.",
    "MGT": "Tensions escalated at the India-Nepal border on Thursday as protests turned violent, resulting in the death of an Indian national. The incident occurred at the Raxaul-Birgunj border crossing, a critical trade route between the two countries, where hundreds of demonstrators had gathered to block the passage in protest against Nepal's new constitution.\n\nThe protest, which has been ongoing for weeks, is part of a larger movement led by the Madhesi community and other ethnic groups in Nepal. They argue that the new constitution marginalizes their political representation and fails to address their demands for equal rights and federal autonomy. The blockade, which has severely disrupted the flow of goods, particularly fuel and essential supplies, has further strained Nepal-India relations.\n\nAccording to local reports, Nepali police opened fire on the protesters in an attempt to disperse the crowd after the situation grew increasingly volatile. The Indian national, whose identity has not yet been confirmed, was reportedly caught in the crossfire and succumbed to his injuries shortly after the incident. Several others were injured during the clash.\n\nThe death of the Indian citizen has sparked outrage on both sides of the border, with calls for accountability and an immediate de-escalation of the crisis. Indian officials have condemned the use of force by Nepali authorities, urging them to exercise restraint and engage in dialogue to resolve the underlying issues. Meanwhile, Nepali officials have defended their actions, stating that the protests were disrupting public order and threatening national security.\n\nThe prolonged blockade has placed immense pressure on Nepal, which is still recovering from the devastating earthquake that struck earlier this year. The disruption of trade has led to acute shortages of fuel, medicine, and other essential goods, exacerbating the hardships faced by the Nepali people.\n\nAs the situation remains tense, international observers are calling for urgent negotiations between the Nepali government and the protesting groups. The resolution of the crisis is seen as critical not only for restoring stability in Nepal but also for maintaining the historically close ties between the two neighboring nations."

A further 28 Iraqi troops were wounded, while militant casualties are unknown. The incidents took place near the Ain al-Asad airbase, where US forces are currently training Iraq's military. The attacks were carried out on Tuesday near the town of al-Baghdadi, which is 110 miles (180 km) north-west of Baghdad. No group has said it was behind the the attacks. However, they come as Iraqi forces battle fighters from the Islamic State (IS) militant group, which has seized large swathes of Iraq and neighbouring Syria. Iraqi forces are providing training to local fighters at the Ain al-Asad base, and on Monday Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi called for a \"tribal revolution\" against IS. Meanwhile, IS said it had killed eight men in Iraq's Salahuddin province for allegedly co-operating with government security forces and international airstrikes, AP news agency reported. A series of photos posted on a Twitter account used by the group showed the men kneeling and blindfolded beside a riverbank.

The violence underscores the ongoing instability and the formidable challenge that Iraqi forces continue to face in the region.\n\nThe skirmishes erupted early Saturday morning as militants launched a series of coordinated attacks against military positions held by Iraqi security forces and their allied fighters. The militants, believed to be remnants of the Islamic State, targeted the strategic town of Hit, which has been a focal point of conflict due to its location near key supply routes.\n\nWitnesses described a scene of chaos and destruction, with heavy gunfire and explosions echoing throughout the town. Despite reinforcements being dispatched to the area, the militants were reportedly well-prepared, employing guerrilla tactics that have become their signature in recent years.\n\nIn addition to the fatalities, numerous fighters from both sides were injured, adding to the strain on local medical facilities. The Iraqi military has vowed to retaliate, launching airstrikes and ground operations to regain control of the contested areas and to prevent further incursions.\n\nThe situation in Anbar remains volatile, with fears of further escalation as both sides continue to mobilize forces. The ongoing conflict highlights the persistent threat posed by militant groups, even as Iraq attempts to rebuild and stabilize following years of devastating warfare.\n\nAs the nation mourns the loss of its soldiers and fighters, there is a renewed call for unity and resilience in the face of adversity, with officials urging the international community for continued support in combating extremism and fostering peace in the region."

Some customers, especially those who have been with the company for years, are unhappy that calls are not treated equally. But EE said that they had set high standards for their customer service operations. One customer - Andrew Griffiths - told BBC Radio 4's You and Yours that he would consider switching if EE was the only firm to do this. It added that the \"small charges\" for certain services contributed to the investment in this side of the business. The priority answering system is similar in some ways to queue jumping charges at airports and theme parks.

He said Gatwick Airport should be expanded, with \"high speed links\" between the two and a single check-in. But rival David Lammy accused him of \"the same Ed Miliband politics\". \"My view is the way to proceed is no third runway at Heathrow,\" Mr Khan said, calling for \"a better Heathrow, not a bigger one\". But Tottenham MP Mr Lammy questioned the timing of Mr Khan's decision, which came after the emergence of Conservative MP and environmental campaigner Zac Goldsmith as a potential Tory candidate for the 2016 election. \"Zac Goldsmith has announced he's running and suddenly Sadiq is against it,\" he said, accusing Mr Khan of \"playing the same Ed Miliband politics that got us nowhere\". Former culture secretary Tessa Jowell said she was prepared to wait until the final report of the Airports Commission which is looking at the options for expanding London's air capacity before making up her mind. But she warned against the issue becoming \"gridlocked\" in government. \"We can't go on forever putting this decision off because it's just too difficult,\" she said. Journalist Christian Wolmar said climate change should inform the decision, while Harrow West MP Gareth Thomas said new runways should be built at both Heathrow and Gatwick. Hackney North and Stoke Newington MP Diane Abbott also opposed Heathrow expansion. The candidates were also asked about the \"mansion\" tax on homes worth over Â£2m that was proposed by Labour ahead of the general election. Mr Lammy, Ms Jowell, Ms Abbott and Mr Wolmar all criticised the policy, with Ms Jowell saying that while it had been \"well intentioned\" it had been \"emblematically disastrous\" for Labour because it had caused people \"anxiety\" even if they weren't affected.",

The event, which marked the beginning of the selection process for Labour’s nomination for London mayor, saw candidates outline their visions for the city while addressing pressing issues such as housing, transport, and climate change.\n\nThe debate quickly turned heated as the topic of airport expansion came to the fore. With London’s air travel hubs operating under increasing pressure, the question of whether expanding airport capacity aligns with Labour’s environmental and economic priorities divided the candidates. Some argued that expansion would boost the local economy and create jobs, while others warned of the environmental consequences and the potential for increased air pollution in already congested areas.\n\nOne candidate, emphasizing the importance of sustainable development, stated that airport expansion could undermine efforts to meet London’s climate targets. They argued that the city should focus on improving green infrastructure and public transport networks instead. Another contender countered by highlighting the economic benefits of expansion, suggesting that London’s position as a global hub for business and tourism could be strengthened by increased airport capacity. They further maintained that technological advancements could mitigate environmental concerns.\n\nThe debate also touched on broader issues, including housing affordability and public safety. While the candidates presented differing strategies to tackle these challenges, airport expansion was clearly the most contentious topic of the evening, drawing sharp lines between competing visions for the city’s future.\n\nThe hustings, attended by Labour Party members and local residents, set the tone for what is expected to be a closely watched and highly competitive race. With Labour seeking to retain control of London’s mayoralty, the eventual nominee will face the task of uniting the party while addressing the diverse needs of the capital’s population.\n\nAs the selection process continues, the issue of airport expansion is likely to remain a flashpoint, reflecting broader debates about balancing economic growth with environmental sustainability. The candidates now have the task of refining their positions and winning over members ahead of the final vote, which will determine who will represent Labour in the race for City Hall."

    "prompt": "A Welsh rugby player has been banned after testing positive for a steroid.",
    "HWT": "Joseph Phelps of Newbridge RFC cannot play for four years, making him the 13th Welsh rugby union player to currently be serving a ban. United Kingdom Anti-Doping says Phelps' use of nandrolone was detected in June 2015 and he is banned until July 2019. A summary of the tribunal published by Ukad said Phelps claimed he had taken Viagra and a \"test booster\" product to treat erectile dysfunction. He also claimed not to have taken anything \"for performance enhancement in sport\" but to treat symptoms he had suffered after sustaining a testicular injury. A report by Professor David Cowan, Director of the Drug Control Centre at King's College London, confirmed to the tribunal that \"the human body does not naturally produce nandrolone in measurable quantities and that nandrolone is a drug administered via deep intra-muscular injection\". Ukad legal chief Graham Arthur said athletes are \"solely responsible\" for banned substance found in their system. Arthur added: \"This case highlights that all athletes, regardless of level, must be aware, and understand, the risks to their sporting careers if they test positive. \"They must ensure they manage that risk at all times.\" Phelps' ban comes less than a month after Ukad chief executive Nicole Sapstead said a \"societal problem\" could be the cause of steroid drug use in Welsh rugby. Newbridge play in Swalec Championship.",
    "MGT": "A Welsh rugby player has been handed a ban after testing positive for a steroid, sparking discussions about doping in the sport. The player, whose identity has not been disclosed, was subjected to routine testing as part of anti-doping protocols and returned a positive result for a banned substance. The substance in question is classified as a steroid, which is prohibited under the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) guidelines.\n\nFollowing the test results, an independent disciplinary panel reviewed the case and imposed a suspension on the player. The length of the ban has not been revealed, but it is expected to significantly impact the athlete's career and reputation. Rugby authorities in Wales have reaffirmed their commitment to clean sport, emphasizing the importance of upholding integrity and fair competition within the game.\n\nThe incident has reignited debates about the prevalence of performance-enhancing drugs in professional sports. Critics argue that stricter measures and more rigorous testing protocols are needed to deter athletes from resorting to banned substances. Meanwhile, supporters of the current system maintain that the existing framework is effective in identifying and penalizing offenders.\n\nThe governing body overseeing the sport in Wales expressed disappointment over the situation, reiterating its zero-tolerance stance toward doping violations. The organization stated that education and awareness programs are critical in ensuring players understand the consequences of using prohibited substances.\n\nAs the banned player begins serving their suspension, the incident serves as a reminder of the ongoing challenges sports face in combating doping and preserving the integrity of competition."

    "HWT": "Unison said the council had failed to provide answers for social care expert Tony Garthwaite, heading the investigation, and that he was not able to complete his report. Awel Deg care home was shut in February 2014, making 40 employees redundant. The council said it was working with Mr Garthwaite. Awel Deg was closed following the suspension of 11 members of staff and concerns about standards of care. The council said in May 2014 the facility would re-open as a dementia home in spring 2015, but a spokesman said on Wednesday that this could not happen until Mr Garthwaite's investigation was complete. Jeff Baker, regional organiser for Unison, said the union had written to the council complaining about the wait. \"It is very disappointing,\" he said. \"Unison understands that Mr Garthwaite cannot complete his report because the council has not taken steps to provide answers to key matters that Mr Garthwaite has put forward.\" A council spokesman said it was aware of Unison's comments. \"The council is working with Tony Garthwaite... to ensure that he has access to all the relevant information that he requires in order that he can complete his investigation,\" the spokesman said.",
    "MGT": "Tensions have escalated in Ceredigion as a union has accused the local council of failing to cooperate with an investigation into the closure of a residential home in Llandysul. The home, which had been a vital part of the community, providing care for the elderly and vulnerable, was shuttered abruptly, leaving many residents and their families in distress.\n\nThe union, representing staff and affected families, has expressed frustration over what they describe as a lack of transparency and cooperation from the council. They claim that the council has been unresponsive to requests for information, making it difficult to understand the rationale behind the closure and the measures that were taken to ensure the welfare of the displaced residents.\n\nAccording to union representatives, the closure has had a significant impact not only on the residents but also on the staff who faced sudden job losses. Many have criticized the council for not providing adequate support or alternative solutions for those affected.\n\nLocal residents have joined the call for more transparency, demanding answers and accountability from the council. They argue that the closure of such an essential facility should have been handled with greater care and consideration.\n\nThe council has yet to respond to these allegations, leaving many in the community anxious and awaiting clarification. As the investigation continues, the union and the affected families remain hopeful for a resolution that prioritizes the well-being of the former residents and staff."

    "HWT": "County host the Dons in one of three all-Premiership Scottish Cup fifth-round fixtures. \"Our best performances this season have been against the bigger sides,\" McIntyre told BBC Scotland. \"We know we're going to have to have a good performance again in order to get into the next round.\" McIntyre's men beat Aberdeen when they visited Victoria Park in the league in December and also defeated them in Dingwall last season. \"Aberdeen are playing well at the moment,\" said McIntyre of the side sitting second in the Premiership. \"They've got real pace in their team. They're a real threat at set-plays also. \"We know we need to bring the type of performance that we've had against them here in Dingwall over the last year or so. It's going to take something similar again. \"Their front four are very potent and they've got lots of goals in them and generally most of their goals come from that. \"You need to try and nullify that major threat that they have in that front four positions.\" County drew 1-1 with Rangers at Ibrox in last weekend's Premiership match, having led 1-0 at the break. And McIntyre's assistant Billy Dodds told Radio Scotland's Sportsound: \"The Rangers game on Saturday, it's the best first 45 minutes we've played at any big ground, whether it's Aberdeen, Celtic, Rangers. \"We really deserved to probably be a couple in front but it wasn't to be. \"We've been a bit inconsistent in the league this year. We look a right good team sometimes. \"It's not the ideal draw [against Aberdeen] but it's a great game to take part in. It's such a tricky tie, it'd be hard to call. \"I would like to get through the tie at first time of asking.

    "prompt": "The safety of a light aircraft was compromised in a near-miss with a commercial drone, investigators found.",
    "HWT": "The incident happened near Byfield 2,000ft (610m) over the skies of Northamptonshire, in May. The pilot of the Van's RV-6 two-seater, single engine craft had to take evasive action, and the drone passed down the left-hand side of the aircraft. He reported the near-miss, but the drone could not be seen on radar and the operator could not be traced. The UK Airprox Board, set up to enhance air safety in the UK, branded the risk rating a \"category B\", meaning the aircraft's security was compromised. The pilot described the drone as a \"red and yellow, three-rotor drone\", which was the \"type that can be easily bought in shops and not a commercial surveillance type vehicle\". The report states the drone operator should not have been operating the drone at such a high altitude. It says: \"Because the drone was being operated at an altitude it should not have been, the reported drone was flown into conflict with the RV6. \"Although there was no radar data to measure the exact separation, the Board thought it was clear from the pilot's report that this was a fairly close encounter, and they assessed the risk as Category B.\"",
    "MGT": "A light aircraft narrowly avoided disaster after a close encounter with a commercial drone, investigators have revealed. The incident occurred during a routine flight when the pilot of the aircraft spotted the drone dangerously close to his flight path. According to the report, the drone was operating in airspace designated for manned aircraft, putting the safety of the pilot and passengers at significant risk.\n\nInvestigators noted that the drone's operator failed to adhere to established aviation safety regulations, including restrictions on operating near airports and flying above designated altitude limits. The pilot of the light aircraft managed to take evasive action, preventing a collision that could have led to catastrophic consequences.\n\nThis near-miss highlights growing concerns over the integration of drones into shared airspace. Experts warn that as drone usage continues to expand, stricter enforcement of regulations and improved education for operators are essential to prevent future incidents. While drones offer significant benefits in industries such as photography, delivery, and surveying, their potential to interfere with manned flights poses serious challenges.\n\nAuthorities are calling for enhanced safety measures, including mandatory identification systems for drones and increased penalties for violations. The investigation serves as a stark reminder of the need for responsible drone operation, as the consequences of negligence could be devastating for both manned and unmanned aviation."

Tim Lezard, from Stroud Labour Party, which organised the campaign, said it was \"a local service that people need\". But Paul Jennings, from Gloucestershire Care Services NHS Trust, said keeping it open was \"not practical\". Mr Jennings said: \"We're not in a position to provide an overnight service at Stroud and Cirencester minor injury units, that's why we've had to have so many closures over the last few months. \"We simply cannot recruit the staff to work those shifts. They don't want to do it, there are very few patients. It's potentially quite de-skilling and demoralising for the nurses who would be working there.  It's just not a practical proposition.\" Mr Lezard said: \"The danger is now that people will have to go to Gloucester and it is already overstretched in A & E there.\" There are eight minor injury units in Gloucestershire. Cirencester and Stroud hospitals currently offer a 24 hour service. Other units, which are not open overnight, are based in Dilke Memorial Hospital, Lydney and District Hospital, North Cotswolds Hospital, Tewkesbury Hospital, Vale Community Hospital and Tetbury Hospital. The units treat both adults and children for a variety of injuries and illnesses including sprains, minor fractures, cuts and wounds and rashes, bites or stings.",
    "MGT": "A growing concern among residents of Gloucestershire has prompted a petition urging local authorities to maintain the 24-hour operation of the minor injuries unit at a local hospital. This petition is set to be presented to Gloucestershire county councillors, reflecting the community's apprehension over potential changes in the service hours that could affect emergency care accessibility.\n\nThe minor injuries unit, a crucial component of the hospital’s emergency services, provides immediate care for non-life-threatening conditions, including sprains, minor fractures, and other urgent health issues. It has been operating round the clock, ensuring that residents have access to necessary medical attention at all hours. The prospect of reducing its operational hours has sparked concern among community members who argue that limited access could lead to longer waiting times and increased pressure on emergency departments.\n\nLocal residents have rallied together to draft the petition, gathering signatures to showcase the widespread support for keeping the unit open at all times. \"This unit is a lifeline for many, especially during late hours when other medical facilities are closed,\" said one resident. \"Reducing its hours could endanger lives and strain our already overburdened healthcare system.\"\n\nCounty councillors are expected to review the petition at their upcoming meeting, where they will consider the community's plea alongside budgetary and logistical factors. The outcome of this decision could set a precedent for how similar healthcare services are managed across the region.\n\nCommunity leaders emphasize the importance of public input in such decisions, urging residents to continue voicing their concerns. As the petition gains momentum, the hope is that the councillors will recognize the critical role the unit plays in ensuring the health and safety of Gloucestershire's residents."

    "HWT": "Six Baltimore police officers face criminal charges for the death of Gray, who died of a critical spine injury while in police custody in April. Riots, looting and violence shook the city in the days following the black 25-year-old's death. The city will propose the settlement to its Board of Estimates on Wednesday. Gray was in the back of a prisoner transport van when he was injured. His death is of one of several involving black Americans and police which has spurred national debate, unrest and various social justice movements. Baltimore police have admitted he was not secured by a seatbelt, as required by law, and he was denied medical attention while in the van. The settlement would \"resolve all civil claims related to the City of Baltimore, the Baltimore Police Department, individual Baltimore Police offers and any other persons or institutions who might be deemed responsible for the death of Mr Gray,\" according to a statement from Baltimore Mayor Stephanie-Rawlings Blake. The payment does not resolve any \"factual disputes\" surrounding his death and does not admit liability or fault on the part of the city or the police department, the statement added. It is not a judgement on the guilt or innocence of the officers facing trial, said Ms Rawlings-Blake. The total payment being proposed for Gray's case is more than the total paid out by the city for more than 120 other lawsuits against the Baltimore Police Department since 2011, the Baltimore Sun newspaper reports. The officers facing criminal charges ranging from false imprisonment to involuntary manslaughter have pleaded not guilty. Dates for their trials have not been set yet.",

The agreement, if approved by the city's Board of Estimates, represents one of the largest settlements in the city’s history related to allegations of police misconduct.\n\nFreddie Gray, a 25-year-old Black man, suffered fatal spinal injuries in April 2015 after being arrested and transported in a police van. His death ignited demonstrations across Baltimore and drew national attention to issues of police brutality and systemic racism. Protesters demanded justice for Gray and accountability for the officers involved in his arrest and transport.\n\nSix police officers faced charges related to Gray’s death, ranging from misconduct to second-degree murder. However, none of them were convicted. The case became a focal point in the ongoing debate about policing practices and the treatment of Black communities in America.\n\nThe proposed settlement does not signify an admission of guilt or liability by the city or the officers involved. Instead, it seeks to resolve the civil claims brought by Gray’s family. Baltimore officials emphasized that the settlement would prevent further litigation costs and provide closure to the family, as well as the community.\n\nCity officials stated that the payout would be distributed over two years and financed through Baltimore’s self-insurance program. The settlement comes as the city continues to grapple with calls for police reform and efforts to restore public trust.\n\nFreddie Gray’s death remains a painful chapter in Baltimore’s history, but city leaders hope the settlement will contribute to healing and spark broader discussions about justice and equity. Gray’s family has expressed their commitment to honoring his memory and supporting efforts to reform policing practices in the city and beyond."

However, the decision to suspend the writer suggests the show’s producers are distancing themselves from personal attacks on family members, particularly children. Critics and supporters alike have weighed in, with some defending the writer’s right to free speech, while others argue that the remark crossed a line of decency.\n\nThe incident highlights ongoing tensions surrounding political commentary in entertainment, as well as the fine line between satire and personal criticism.

    "HWT": "Locals fear it will damage the environment and pollute their water sources. La Colosa, in Central Colombia, has the potential to become South America's largest gold mine. Mr Arce said the town's decision could not be applied retroactively. The minister added that the South African mining giant AngloGold Ashanti had already been issued an exploration licence, which would retain its validity. Mr Arce also said that while the land was under the control of local authorities, any subterranean riches were under the control of the national government. The minister said that if AngloGold Ashanti was awarded the environmental licence it needs to proceed with the project, the courts or Colombia's congress would have to decide whether the local or national authorities prevailed. Mr Arce insisted that the referendum vote would not affect foreign investment in Colombia's mining sector. \"For the first time in 20 years we will have three major projects in execution phase,\" he told RCN. He said campaigners had misinformed voters. \"We're not talking about an open-air mine here,\" he said. \"Nor are there a hundred rivers at risk.\" Campaigners were angered by Mr Arce's comments. The opposition to President Juan Manuel Santos also criticised the government's stance on the issue. \"Santos and the Mining Minister agreed to disregard Cajamarca's decision on La Colosa. Democratic mobilisation will also defeat them,\" tweeted opposition Senator and presidential hopeful Jorge Robledo. Only 76 residents of Cajamarca, in the central province of Tolima, voted in favour of the mining project in Sunday's referendum, while more than 6,100 of the town's 19,000 inhabitants voted against. Several other Colombian cities and towns are planning to hold similar votes to try to block mining projects in their area. Correction 29 March 2017: This story has been amended to clarify the government's position on the mining ban.",
    "MGT": "Colombia's Mining Minister, German Arce, has raised doubts about whether the outcome of a local referendum in Cajamarca, which overwhelmingly rejected a major gold mining project, will ultimately stand. The referendum, held on Sunday, saw 98% of voters in the small town oppose the development of the proposed La Colosa mine, a project spearheaded by AngloGold Ashanti, one of the world’s largest mining companies. With participation from over 6,000 residents, the vote reflected widespread concern about the environmental and social impacts of the venture.\n\nLa Colosa, located in the Tolima department, has been touted as one of the most significant gold deposits in South America, with potential reserves estimated to be worth billions of dollars. However, local opposition has grown in recent years, fueled by fears that the mine could lead to deforestation, water contamination, and long-term harm to the region's agricultural economy. Cajamarca is known as the \"agricultural heart of Colombia,\" and residents argue that mining activity would jeopardize its fertile lands and sustainable development.\n\nDespite the resounding rejection, Minister Arce has suggested that the legal validity of the referendum may be subject to further scrutiny. Speaking to local media, he emphasized the need to weigh the results of the vote against national interests and existing legal frameworks. \"The question now is whether this decision can be upheld, given the scope of mining laws and the country's economic priorities,\" Arce stated. His remarks have sparked concerns among environmental activists and community leaders, who view the referendum as a crucial expression of local sovereignty.\n\nAngloGold Ashanti, which has invested heavily in exploration activities in the region, has yet to issue a formal response to the referendum. The company has previously argued that its operations adhere to strict environmental standards and contribute to local economic growth.\n\nThe outcome of the Cajamarca vote highlights the growing debate in Colombia over balancing resource extraction with environmental preservation and community rights. As legal challenges loom, the future of the La Colosa project remains uncertain, with both sides bracing for a protracted battle over the region's destiny."

    "HWT": "Trailing 24-15 at the break, Newcastle scored four tries in 18 second-half minutes to turn the game around. Scrum-half Takulua crossed the line three times and also added another nine points with his boot off the tee. Northampton, who earned a bonus point of their own with four tries, were undone by a series of defensive and handling errors in the second half. A second successive home win for Newcastle lifts them above Northampton to seventh and just a point behind sixth-placed Harlequins. Northampton have now lost their past two Premiership matches to fall to eighth and are without an away win in six games in all competitions. Jim Mallinder's side made a terrific start with two tries inside the opening five minutes from Ken Pisi and Jamie Gibson. Harry Mallinder's score in the corner seemingly put them in charge at the break despite Takulua and Sean Robinson crossing for the hosts. But a lightning restart from Newcastle saw Rob Vickers and a Takulua brace change the complexion of the game within 10 minutes. Falcons went on to inflict further damage through hooker Kyle Cooper before Mikey Haywood kept Saints in the hunt, although Mark Wilson's late score from a rolling maul settled the affair. Newcastle: Tait; Goneva, Waldouck, Socino, Sinoti; Hodgson, Takulua; Vickers, Cooper, Welsh, Green, Robinson, Wilson, Welch (capt), Latu. Replacements: Lawson, Harris, Wilson, Fonua, Olmstead, Egerton, Delany, Watson. Northampton: Tuala; K. Pisi, Tuitavake, Mallinder, Foden (capt); Myler, Groom; A.

    "MGT": "Newcastle Falcons delivered a commanding performance at Kingston Park, securing a decisive victory over Northampton Saints, thanks to a spectacular hat-trick by Sonatane Takulua. The match, which drew an enthusiastic crowd, showcased Newcastle's prowess and determination as they outplayed their opponents in a thrilling encounter.\n\nFrom the outset, Newcastle demonstrated their intent, with Takulua, the Tongan scrum-half, leading the charge. His agility and strategic play were instrumental in setting the tone for the match. The Falcons quickly took control of the game, with Takulua's first try coming early in the first half. His ability to find gaps in Northampton's defense was evident as he made a brilliant run, diving over the line to score.\n\nThe Falcons maintained their momentum with solid team coordination and effective ball handling. Their forward pack dominated the scrums, providing a strong platform for the backs to exploit. Newcastle's defense was equally impressive, thwarting several of Northampton's advances and preventing them from gaining any significant foothold in the game.\n\nTakulua's second try was a testament to his speed and awareness on the field. Spotting an opportunity, he intercepted a pass from Northampton's backline and sprinted towards the try line, evading tackles with ease. The crowd erupted in cheers as he crossed over for his second score, further extending Newcastle's lead.\n\nAs the match progressed, Newcastle continued to apply pressure, with their relentless attack proving too much for Northampton to handle. Takulua completed his hat-trick in the final quarter of the game, once again showcasing his exceptional skill and game awareness. A well-timed pass from the fly-half allowed him to slice through Northampton's defense, securing his third try of the evening.\n\nThe final whistle confirmed Newcastle's emphatic victory, with Takulua rightfully earning man-of-the-match honors for his outstanding performance. This win not only boosts Newcastle's standing in the league but also reinforces their reputation as a formidable force on the rugby field. Fans left Kingston Park in high spirits, eagerly anticipating the Falcons' next challenge."

    "prompt": "Anyone lucky enough to have a £50 note in their wallet or purse will find it is the only banknote made of paper in a few years.",
    "HWT": "The Bank of England has announced that the next design of the £20 note will be plastic. The new £20 note, entering circulation in 2020, will follow the polymer £5 and £10 notes. Consumers will be able to get their hands on the new plastic £5 note, the first in the polymer series, from 2016. This will feature the image of Sir Winston Churchill. The Bank argues that the polymer notes stay cleaner and are more secure than cotton paper notes, which have been used for more than 100 years. The £5 polymer note will enter circulation in the autumn of 2016, followed by the Jane Austen plastic £10 note a year later. The Bank said that the decision for the £20 note to also be made from polymer came after \"extensive research into the developments in security features\". On a more practical level for many consumers, it will also survive a spin in the washing machine. A bank committee is considering which character will appear on the new £20 note. It received 29,701 nominations from the public after it announced it wanted to celebrate an artist on the note. Some 592 eligible visual artists are being considered for the honour. The final decision will be made by the Bank's governor, Mark Carney. Favourites include the sculptor and artist Barbara Hepworth, the author Beatrix Potter and fashion designer Alexander McQueen. Whoever wins will replace the economist Adam Smith on the current £20 note. The next £50 could also be made of plastic, but it will be some time before that decision is made. The latest version of the note, featuring Matthew Boulton and James Watt, only entered circulation in November 2011. Clydesdale Bank in Scotland has issued a limited number of polymer notes. In 1999, Northern Bank of Northern Ireland issued a polymer £5 commemorative note celebrating the year 2000. A plastic note was introduced in the Isle of Man in 1983 but was withdrawn in 1988 owing to problems with the ink.",
    "MGT": "The £50 note, a familiar symbol of wealth and prestige, is set to undergo a significant transformation. In the coming years, the iconic paper banknote will become a rarity, as it is phased out in favor of polymer notes. This shift marks the end of paper currency in the UK, with the £50 note standing as the last remaining paper banknote in circulation.\n\nPolymer notes, introduced by the Bank of England in recent years, have gradually replaced their paper counterparts. Made from a type of plastic, these notes are more durable, resistant to wear and tear, and incorporate advanced security features that make counterfeiting far more difficult. The transition began with the launch of the polymer £5 note in 2016, followed by the £10 and £20 notes in subsequent years.\n\nThe decision to move away from paper currency stems from the need to modernize the nation's money supply. Polymer notes are not only more environmentally friendly, lasting far longer than paper money, but they are also cleaner, as they are less prone to absorbing dirt and moisture. These qualities make polymer notes a practical choice for everyday transactions, especially in a world where cash usage continues to decline in favor of digital payments.\n\nFor those who still carry cash, the £50 note holds a unique place in the public's imagination. Often associated with luxury purchases or special occasions, it has long been a symbol of affluence. However, its days as a paper banknote are numbered. The Bank of England has confirmed that a polymer £50 note will enter circulation in the near future, replacing its paper predecessor completely.\n\nOnce the transition is complete, anyone fortunate enough to possess a paper £50 note will hold a piece of history, as it will be the last trace of paper money in the UK. The move signifies the end of an era and the beginning of a new chapter in the evolution of currency. As the nation embraces polymer banknotes, the £50 note’s transformation serves as a reminder of how money continues to adapt to the changing demands of society."

He was detained under a European arrest warrant at Heathrow Airport last month. Dutch authorities reportedly abandoned a bid to bring him to the Netherlands. Mr de Mooi, whose real name is Joseph Connagh, was said to be \"very pleased\". His manager said in a statement: \"CJ is obviously very pleased with the result of today's hearing and will continue to co-operate with the Dutch authorities until this matter is finally concluded. \"He would like to thank the tens of thousands of people who have contacted him via social media and in person, for their lovely words and support during this traumatic time for him.\" Mr de Mooi's autobiography, published last year, described an incident in which he said he may have killed a man while he lived on the streets. He said he punched a man who approached him with a knife before throwing him into a canal in 1988. In his book, he wrote: \"He caught me on the wrong day and I just snapped. I fully suspect I killed him. I've no idea what happened to him.\" Mr de Mooi, originally from Barnsley, South Yorkshire, adopted the name de Mooi when modelling. He became a panellist on Eggheads in 2003 after winning a series of game shows.",
    "MGT": "Former Eggheads star CJ de Mooi has stated his commitment to cooperating with Dutch authorities following an unsuccessful extradition attempt concerning an alleged killing. The television personality, known for his time on the popular quiz show Eggheads, was recently at the center of a legal battle as the Netherlands sought his extradition.\n\nThe case revolves around an alleged incident from 1988 when de Mooi, whose real name is Joseph Connagh, reportedly encountered a man who later died. De Mooi has consistently denied any involvement in the man’s death, maintaining that he acted in self-defense during the encounter. The details of the incident remain unclear, but Dutch prosecutors had pursued legal action, leading to the extradition attempt.\n\nIn a recent statement, de Mooi expressed his relief at the extradition request's failure, emphasizing his willingness to engage fully with the ongoing investigation. \"I am grateful for the decision and remain committed to cooperating with the authorities to resolve this matter,\" he said. De Mooi also reiterated his innocence, urging for a fair and thorough examination of the facts.\n\nHis legal representatives have highlighted the lack of substantive evidence linking de Mooi to any wrongdoing, arguing that the case against him is weak. They have criticized the extradition attempt, describing it as an unnecessary strain on their client, who has already endured significant stress and anxiety due to the allegations.\n\nAs the investigation continues, de Mooi remains determined to clear his name. His case has garnered attention from both media and fans, many of whom have expressed support for the embattled quiz star. For now, de Mooi’s focus remains on proving his innocence as he navigates the complex legal proceedings ahead."

    "HWT": "Ryan Hinchcliffe's early try put Giants ahead but Ben Roberts, Jake Webster and Mike McMeeken crossed in response to put Tigers 16-4 ahead at the break. Gale and Adam Milner extended the lead before Ryan Brierley hit back. Two more tries from Gale in a 24-point contribution and a Monaghan treble followed as Tigers dominated. While Lee Gaskell added a further consolation try for Huddersfield in the second half, it did little more than add a semblance of respectability to the scoreline as they became the latest club to suffer a heavy loss at the Jungle. Castleford have scored at least 43 points in each of their first four home games in Super League this season. However, they were left to bemoan a series of handling errors after Hinchcliffe's try put Huddersfield ahead. That was before Roberts scooped up a neat grubber kick by Gale to help put the hosts ahead after 21 minutes. Huddersfield then saw their restart go out on the full, allowing Roberts the chance to quickly play provider for Webster as Tigers piled the points on. Gale gave Daryl Powell's side the ideal start to the second half, crossing for the first of his tries after just 30 seconds, as Castleford went on to win big to remain top. They are level on points with Leeds Rhinos, who beat Wigan 26-18 in Friday's other Super League game. Castleford Tigers: Hardaker; Monaghan, Webster, Shenton, Eden; Roberts, Gale; Sene-Lefao, McShane, Moors, Millington, McMeeken, Milner. Replacements: Cook, Springer, Chase, Holmes.

    "MGT": "Castleford Tigers showcased their dominance in the Super League with a commanding victory over Huddersfield Giants, as Luke Gale and Joel Monaghan delivered scintillating second-half performances to secure hat-tricks. The league leaders overwhelmed their struggling opponents, reinforcing their position at the top of the standings.\n\nHuddersfield entered the match with hopes of mounting a challenge, but Castleford's relentless pace and precision quickly dispelled any notions of an upset. The Tigers controlled the game from the outset, demonstrating their attacking prowess and defensive discipline. While Huddersfield managed to hold off the onslaught in the first half, the floodgates opened after the break.\n\nLuke Gale, Castleford's talismanic playmaker, orchestrated the Tigers' attack with clinical efficiency. He was at the heart of nearly every move, guiding his team forward and capitalizing on scoring opportunities. Gale's second-half hat-trick exemplified his ability to finish under pressure, leaving Huddersfield’s defense scrambling to contain him.\n\nJoel Monaghan complemented Gale’s brilliance with his own standout performance. The veteran winger proved unstoppable on the flanks, using his speed and experience to outmaneuver defenders and finish with precision. Monaghan's hat-trick came in rapid succession, further demoralizing the Giants and ensuring Castleford’s victory was emphatic.\n\nCastleford’s dominance was not limited to individual performances. The entire team contributed to their success, with fluid passing, cohesive teamwork, and a relentless drive to maintain their winning streak. Huddersfield, meanwhile, struggled to find answers against the Tigers' unyielding pressure. Their defense faltered repeatedly, and their attack lacked the cohesion needed to pose a significant threat.\n\nThe result solidifies Castleford’s position as Super League leaders and highlights their credentials as title contenders. For Huddersfield, the defeat serves as a reminder of the challenges they face in climbing out of the lower ranks. As the season progresses, Castleford's form remains a shining example of excellence in rugby league."

    "prompt": "Plans for a new rail link to Heathrow Airport as part of the HS2 high-speed network have been ruled out by the transport minister Patrick McLoughlin.",
    "HWT": "He was responding to a question by MP Dominic Grieve about the Heathrow spur. Mr McLoughlin said: \"I would now like to make clear that we do not intend to build the spur as part of Phase 1 or 2 of the HS2 scheme\". HS2 is a planned high-speed rail network from London to Birmingham, Manchester and Leeds. Previously the government had said any decision about the Heathrow spur would be delayed until the Davies Commission's report on future UK airport capacity had been completed. Responding to Mr Grieve's written Parliamentary question, the minister cited the Airports Commission review findings - published in November - which \"indicated that an HS2 spur is highly unlikely to be necessary to support any expansion of Heathrow airport\". Nick Hurd, Conservative MP for Ruislip, Northwood and Pinner tweeted he was \"delighted\" the government had dropped the idea and gave \"credit to ministers for listening to our argument\". He said the best way of connecting passengers to Heathrow was via Old Oak Common. He said it also simplified the case for extending the HS2 tunnel to protect Ickenham and Colne Valley. Paul Prentice, assistant news editor at Rail magazine said it was a \"very sensible decision. Bearing in mind there is already a spur tunnel to Heathrow and another western link being built\". Campaigner Lottie Jones from Hillingdon Against HS2 said the group was \"delighted\" with the decision but cautious that it was not \"just a pre-election sweetener\" that might be revoked.",
    "MGT": "The government has decided not to pursue plans for a new rail link connecting Heathrow Airport to the HS2 high-speed rail network, Transport Minister Patrick McLoughlin confirmed. The proposal, which had been under consideration as part of efforts to improve accessibility to one of the world’s busiest airports, has officially been ruled out, citing financial and logistical challenges.\n\nThe decision comes after years of debate over how best to integrate Heathrow into the UK’s growing rail infrastructure. HS2, which aims to significantly reduce travel times between London, the Midlands, and the North, has long been viewed as a transformative project for the nation’s transportation system. However, the absence of a direct link to Heathrow has raised concerns about whether the high-speed network would adequately serve travelers requiring seamless connections to international flights.\n\nMcLoughlin stated that while the government remains committed to enhancing transport links to Heathrow, the costs associated with extending HS2 to the airport were deemed prohibitive. He emphasized that alternatives, such as improved connections via existing rail services, could still provide efficient access to Heathrow for passengers using HS2.\n\nThe decision has drawn criticism from business leaders and regional officials, who argue that a rail connection to Heathrow is essential for maximizing the economic benefits of HS2. Proponents of the link believe it would boost tourism, trade, and investment by making Heathrow more accessible to travelers from across the country.\n\nDespite the setback, the government has pledged to continue exploring options for strengthening the airport’s connectivity in the future. For now, however, Heathrow's integration into the high-speed network has been shelved, leaving questions about the long-term vision for UK rail infrastructure unanswered."

But sales of its smartphones continued to decline. \"In the Mobile Communications segment, sales decreased primarily due to a significant decrease in smartphone unit sales resulting from a strategic decision not to pursue scale in order to improve profitability,\" the company said. Overall, its sales fell 0.5% to 1.8tn yen despite the uptick in demand for PS4 games and image sensors. Expecting to sell more PS4 consoles, Sony left its forecast for earnings for the year ending in March 2016 unchanged. \"Sales are expected to be higher than the July forecast primarily due to an expected increase in PS4 hardware unit sales and PS4 software sales,\" the company said. The earnings report comes a day after Sony announced that it would take over Toshiba's image sensor business.",
    "MGT": "Japanese technology conglomerate Sony has reported a significant turnaround in its financial performance, posting a net profit for the second quarter of its fiscal year. The company attributed the positive results to strong sales of its PlayStation 4 video games, which continue to dominate the gaming market.\n\nSony’s results highlight the growing importance of its gaming division, which has emerged as a key driver of revenue and profitability. The PlayStation 4, launched in 2013, has maintained its position as one of the best-selling consoles globally, with a robust lineup of exclusive titles and third-party game support bolstering sales. The demand for games and related services has surged, providing Sony with a substantial boost in earnings.\n\nThe company’s performance marks a shift from previous quarters, where profitability had been challenged by competition and fluctuating demand for some of its other product lines. Analysts credit Sony’s ability to capitalize on the booming gaming industry while streamlining operations across its divisions.\n\nSony’s strong results further underscore the enduring appeal of its PlayStation brand, which has become a cornerstone of the company’s strategy. As the gaming industry continues to expand, Sony appears well-positioned to maintain its leadership in the space, leveraging its innovative content and hardware to attract both avid gamers and casual players worldwide."

    "HWT": "The 35-year-old lost 4-6 7-6 (7-3) 4-6 to compatriot and world number 72 Madison Brengle in Auckland. Williams had returned to action after four months out on Tuesday, claiming she was 'rusty' despite winning. It was a disappointing day for the Williams sisters after older sister Venus withdrew with an arm injury. The 36-year-old beat New Zealand wildcard Jade Lewis 7-6 (7-2) 6-2 and was due to play Japan's Naomi Osaka in the second round later on Wednesday but pulled out before the match. Tournament director Karl Budge said that the seven-time Grand Slam winner \"wasn't able to serve as she would like to and at the level that we have come to expect from Venus and unfortunately that has taken her away from the tournament this year\". Venus later posted a message on Twitter thanking her supporters. Britain's Naomi Broady won her opening match at the tournament before suffering a second-round exit. Broady, ranked 90 in the world, beat Danka Kovinic of Montenegro 7-6 (7-5) 6-3 to ensure she remains in the top 100.

    "MGT": "World number two Serena Williams faced an unexpected setback in her comeback journey after injury, losing in the second round of the ASB Classic in New Zealand. The tennis star, who had been eagerly anticipated to make a strong return to the court, was defeated in a surprising upset by an unseeded opponent.\n\nWilliams, known for her dominance and resilience, struggled to find her rhythm throughout the match.

    "prompt": "A new 1,000-space lorry park to help reduce congestion from queuing lorries on the M20 and in Dover has local support, an MP says.",
    "HWT": "Charlie Elphicke, Conservative MP for Dover and Deal, said Shepway District Council supported the plans for a smaller lorry park at Westenhanger. The council's leader had previously branded a proposed 3,300-space lorry park as \"bonkers\". Lorries are allowed to park on the M20 when there are delays at Channel ports. The proposed lorry park is aimed at relieving pressure caused by Operation Stack, when trucks are allowed to queue due to delays at Channel Tunnel and ferry ports. Mr Elphicke said: \"We've had major problems in Dover in recent months because of the level of gridlock, which is a weekly occurrence. \"We need a long term solution. There is a site near Folkestone which could be the site with up to 1,000 lorry parking spaces. \"[Shepway] District Council is supportive and I'm making the case it should be advance check-in, before lorries go down to the Eastern Docks. \"There would be 1,000 spaces in the Eastern Docks and 1,000 spaces near Folkestone which would be enough capacity not to cause gridlock in Dover.\" A spokeswoman said Shepway council was \"driving plans\" for a lorry park with about 1,000 spaces. She said the authority was looking at land near Westenhanger and was talking to local land owners. Councillor Paul Carter, Conservative leader of Kent County Council, said problems arising from Operation Stack were \"intolerable\" to the people of Kent. He said: \"We need national government to fund what is needed to get the private sector to operate those lorry parks. \"Recently, the government introduced charging for foreign lorries using our roads, and I believe a substantial amount of the money should be used to fund these lorry parks.\"",
    "MGT": "A new 1,000-space lorry park is set to be developed to address ongoing congestion issues caused by queuing lorries on the M20 motorway and in the port town of Dover. The initiative has received strong backing from local residents and authorities, according to a local Member of Parliament. The project is intended to alleviate the traffic disruptions that have long plagued the area, especially during periods of heightened freight activity.\n\nThe MP emphasized the importance of the lorry park in improving traffic flow and reducing the strain on local infrastructure. Queuing lorries have been a persistent problem for years, particularly in the wake of increased trade and logistical demands. The congestion has not only affected drivers but also caused significant inconveniences for residents and businesses in the surrounding areas. The proposed facility is viewed as a practical solution to mitigate these challenges.\n\nLocal support for the lorry park stems from the belief that it will provide a more organized system for managing freight traffic. Residents have expressed optimism that the facility will help restore normalcy to roads that are often clogged with stationary trucks. Business owners in Dover are also hopeful that the initiative will enhance the efficiency of transportation in the region, thus benefiting the local economy.\n\nWhile details about the timeline for construction and operations have not been finalized, the announcement has been welcomed as a step in the right direction. The MP assured constituents that the lorry park would be designed to minimize environmental impact while maximizing its utility for drivers and the community.\n\nThe project highlights the government’s commitment to addressing infrastructure concerns in areas critical to the UK’s trade and logistics network. With local backing firmly in place, stakeholders are optimistic that the lorry park will bring much-needed relief to the M20 and Dover, paving the way for smoother traffic and improved quality of life for residents."

    "HWT": "The England coach has picked United's Marcus Rashford, 19, in his squad. The teenage striker will now miss the Under-21 European Championship this summer - something Mourinho wanted. \"I'm not in a position where I can make decisions to keep people happy. I'm not going to achieve that,\" said Southgate. \"The key is not the relationship with Jose, it's the relationship with Marcus. I didn't speak to him [Mourinho] about it. I let him know where I was heading at the end.\" Mourinho said last month Rashford should not go to the Euros as \"it does not make a lot of sense to drop levels\". The FA previously indicated young players needed tournament experience. Rashford has instead been called up for the World Cup qualifier against Scotland on 10 June and the friendly against France three days later. He played 58 games for United and England this season, scoring 11 goals, having broken into his club's first-team last term. Just four months into his first professional season in February 2016, he was selected for Euro 2016 by England manager Roy Hodgson and has gone on to win eight caps. Rashford led the line in United's Europa League final win over Ajax and came on in the EFL Cup final triumph over Southampton. Southgate said he \"wants a good working relationship with the clubs\" but has to make decisions \"that are right for England\". The former international defender added: \"I have got to make decisions that are right for England seniors long term, I'm always mindful of what is right for the players. \"Respectfully, none of the managers are going to be around in 10 years, or it's very, very unlikely, and I think people like Marcus Rashford will be. \"So there's always going to be some collision at some point on that and some disagreement on that.\"",
    "MGT": "England manager Gareth Southgate has addressed the challenges of balancing international responsibilities with maintaining harmony among Premier League club managers, particularly Manchester United boss José Mourinho. Southgate admitted that keeping Mourinho satisfied would be “fairly difficult,” emphasizing that his primary commitment lies with making decisions that serve the best interest of the England national team.\n\nThe remarks came amid ongoing discussions about the use of players during international breaks, with club managers often expressing concerns over their stars’ fitness and workload. Mourinho, known for his outspoken nature, has previously voiced frustrations regarding the handling of Manchester United players by their respective national teams. However, Southgate was steadfast in his stance, stating that his priority remains the well-being and success of the England squad.\n\n“I’m not going to make decisions based on trying to keep José happy. That would be fairly difficult, I think,” Southgate said. “My responsibility is to make decisions that are right for England. I have to consider what’s best for the team and the players while they’re with us.”\n\nThe England manager has faced scrutiny in the past over the usage of certain players, particularly during matches deemed less critical in the international calendar. Mourinho has been vocal about his concerns over player fatigue and injuries, which can disrupt club performances. Southgate, however, insisted that he operates with the players’ best interests at heart, working collaboratively with club medical teams to ensure their well-being.\n\n“I understand the position of club managers, and I always try to maintain good relationships with them,” Southgate added. “We’re mindful of the players’ workloads and take every precaution to manage them responsibly. But ultimately, my job is to prepare the team for success on the international stage.”\n\nThe relationship between national team managers and club bosses has long been a delicate balancing act, with both parties vying for optimal conditions for their players. Despite the challenges, Southgate remains focused on his mission to guide England to further success, highlighting his determination to prioritize the needs of the national team over external pressures.\n\nAs England continues its preparations for upcoming fixtures, Southgate’s comments underline the complexities of managing elite players in the modern game while navigating the expectations of club managers like Mourinho."

    "HWT": "Volodymyr Demchyshyn said on Wednesday that one of the reactors at the Zaporizhzhya plant in the south of Ukraine had automatically shut down. There was no problem with the reactor itself and the problem would be fixed by the weekend, he added. Zaporizhzhya produces more than one-fifth of Ukraine's electricity. The operator of the nuclear plant, Energoatom, had reported a problem with the power plant on Friday. But the details were not fully disclosed until a cabinet meeting on Wednesday when Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk asked the energy minister to report on what had happened. Mr Demchyshyn said that damage to a transformer in a power-generating unit had triggered an automatic shutdown of one of the six 1,000 MW reactors. He added that there was \"no threat\" to the safety of the reactor. The French Institute for Radiological Protection and Nuclear Safety (IRSN) told Reuters that their sensors had not detected anything unusual in Ukraine. Michel Chouha, IRSN's special representative for Central and Eastern Europe, said: \"If there was an accident, we would know.\" The drop in electricity production has left several dozen towns and villages without electricity, Russian media reported. Ukraine's energy industry is already under pressure because of a fuel shortage. Mr Demchyshyn said that Ukraine will probably have to import power from Russia this winter. He called it a \"necessary step\" despite how \"politically problematic it might be\". Last year Ukraine was self-sufficient in electricity but the conflict with pro-Russian rebels in the east of the country has severely hit coal production. Ukraine has already agreed a $4.6bn package of gas supplies from Russia, ending months of wrangling with Moscow over prices.",
    "MGT": "Ukraine’s energy minister has announced that a technical fault at the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, Europe’s largest nuclear facility, has led to a reduction in power production. The issue, however, does not pose any danger to public safety or the environment, according to officials.\n\nThe plant, located in southeastern Ukraine, has long been a critical component of the nation’s energy infrastructure, supplying significant amounts of electricity to the region. The technical fault, which was detected earlier this week, has temporarily disrupted operations, but authorities have emphasized that all safety protocols are being strictly adhered to.\n\n“There is no threat to the population or the environment. The situation is under control, and the fault is being addressed by our technical teams,” the minister stated during a briefing. While specific details about the nature of the fault were not disclosed, experts at the facility are reportedly working around the clock to resolve the issue and restore normal operations.\n\nThe Zaporizhzhia plant has been in the spotlight in recent years due to its strategic importance and proximity to areas of conflict. Despite the challenges, Ukrainian officials have consistently assured the public of the facility’s robust safety measures. International nuclear monitoring organizations also continue to observe operations at the plant closely.\n\nEnergy experts predict that the temporary reduction in power output may have minor effects on the local energy grid but stress that Ukraine’s energy reserves are sufficient to meet current demands. The incident serves as a reminder of the importance of maintaining rigorous oversight and ensuring the reliability of critical infrastructure.\n\nAs repairs progress, Ukraine’s energy ministry has pledged to provide regular updates to keep the public informed. The swift response to the fault underscores the government’s commitment to transparency and the safe operation of one of the region’s most vital energy assets."

    "prompt": "The centre-left coalition of Prime Minister Victor Ponta has swept to victory in Romania's general election.",
    "HWT": "The Social Liberal Union (USL) won nearly 60% of the vote, with four-fifths of ballots counted. The Right Romania Alliance (ARD) of centre-right President Traian Basescu came a distant second with about 17%. The result could open the door to a constitutional crisis, as the president has previously hinted he may refuse to reappoint his arch-rival Mr Ponta. Mr Ponta said: \"This is a clear victory with an absolute majority.\" But, if he resumes as prime minister, he will have to share power with Mr Basescu, whose term runs until 2014. The pair have been locked in a power struggle since Mr Ponta came to power in April following the collapse of the previous centre-right government. The two men have argued over control of state television and the Romanian Cultural Institute and attempts to draw up a new electoral law. But, says the BBC's correspondent in the region Nick Thorpe, the political feud often seems to have more to do with the vanity of the main players than with genuine differences in policy. Their antagonism has meant political decision-making has at times been paralysed. In July, Mr Ponta suspended Mr Basescu and tried to impeach him. But a referendum failed to meet the required turnout. Mr Basescu hinted before the election that he might refuse to re-appoint Mr Ponta as prime minister. He has described him as a \"mythomaniac\". Mr Basescu's popularity has plummeted since he introduced stringent austerity measures and a 25% cut in public sector pay. Romania is the second poorest member of the European Union, which it joined in 2007 with Bulgaria. The country, together with neighbour Bulgaria, are under special EU monitoring because of concerns about judicial independence, corruption and political influence in state institutions. Romania is trying to negotiate a new loan from the IMF to replace the existing one which expires early next year.",
    "MGT": "Romania's centre-left coalition, led by Prime Minister Victor Ponta, secured a decisive victory in the country's general election, solidifying its position as the dominant political force. The election outcome reflects widespread support for Ponta's leadership and policies, offering his coalition a strong mandate to govern in the years ahead.\n\nThe Social Liberal Union (USL), Ponta's alliance of social democrats and liberals, garnered a significant share of the vote, surpassing expectations and leaving opposition parties trailing far behind. Preliminary results indicate the coalition won over 60% of the parliamentary seats, ensuring it will have a comfortable majority to pass legislation and implement its agenda without significant resistance.\n\nVictor Ponta, who has served as prime minister since May 2012, vowed to continue addressing Romania's economic challenges and pressing social issues. His administration has been credited with measures to stabilize the economy and improve public services, resonating strongly with voters across the country. In his post-election remarks, Ponta expressed gratitude for the trust placed in him and his coalition, promising to focus on unity and progress.\n\nThe election was closely watched, with many viewing it as a pivotal moment for Romania's political landscape. The centre-right opposition, led by President Traian Băsescu's Democratic Liberal Party (PDL), suffered a significant defeat, highlighting a shift in public sentiment. Analysts suggest that ongoing tensions between Ponta and Băsescu played a role in shaping voter preferences, with many favoring the prime minister's approach over the president's.\n\nDespite the USL's victory, challenges lie ahead for the new government. The coalition must navigate a complex relationship with President Băsescu, whose term continues until 2014. The two leaders have clashed frequently over policy and governance, raising concerns about potential political gridlock. However, Ponta struck a conciliatory tone following the election, emphasizing the need for collaboration to serve the country's best interests.\n\nRomania now looks to the future with Ponta's coalition firmly at the helm. As the country seeks to strengthen its economy and integrate further into the European Union, the newly elected government faces the task of delivering on its promises and maintaining the confidence of the electorate."

    "HWT": "Peers voted by 327 to 234, to give a majority of 93 to a Labour motion forcing the plans to be debated by a cross party select committee. Labour fears it could lose Â£6m a year under the Trade Union Bill proposals. Labour's Baroness Smith of Basildon rejected government claims the bill would not hurt her party financially. She told peers democracy would be damaged if the government pushed through the changes on funding without them being scrutinised by a select committee first. As it stands, the legislation would require Labour-affiliated union members to \"opt in\" to paying a levy to the party instead of having it automatically deducted. Lady Smith said: \"Our genuinely held concern is that this aspect of the bill will have a significant impact on the resources of one major political party - my party, the Labour Party. \"And in doing so, it will both disrupt the political balance in the UK and have a damaging effect on the electoral process and our democracy.\" Conservative and Lib Dem peers suggested the government should rethink its proposals. Tory peer Lord Forsyth said: \"It will take away funding from the Labour Party at a time when the Labour Party is perhaps not at its strongest... our Parliamentary system does depend upon having a strong and effective opposition.\" Labour is also reported to be set to lose out by about Â£1.3m a year when state funding for opposition parties - known as Short money - is cut. Junior business minister Baroness Neville-Rolfe, responding for the government, said Labour's motion would shift the focus of scrutiny on the Bill to party funding and away from its central purpose of trade union reform. She added: \"This Bill is a package of measures and it's disappointing that the party opposite has chosen to misinterpret our intentions.\"",
    "MGT": "The government may need to reconsider its proposed plans to limit trade union funding of political parties following a significant defeat in the House of Lords. The controversial measures, part of broader reforms to political funding, sparked fierce debate among lawmakers and union representatives, ultimately leading to their rejection by peers in the upper chamber.\n\nCritics of the plan argued that it would disproportionately impact trade unions and their ability to support political campaigns, particularly those of the Labour Party, which has historically relied on union contributions. Opponents claim the move undermines democratic principles and is an attempt to stifle opposition voices. Supporters, however, maintained that the reforms were necessary to ensure transparency in political donations and to level the playing field across all parties.\n\nThe defeat in the Lords marks a significant setback for the government, which had championed the changes as part of its broader agenda to reform political funding and reduce undue influence from any single source. However, the proposals faced intense scrutiny, with many peers warning that the measures could have far-reaching implications for the political landscape and democratic engagement.\n\nIn the wake of the defeat, union leaders have expressed relief, stating that the decision underscores the importance of protecting the ability of workers to collectively support political causes. They argue that the proposals would have not only silenced unions but also weakened the voice of millions of working people in political discourse.\n\nThe government now faces pressure to revise its approach or abandon the plans altogether. Observers suggest that ministers may need to engage in further consultation with unions and opposition parties to address the concerns raised during the parliamentary debates.\n\nThis latest development highlights ongoing tensions surrounding political funding reforms, with the government’s defeat in the Lords serving as a reminder of the challenges it faces in implementing contentious policies. As discussions continue, the future of trade union funding and its role in British politics remains uncertain."

    "HWT": "South Lakes Safari Zoo in Dalton said it would be closed from 9 January. Barrow Borough Council raised several concerns about the zoo, including the closeness of the rhino dung to a fence, and the safety of walkways. Zoo bosses said they felt \"harassed\" by the council and were unable to continue under such conditions. On Thursday Barrow Council's licensing committee issued an order to the zoo to prove within 28 days that the aerial walkways were safe. Zoo inspector Matthew Brash showed the council pictures of rotting timbers and said he and his colleagues had noted 20 slips and trips on them from the zoo's accident book. But Karen Brewer, from the zoo, said there was only one accident listed in 2015 and two in 2014. The council also said a pile of rhino dung was too close to a fence, providing a possible escape route for baboons, although the zoo said there had never been a baboon escape in 16 years of the dung being piled there. In a statement, the zoo said: \"We assure everyone that the zoo is safe and there is no evidence whatsoever to say otherwise. \"We are being subjected to an unprecedented attack and attempt to undermine our credibility and professionalism at every chance created. \"The management team cannot work under these conditions and hence the decisions made.\"",
    "MGT": "A zoo in Cumbria has announced its closure following concerns raised by local councillors about the risk of baboons escaping their enclosure. The concerns stemmed from a peculiar issue involving a pile of rhino dung that had accumulated near the primates' habitat. Officials feared the baboons could potentially use the mound to scale their enclosure, creating a significant safety risk for both visitors and the surrounding community.\n\nThe situation came to light during a recent council meeting, where the zoo’s safety protocols were scrutinized. Councillors expressed unease over the possibility of the highly intelligent and agile animals exploiting the unusual terrain within the enclosure. While there were no reported incidents of escapes, the council emphasized the need for proactive measures to prevent such a scenario.\n\nIn response to the concerns, the zoo’s management announced the difficult decision to close its doors. In a statement, they explained that addressing the issue would require extensive structural modifications, which were deemed financially unviable for the facility. The management also stressed that the welfare of the animals remained their top priority and that plans were underway to rehome all the zoo’s residents to other accredited wildlife institutions.\n\nThe closure marks the end of an era for the zoo, which had been a popular local attraction for years. While some residents expressed disappointment over the decision, many supported the council’s stance, citing the importance of public safety. As the zoo prepares to shut down, efforts are being made to find suitable environments for the animals to thrive."

In their past 17 meetings with the other top-six sides away from home, Pochettino's team have won just once. \"In the first 45 minutes you saw a team that is not ready to fight for the Premier League,\" the Argentine told BT Sport. \"We are in a position that is up to us.

Liverpool showed that today, and we didn’t,\" he added. \"We need to take responsibility and learn from this if we want to take the next step as a team.\"\n\nTottenham struggled to create clear-cut chances throughout the match, with Harry Kane and Son Heung-min largely kept quiet by Liverpool’s solid defense. Despite a slight improvement in the second half, the damage had already been done, and Pochettino’s side left Merseyside empty-handed.\n\nAs the season progresses, Pochettino faces the challenge of reigniting the fighting spirit within his squad, knowing that performances like the one at Anfield will not be enough to compete with the league’s elite."

    "HWT": "She was attacked outside a women's hostel in Lucknow while getting water from a hand pump, police said. The woman, 35, had been receiving round-the-clock police protection because of the previous attacks, which were linked to a property dispute. Anger is growing at the authorities' inability to protect her. She was allegedly gang-raped and first attacked with acid by two men in 2008, over a property dispute, the details of which are not clear. The same two men are then accused of throwing acid at her twice more - in 2012 and 2013 - to try and get her to drop the criminal charges against them. In March, she was attacked again while travelling on a train with her daughter. This time she was forced to drink acid. Two men are facing trial for all of the attacks but were released on bail in April, the AFP agency reports. According to government figures, there are hundreds of such attacks involving acid each year in India, although campaigners say the real figures are much higher. The victims, who have to live with terrible disfigurements, are mainly women and are often targeted by jealous partners, campaigners say. Despite a Supreme Court ruling in 2013 to regulate the sale of acid, critics say it is still widely and easily available.",
    "MGT": "In a shocking recurrence of violence, a woman in Uttar Pradesh, India, who has survived a series of brutal attacks, has been targeted once more by an acid-thrower. The victim, whose identity remains protected for her safety, has faced unimaginable threats over the past years, beginning with an alleged gang-rape followed by four separate acid attacks. Despite these harrowing experiences, she has shown extraordinary resilience and courage in the face of adversity.\n\nThe latest attack took place in her hometown, where an assailant threw acid on her, causing significant injuries. The motive behind this heinous act remains unclear, but it underscores the persistent threat she faces and highlights the urgent need for stronger protective measures for victims of violence. Authorities have launched an investigation to apprehend the perpetrator and ensure the safety of the victim. This incident draws attention to the broader issue of violence against women in India, where acid attacks and sexual violence are alarmingly prevalent.\n\nThe woman's story has sparked widespread outrage and calls for justice, with activists urging more stringent laws and better enforcement to prevent such attacks. Her plight serves as a grim reminder of the ongoing struggles faced by women in India, where gender-based violence continues to be a pervasive problem. As the investigation unfolds, there is hope that her courage will inspire change and lead to greater protection and support for victims of such atrocities, ensuring they can live without fear of further attacks."

    "MGT": "Shares in Travis Perkins, the UK-based DIY and building materials supplier, experienced a sharp decline on the FTSE 100 following the company’s announcement of a profits warning. The group attributed the situation to challenging market conditions and weaker-than-expected consumer demand in the home improvement sector, which is grappling with ongoing economic uncertainty. \n\nTravis Perkins, a key player in the DIY and construction industry, noted that sales growth had been significantly hindered by rising costs and cautious spending behavior among its customer base. The company’s leadership emphasized that they are taking proactive measures to navigate the difficult environment, including cost-saving initiatives and a review of their operational strategies. \n\nThe profit warning caused investor sentiment to sour, leading to a drop in the company’s stock price and weighing on the broader FTSE 100 index. Analysts have expressed concerns that Travis Perkins’ struggles could reflect wider challenges in the construction and home improvement markets, as consumers and businesses alike face inflationary pressures and economic headwinds."

Chelsea, who host Middlesbrough on Monday, need two wins from their final four games to be crowned champions. \"It is not over. We have to wait but are thinking that it will be difficult to catch Chelsea,\" said Pochettino. \"I feel calm. But I'm disappointed, of course, that we missed the opportunity to reduce the gap.\" Chelsea have long looked on course to win their second Premier League title in three seasons, having led since mid-November. But Spurs' nine-match winning streak in the league, coupled with defeats for the Blues by Crystal Palace and Manchester United, gave them hope of a first title since 1961. They could have narrowed the gap on the Blues to just one point by beating West Ham, but produced a below-par performance. Antonio Conte's men will open up a seven-point gap if they beat Boro - and could win the title on Friday, 12 May. \"Seven points will be difficult with three games to play, but in football have to try your best.

    "HWT": "Russia's FBI-style Investigative Committee (SK) confined him to Moscow after questioning him about an alleged plot to seize power in Russia. Mr Udaltsov denied the allegations and said a \"new repression\" was under way. Elsewhere, President Vladimir Putin sacked one of his ministers after publicly criticising him last month. No reason was given for dismissing Regional Development Minister Oleg Govorun and replacing him with Igor Slyunyayev. However, last month, in a dressing-down broadcast on TV, the Russian leader rebuked Mr Govorun for failing to deliver on his election promises to help people living in sub-standard housing in the regions. An unnamed Kremlin source quoted by Russian business newspaper Vedomosti said the main reason for Mr Putin's dissatisfaction was Mr Govorun's poor handling of the Krymsk flood disaster clean-up. Along with Mr Udaltsov, at least two other people were also placed under investigation by the SK. In Twitter messages, Mr Udaltsov, a radical leftist, said his apartment had been searched and he had been taken to SK headquarters for interrogation. \"This is lawlessness and provocation and I hope that society will not be silent,\" he was quoted as saying by Russia's Interfax news agency. A documentary last week on Russia's NTV channel, which is seen as close to the Kremlin, showed what it said was footage of the activist meeting officials from Georgia to discuss mounting a coup in Russia. In a statement released on Wednesday, the SK said it had begun an investigation into Mr Udaltsov, Leonid Razvozzhayev, Konstantin Lebedev and others on the basis of the allegations made in the documentary, Anatomy Of A Protest II. If convicted, Mr Udaltsov and the others face prison sentences of between four and 10 years. Correction, 19 October 2012:This story originally said that Mr Udaltsov had been placed under house arrest but it has now been clarified that he has been barred from leaving Moscow.",
    "MGT": "Sergei Udaltsov, a prominent figure in Russia's anti-Putin protest movement, has been barred from leaving the country by Moscow investigators. The decision comes as authorities continue to crack down on dissent, targeting opposition leaders and activists who have vocally criticized Vladimir Putin's government and policies.\n\nUdaltsov, known for his fiery speeches and steadfast commitment to challenging the Kremlin, has long been a thorn in the side of Russian authorities. His leadership in protests and public demonstrations has made him one of the most recognizable faces of the movement opposing Putin's regime. However, his activism has also made him a frequent target of legal and political pressure, with the latest travel ban marking yet another chapter in his contentious relationship with the state.\n\nThe travel restriction was reportedly imposed as part of an ongoing investigation into Udaltsov's activities. While the specific details of the investigation have not been disclosed, the move is widely seen as an effort to limit his ability to connect with international allies and raise awareness about the political situation in Russia. Critics argue that such measures are designed to stifle dissent and isolate opposition leaders from global support.\n\nUdaltsov has responded to the ban by condemning it as politically motivated. In a brief statement, he accused authorities of attempting to silence him and other critics of the government. \"This is yet another attempt to suppress those who dare to speak out against the regime,\" Udaltsov said. \"But we will not be intimidated.\"\n\nThe travel ban comes at a tense time for Russia, as protests and public dissatisfaction with the government continue to simmer. In recent years, the Kremlin has ramped up efforts to suppress dissent, including arrests, restrictions on free speech, and actions targeting opposition figures. Udaltsov's case highlights the increasingly precarious position of activists advocating for change in Russia.\n\nDespite the challenges, Udaltsov has vowed to continue his work within the country, calling on supporters to remain steadfast in their efforts to push for democratic reforms. His determination in the face of mounting pressure underscores the resilience of Russia's opposition movement, even as it faces significant obstacles."

Northern Ireland's transport minister Michelle McIlveen said that up to £400m will be spent on the 18 mile stretch between Derry and Dungiven. It is expected to be allocated during the budget period up to 2021. There is no indication as to when the work will begin. Ms McIlveen said on Wednesday that the announcement is good news for the north-west. \"The A6 is a key transport route and the construction of a new dual carriageway will help to reduce journey times and improve road safety,\" she said. \"There is no doubt that this scheme represents a significant investment in our economy and will create hundreds of jobs.\" Sinn Féin MLA Cathal Ó hOisín said the announcement was a tremendous boost for the entire region. \"The campaign to have the A6 transformed into a dual carriageway and the creation of a bypass at Dungiven has taken many years but we are now seeing light at the end of the tunnel. \"It will be a major factor in improving the economic fortunes of the region and the bypass of Dungiven will have a major environmental impact on the town.\" Last month, Ms McIlveen said work would start later this year on on dualling the section of the A6 between Randalstown and Castledawson.",

Officials have highlighted the potential benefits of the upgrade, including reduced travel times and economic stimulation for the region.\n\nThe proposed dual carriageway spans a distance of approximately 25.5 kilometers. It would replace the existing single carriageway, which has long been criticized for its inability to accommodate increasing traffic volumes. Advocates of the project argue that the new road will improve road safety and provide a vital boost to local communities and businesses by facilitating smoother transit.\n\nHowever, the approval comes with a caveat: the £400m in funding required to bring the plan to fruition has yet to be secured. Government officials have acknowledged the financial uncertainty surrounding the project and emphasized that its implementation will depend on the availability of resources. While the decision represents a significant step forward, the timeline for construction remains unclear.\n\nThe A6 dual carriageway has been in discussion for years, with many residents and commuters expressing frustration over delays. Despite this, there is cautious optimism that the project will move forward as funding arrangements are finalized. For now, the green light serves as a symbol of progress, though the region continues to wait for definitive action to turn the plans into reality."

Servicemen received treatment, rehabilitation and training there. Pavilion Blues: Disability and Identity has brought together patients' experiences with photographs, poetry and objects from the hospital. One of the patients was Albert Clay, a corporal in Sherwood Foresters (Nottingham & Derbyshire) Regiment. He was seriously injured by shrapnel at Ypres and lost his right leg. Researcher Jo Palache said letters and telegrams from France told his long and difficult journey to the Pavilion Military Hospital. She said he was first treated at a dressing station bunker and then he had a blood transfusion at a clearing station but still had his leg amputated. He went on to be treated at a hospital in Boulogne before he was moved to Brighton. There he had three more operations. His granddaughter Yvonne Clay visited the exhibition on Saturday. She said 6,000 amputees stayed on the Pavilion estate and urged relatives of World War One servicemen to get in touch with their stories. \"My granddad was there for six months and we had no idea he was there, that he stayed in a palace,\" she added.

Featuring photographs, personal letters, and artifacts from the era, the display highlights the stories of the soldiers who passed through its doors. Visitors can learn about the unique cultural adaptations made to ensure the comfort of Indian soldiers, including the provision of prayer spaces and dietary adjustments.\n\nCurators hope the exhibition will shed light on a lesser-known chapter of the Pavilion's history, illustrating its impact beyond its reputation as a royal retreat. \"The Pavilion's role as a hospital is a poignant reminder of its connection to global history,\" said a spokesperson for Brighton Museum. \"It gave sanctuary to those who fought and suffered during one of humanity's darkest periods.\"\n\nThe exhibition also examines the broader narrative of Brighton’s contribution during the war, offering insights into how the city mobilized to support the war effort.

But he was convicted at a trial at Swansea Magistrates' Court on Wednesday. He claimed he believed he was the owner of the garage as the issue had not been challenged in over 20 years. He was fined £200. He was also ordered to pay £250 in compensation to the legal owner of the garage who had registered it with the Land Registry, unlike Phillips. He must also pay £2,000 in legal costs and a surcharge of £20 after being found guilty of depositing wood without an environmental permit. Defence barrister Ben Blakemore called on a number of witnesses, including residents of Oakfield Terrace who admitted to assuming Phillips was the only user of the garage but that they had not known who legally owned it. In mitigation, Mr Blakemore added: \"What we have here is not an offence being committed but a matter of ignorance.\" District Judge, Sophie Toms, told Phillips: \"I accept your good character and your role in the community and desire to improve it.\"",

This illegal activity was discovered following a tip-off from local residents who noticed unusual activity in the area. Investigations led to the former leader, whose actions were described by the prosecution as a \"blatant disregard for environmental laws.\"\n\nThe defense argued that the former leader was unaware of the legal requirements for waste disposal, a claim the court rejected. The judge emphasized the importance of adhering to environmental regulations, especially for those in positions of authority, and underscored the need for accountability.\n\nThis conviction has sparked a wave of criticism and disappointment from the community, with many expressing their dismay at the breach of trust. The council has since reiterated its commitment to upholding environmental standards and ensuring no one is above the law."

Mr Jarrah founded the independent citizen journalist group ANA Press, providing reports to international media, after leaving Syria. Rami Jarrah: 'Total chaos and crisis in Aleppo' He was initially held in a detention facility for foreign citizens, but was moved to a different facility on Thursday and it was not clear where he was currently being held, the CPJ said. He was questioned about his work, but was given access to a lawyer and had not been charged with any crime, the group added. \"Syrian journalists like Jarrah, who have turned to Turkey for safe refuge, should be protected rather than subjected to detention and harassment,\" said CPJ co-ordinator Nina Ognianova.

It was magical,\" lamented long-time resident Margaret Hayes. \"This year, it feels like the council has sucked all the joy out of the holidays.\"\n\nThe council, however, defended its decision, citing budget constraints and a desire to reduce energy consumption as the primary reasons for the scaled-back display. Council member Thomas Greer explained that the decision was made with the town's best interests in mind, aiming to balance festive spirit with fiscal responsibility and environmental consciousness.\n\n\"We understand the community's concerns, and it wasn't an easy decision,\" Greer stated. \"But we have to consider our budgetary limitations and the environmental impact. We believe it's important to celebrate responsibly.\"\n\nDespite the council's explanation, the residents' grievances have made their way to social media, where the hashtag #MiddletonScrooges has gained traction. This online movement has become a platform for many to share their disappointment, with some even calling for a return to the town's previous splendor in future years.\n\nAs the debate continues, Middleton's streets remain lit with the council's modest display, leaving locals to find creative ways to ignite their holiday spirit and keep the magic of Christmas alive in their hearts."

    "HWT": "Halfpenny has been at Toulon since 2014 but is out of contract in the summer. And while the 27-year-old may opt to return home to Wales, Dominguez is adamant he should stay in France if he is to keep developing his game. \"We speak very often with him about [his future], and I am confident he will stay,\" Dominguez said. \"I think for him it will be the best decision to be outside [Wales], to challenge the best every week. \"I respect him as a person so I have told him this, not as a coach, but as personal advice.\" Halfpenny joined Toulon from Cardiff Blues from the 2014-15 campaign and was a Heineken Cup winner at the end of his first season with the club. Under the terms of the Welsh Rugby Union's senior player selection policy, Halfpenny will have to rely on a wildcard pick if he is to play for the national side. Interim head coach Rob Howley hopes the ruling will encourage those based overseas to return to a region. It is understood Halfpenny remains open-minded about his future, and is concentrating on reaching peak form and fitness after missing the bulk of last season with a serious knee injury. However Dominguez, the former Italy fly-half, believes the player will soon be back to his best. \"It is never simple to come back but Leigh is coming back very well. He is very professional. I have no doubt he will come back 100% as he was before the injury,\" Dominguez told BBC Radio 5 live. \"He is happy at the club, he is having a good time. This year he is much more open, he is making new friends in France, speaking French. \"He hasn't made the decision yet, but I will be very happy if he stays and the club will be very happy if he stays.\" Halfpenny confirmed in September he will be available for the British and Irish Lions tour of New Zealand next summer. He said Toulon will allow him to miss the Top 14 finals to join up with the Lions should he be selected.",
    "MGT": "Toulon head coach Diego Dominguez has expressed optimism about Leigh Halfpenny's future with the club, stating he is confident the Wales and British & Irish Lions full-back will remain in Toulon for another season.\n\nHalfpenny, who joined the French side in 2014, has become a key player for the team, earning praise for his consistent performances and reliability under pressure. Despite ongoing speculation about his long-term commitment to Toulon, Dominguez believes the 27-year-old star will continue to contribute to the side's success in the Top 14 and European competitions.\n\n\"Leigh is a fantastic player and a great professional,\" Dominguez said in a recent interview. \"He has shown his value to Toulon time and time again, and I am confident that he will stay with us next year. He is happy here, and we are happy with him.\"\n\nHalfpenny's contract with Toulon is set to expire at the end of the season, prompting rumors about a potential return to Wales or a move to another club. However, Dominguez's remarks suggest negotiations are progressing positively, and the club is keen to retain the experienced full-back.\n\nThe Welshman has been a crucial part of Toulon's squad, helping them secure vital victories with his precision kicking and defensive prowess. His contributions have not gone unnoticed, with fans and teammates alike recognizing him as one of the world's best full-backs.\n\nWhile Halfpenny has yet to make a public statement about his future, Dominguez's confidence will likely reassure Toulon supporters eager to see the star player continue wearing the club's colors. With the season underway, the focus for both Halfpenny and the team remains firmly on delivering strong performances and competing for silverware.\n\nAs the situation unfolds, Toulon supporters will be watching closely, hoping their celebrated full-back chooses to extend his successful tenure with the club."

    "HWT": "Paul Cummins received threats by email, phone and letter over plans for services charities to benefit from the Â£10m raised, he told the Sunday Times. The Derbyshire artist said he believed it was because some people felt the charities were \"involved in war\". Blood Swept Lands And Seas Of Red saw 888,246 ceramic poppies \"planted\" in the moat. Each poppy represented one British or colonial military death during World War One. The installation culminated on Armistice Day when the final poppy was planted by 13-year old cadet Harry Hayes from Berkshire, before the guns were fired 21 times and a two-minute silence was observed. Mr Cummins said: \"The threats came, I suppose, because they felt that the money was going to charities which in some way were involved in war.\" He added that police had been called in over the matter. It is thought about five million people visited Blood-Swept Lands and Seas of Red, the title of which was inspired by a line from the will of a Derbyshire serviceman who died in Flanders. He had described \"the blood-swept lands and seas of red, where angels fear to tread\". The following day a team of 8,000 volunteers started removing the 888,246 poppies and sending them to the people who bought them for Â£25 each. The net proceeds plus 10% of every sale generated the Â£10m being shared between Help for Heroes, the Royal British Legion, Combat Stress, Cobseo, Coming Home and SSAFA. Mr Cummins also told the paper he was working on a new British-based project involving ceramic tulips, although the location is yet to be disclosed. He added that he had had offers to work on projects elsewhere in Europe as well as another \"distant part of the world\". World War One Centenary",
    "MGT": "Paul Cummins, the renowned artist behind the iconic poppy installation at the Tower of London, has disclosed that he received death threats following the exhibition's immense success. The poignant display, titled \"Blood Swept Lands and Seas of Red,\" captivated millions as it commemorated the centenary of World War I. Spanning from July to November 2014, the installation featured 888,246 ceramic poppies, each representing a British military fatality during the war.\n\nDespite the overwhelming praise and admiration from the public, Cummins revealed that he faced a disturbing backlash, including threats to his life. Speaking candidly, he expressed shock and dismay at the vitriol directed towards him. \"I never imagined that creating a tribute to those who sacrificed their lives would provoke such hostility,\" Cummins stated in an interview.\n\nThe artist, who worked tirelessly alongside a dedicated team to bring the vision to life, noted that the threats came as a stark contrast to the project's intention. The installation was conceived as a powerful reminder of the human cost of war, resonating deeply with visitors who flocked to the Tower of London to witness the sea of red. Many found it a moving and reflective experience, drawing attention to the impact of conflict and the importance of remembrance.\n\nDespite the unsettling threats, Cummins remains steadfast in his commitment to creating art that sparks conversation and evokes emotion. He acknowledged the profound impact the poppy installation had on public consciousness, while also highlighting the challenges faced by artists in navigating public opinion. \"Art has the power to unite, but it can also divide,\" he reflected.\n\nThe exhibition's legacy continues to influence commemorative events and discussions around the world. As Cummins moves forward, he remains dedicated to his craft, undeterred by the adversity he faced. The artist hopes his work will continue to inspire and remind future generations of the sacrifices made during wartime."

    "HWT": "The men were watching a World Cup game in June 1994 when gunmen burst into the Heights Bar in Loughinisland, County Down, and opened fire. Five others were wounded in the attack carried out by the loyalist paramilitary Ulster Volunteer Force. No-one has ever been convicted of the attack. Families of the victims have persistently accused the police of failing to properly investigate the killings, claiming they wanted to protect informers. They have alleged there was collusion between some police officers and those who carried out the attack. The men who died were Adrian Rogan 34, Malcolm Jenkinson, 53, Barney Greene, 87, Daniel McCreanor 59, Patrick O'Hare, 35, and Eamon Byrne, 39. Mr Greene was one of the oldest people to be killed in the Northern Ireland Troubles. Five years ago the previous police ombudsman, Al Hutchinson, published a report which said the police had not properly investigated the killings. But his report said there was insufficient evidence of collusion between the police and the Ulster Volunteer Force. The families took legal action and in December 2012 the report's findings were quashed. Mr Hutchinson resigned shortly afterwards and his successor, Dr Michael Maguire, re-opened the investigation. The families and their lawyers were briefed about the findings in Loughinisland on Wednesday. Dr Maguire's report will contain thousands of words, but for the families of those killed and seriously injured in the Heights Bar, the focus will be on whether he uses just one word - collusion. South Down MP, the SDLP's Margaret Ritchie, told BBC Radio Ulster's Good Morning Ulster programme: \"We want to see Dr Maguire call it for what it is. It is collusion. \"\"But we also want him to say quite clearly, who did it, how many were involved in it, was there local involvement in this heinous crime?\"",
    "MGT": "In a significant development, the police ombudsman is set to deliver a ruling on long-standing allegations of collusion between police forces and a loyalist gang responsible for the killing of six Catholic men 22 years ago. The case, which has been shrouded in controversy and demands for accountability, revolves around the 1994 attack at a bar in Northern Ireland, where the victims were targeted due to their religious affiliations.\n\nThe incident, which occurred during the height of the Troubles, shook the community and heightened tensions between Catholic and Protestant factions. Families of the victims and advocacy groups have persistently called for a thorough investigation into the possible complicity of law enforcement in the attack. Their demands have been fueled by suspicions that police may have turned a blind eye to the activities of the gang or, worse, actively facilitated their violent actions.\n\nThe ombudsman's forthcoming decision is expected to shed light on whether police forces were indeed complicit in the attack, and if so, the nature and extent of their involvement. This ruling comes after years of investigation and will be closely watched by the families of the victims, community leaders, and human rights organizations. \n\nThe potential implications of the ombudsman’s findings are vast, with the possibility of renewed calls for justice and accountability. It could also pave the way for a broader examination of historical collusion between law enforcement and paramilitary groups during the Troubles. The ruling is anticipated to be a pivotal moment in Northern Ireland's ongoing efforts to confront its past and foster reconciliation among its divided communities. As the region waits with bated breath, the ombudsman's decision could mark a crucial step toward healing and justice for the families affected by the tragic events of 22 years ago."

    "HWT": "Sunday marks a decade since the law came in and 19% of adults in Wales now smoke compared to 24% before the ban. There are also 6% fewer teenage boys and 14% fewer teenage girls smoking. Campaign charity Ash Wales said there had been a \"major cultural shift\" but smokers' group Forest said the ban had hit pubs and clubs. The only group that saw an increase in smokers was the unemployed, where the level has risen from 41% to 43% in the last 10 years. Ash Cymru said other measures had contributed to the fall in smoking, such as the ban on sales from vending machines, uniform packaging, and the rise in the age limit to buy tobacco from 16 to 18. Chief executive Suzanne Cass said: \"The smoking ban has resulted in the most positive improvement in the nation's health in decades. \"The significance of this legislation should not be underestimated. \"Thousands more children now live in a smoke-free home, and hundreds of thousands of people are no longer subjected to the deadly effects of passive smoking.\" Ms Cass also said she supported the increased use of e-cigarettes, with 141,000 users in Wales, saying they are \"95% less harmful than traditional cigarettes\". The charity's research showed 81% of people in Wales supported the ban - including three quarters of smokers themselves. However, in its own survey of 1,000 people, pro-smoking group Forest found 58% of people think pubs and private members' clubs should be allowed to provide well-ventilated smoking rooms, with 37% opposed. Forest director Simon Clark said: \"The suggestion that the smoking ban is hugely popular has been exposed as a myth. \"The smoking ban hit pubs and working men's clubs really badly.\" He called on the Welsh Government to commission an independent review on the full impact of the ban including public health, the hospitality industry and local communities. It will comment on the figures on Monday.",
    "MGT": "In a remarkable public health achievement, Wales has seen a significant reduction in the number of smokers over the past decade. According to data released by the Welsh Government, there are now 94,000 fewer smokers in the country compared to ten years ago. This decline coincides with the implementation of a ban on smoking in enclosed public spaces, a measure designed to protect non-smokers from the harmful effects of secondhand smoke and encourage smokers to quit.\n\nThe smoking ban, which came into effect in April 2007, prohibits smoking in places such as offices, restaurants, and public transportation, creating a healthier environment for residents and visitors alike. The success of this legislation is evident in the substantial decrease in smoking rates, suggesting that the ban has played a crucial role in changing attitudes towards smoking and promoting healthier lifestyles.\n\nHealth officials in Wales have hailed the decline as a testament to the effectiveness of the ban and other tobacco control measures. These include public health campaigns, support for smoking cessation programs, and increased awareness of the dangers of smoking. The reduction in smoking prevalence is expected to lead to significant improvements in public health, with fewer cases of smoking-related illnesses such as lung cancer, heart disease, and respiratory conditions.\n\nWelsh Health Minister Vaughan Gething commented on the positive impact of the smoking ban, noting that the policy has not only improved air quality in public spaces but also encouraged many individuals to quit smoking altogether. He emphasized the importance of continuing to support efforts aimed at reducing smoking rates and improving public health.\n\nAs Wales celebrates this milestone, the government remains committed to further reducing smoking prevalence and ensuring a healthier future for all its citizens. The success of the smoking ban serves as a powerful example for other regions considering similar measures to combat smoking-related health issues."

    "prompt": "A new method of delivering data, which uses the visible spectrum rather than radio waves, has been tested in a working office.",
    "HWT": "Li-fi can deliver internet access 100 times faster than traditional wi-fi, offering speeds of up to 1Gbps (gigabit per second). It requires a light source, such as a standard LED bulb, an internet connection and a photo detector. It was tested this week by Estonian start-up Velmenni, in Tallinn. Velmenni used a li-fi-enabled light bulb to transmit data at speeds of 1Gbps. Laboratory tests have shown theoretical speeds of up to 224Gbps. It was tested in an office, to allow workers to access the internet and in an industrial space, where it provided a smart lighting solution. Speaking to the International Business Times, chief executive Deepak Solanki said that the technology could reach consumers \"within three to four years\". The term li-fi was first coined by Prof Harald Haas from Edinburgh University, who demonstrated the technology at a Ted (Technology, Entertainment and Design) conference in 2011. His talk, which has now been watched nearly two million times, showed an LED lamp streaming video. Prof Haas described a future when billions of light bulbs could become wireless hotspots. One of the big advantages of li-fi is the fact that, unlike wi-fi,  it does not interfere with other radio signals, so could be utilised on aircraft and in other places where interference is an issue. While the spectrum for radio waves is in short supply, the visible light spectrum is 10,000 times larger, meaning it is unlikely to run out any time soon. But the technology also has its drawbacks - most notably the fact that it cannot be deployed outdoors in direct sunlight, because that would interfere with its signal. Neither can the technology travel through walls so initial use is likely to be limited to places where it can be used to supplement wi-fi networks, such as in congested urban areas or places where wi-fi is not safe, such as hospitals.",
    "MGT": "In a groundbreaking advancement that could revolutionize the way we transmit information, researchers have successfully tested a novel method of data delivery utilizing the visible spectrum of light, rather than traditional radio waves, in a working office environment. This promising technology, often referred to as Li-Fi (light fidelity), offers a glimpse into the future of high-speed wireless communication, boasting several advantages over conventional Wi-Fi and other radio wave-based systems.\n\nThe test was conducted in a modern office setting, where researchers installed specialized LED bulbs capable of modulating light at extremely high speeds. These bulbs emit light that carries data to receivers equipped on computers and other digital devices, enabling rapid and secure data transmission without the interference often experienced with radio waves. The test demonstrated not only the feasibility of this innovative technology but also its potential to transform our digital landscape by offering faster, more reliable connections.\n\nOne of the key benefits of Li-Fi is its capacity to operate in environments where radio waves are either undesirable or impractical, such as hospitals, airplanes, or industrial settings with sensitive equipment. Unlike radio waves, which can penetrate walls and result in security vulnerabilities, light-based data transmission is confined to the illuminated area, reducing the risk of unauthorized access. Furthermore, the visible spectrum is vast and largely untapped for data communication, providing a virtually limitless bandwidth that could alleviate congestion experienced with current wireless networks.\n\nThe successful implementation of Li-Fi in a real-world office environment marks a significant milestone in the journey toward mainstream adoption. As the demand for faster and more secure data transmission continues to grow, industries worldwide are increasingly looking to innovative solutions like Li-Fi to meet their needs. Researchers anticipate that further refinement and commercialization of this technology could lead to widespread application across various sectors, including smart cities, autonomous vehicles, and the Internet of Things (IoT).\n\nWhile challenges remain, such as the need for line-of-sight between the transmitter and receiver and potential disruptions from physical obstructions, the advantages of Li-Fi are hard to ignore. As development continues, experts are optimistic that these hurdles can be overcome, paving the way for an era where light, rather than radio waves, illuminates our digital communication pathways. With this successful test, the future of data transmission shines brightly, offering a glimpse into a world where connectivity is faster, safer, and more efficient than ever before."

    "prompt": "The latest weather data suggest that the Earth's average temperature is close to breaking the record set in 2010.",
    "HWT": "Even more striking is the fact that if this occurs, then fourteen out of fifteen of the warmest years on record will have occurred since the turn of the century. However, while record-breaking warmth is consistent with the general trend of global warming, it's not always the case that each year is warmer than the previous one. There are temporary ups and downs that ride on top of the overall warming trend. It's quite possible for a few years to elapse before the next record year, and the warming can speed up or slow down for runs of years, as happened for example in the slowdown of warming since the end of the last century. So what makes one year warmer or colder than its predecessor? The answer to this depends on a number of factors. Large volcanic eruptions can cause a temporary dip in temperatures for a few years due to reflection of sunlight by the resulting atmospheric particles. This happened following the eruption of Mt Pinatubo in 1991, for example. Fluctuations in the ocean can also cause temporary ups and downs, and the massive heat release during an El Nino event in the tropics can temporarily raise global temperatures, such as occurred in 1998. This year, the tropical ocean has indeed warmed up in both the Pacific and the Atlantic but both of these ocean basins have also been very warm in northern latitudes, compounding the effect on global temperature. While the oceans exhibit record warmth, it is the average temperature over land regions and in the Arctic that has risen most. It is worth noting that this is consistent with predictions from computer models of climate change, which have suggested for many years that warming over land, and over the Arctic, will outstrip the increase in global average temperature as climate change progresses. The WMO report highlights a number of record-breaking weather events around the world:",
    "MGT": "In a striking indication of the ongoing shifts in global climate patterns, recent weather data reveals that the Earth's average temperature is inching closer to surpassing the record set in 2010. Scientists and meteorologists around the world are closely monitoring the situation, as this could mark a significant milestone in the narrative of climate change.\n\nThe data, collected from various global weather stations and satellite observations, highlights an alarming trend of rising temperatures that have been escalating over the past decade. The potential record-breaking temperatures are not just isolated occurrences but rather part of a broader pattern of warming, which has been attributed to a combination of natural climate variability and human-induced factors like greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nThe year 2010 has long stood as a benchmark for high global temperatures, influenced by a strong El Niño event that year. El Niño, a climate phenomenon characterized by the warming of ocean surface temperatures in the Pacific, typically contributes to elevated global temperatures. However, the current warming trend seems to be surpassing the influence of any singular climate event, suggesting a more permanent alteration in Earth's climatic systems.\n\nExperts are expressing concern about the implications of such warming trends. Increased average temperatures can lead to more frequent and severe weather events, including heatwaves, droughts, and powerful storms, all of which pose significant risks to ecosystems, agriculture, and human populations. The potential record-breaking temperatures underscore the urgency for global efforts to mitigate climate change impacts.\n\nGovernments and international organizations have been urged to accelerate their commitments to reducing carbon emissions and transitioning to renewable energy sources. The data serves as a compelling reminder of the need for global cooperation in addressing climate change, with scientists advocating for immediate action to prevent further temperature increases.\n\nAs the year progresses, the scientific community will continue to monitor temperature trends closely. Whether or not 2023 will officially become the hottest year on record remains to be seen, but the message is clear: the planet is warming at an unprecedented rate, and the need for decisive action has never been more critical."

    "prompt": "Defending champion Serena Williams sealed a place in the French Open last 16, beating home favourite Kristina Mladenovic after a lengthy rain delay.",
    "HWT": "Top seed Williams won the first set 6-4 and was a tie-break away from defeating the 26th seed when they came off. After a two-and-a-half hour delay, Williams converted a fifth match point to win 6-4 7-6 (12-10) in Paris. The American, 34, aiming for her 22nd Grand Slam title, was joined in the next round by older sister Venus. Venus's match against France's Alize Cornet was stopped at 2-1 because of the rain but the 35-year-old came back to seal a hard-fought 7-6 1-6 6-0 win. Serena had dropped just five games in her first two matches at Roland Garros, but faced a tougher test against the French number one. Each player held their serve in the opening set until Williams edged ahead in the 10th game by taking her third break point. Neither could gain an advantage in the second set, with Mladenovic thumping down an ace in the rain to set up a tie-breaker. When the match finally resumed on Court Philippe Chatrier, Mladenovic led 5-3 in the decider - and spurned a set point at 9-8 - before two wayward forehands saw Williams through. \"It was very difficult, she played really, really well,\" Serena said. \"She forced me to bring out my best tennis.\" She will play in the fourth round against Ukraine's 18th seed Elina Svitolina, who won 6-4 6-4 against 2008 champion Ana Ivanovic. British number two Aljaz Bedene and top seed Novak Djokovic were set to play later on Chatrier. Subscribe to the BBC Sport newsletter to get our pick of news, features and video sent to your inbox.",
    "MGT": "In a thrilling display of resilience and skill, defending champion Serena Williams secured her spot in the last 16 of the French Open, overcoming local favorite Kristina Mladenovic in a match that was as much a battle against the elements as it was against her opponent. The encounter, held at the storied Roland Garros, was marked by a lengthy rain delay that tested the patience and focus of both players.\n\nThe match began under overcast skies, with the crowd at Philippe-Chatrier Court largely in favor of the Frenchwoman, Mladenovic, who had been riding a wave of support from her home audience throughout the tournament. Williams, however, was unfazed by the partisan atmosphere, bringing her characteristic intensity and precision to the clay court.\n\nIn the opening set, Mladenovic showcased her powerful groundstrokes and strategic play, managing to keep pace with Williams and thrilling her supporters with every point won. The set was closely contested, with both players exchanging fierce rallies and demonstrating impressive court coverage. However, it was Williams who edged out Mladenovic in the crucial moments, taking the first set with a score of 7-5.\n\nJust as the second set was getting underway, the skies opened up, and rain began to fall, forcing a suspension of play. The players retreated to the locker rooms, and the fans took cover, as the rain delay stretched on for several hours. This interruption could have disrupted the momentum of either player, but Williams, known for her mental toughness, used the break to regroup and refocus.\n\nWhen play resumed, Williams returned to the court with renewed determination. She quickly established control, breaking Mladenovic's serve early in the second set and maintaining her lead with powerful serves and precise baseline play. Despite Mladenovic's efforts to mount a comeback, Williams proved too strong, ultimately winning the second set 6-3 and sealing her victory.\n\nWith this win, Serena Williams advances to the round of 16, continuing her quest for another Grand Slam title. Her performance against Mladenovic not only highlighted her exceptional talent and experience but also reaffirmed her status as a formidable competitor, regardless of the challenges faced, both on and off the court."

The unexpected withdrawal occurred during her opening match against Canadian opponent Bianca Andreescu.\n\nWatson, who has shown promising form in the past months, began the match with vigor, displaying her usual tenacity and skill on the hard court. However, as the game progressed, it became evident that she was struggling with mobility, and her powerful serves were notably absent. Despite her best efforts to push through the discomfort, the pain proved too significant, leading to her decision to retire from the match.\n\nThe 31-year-old Watson, known for her resilience and competitive spirit, expressed her disappointment post-match. \"It's always tough to withdraw from a tournament, especially one as prestigious as the Rogers Cup. I was looking forward to competing here and testing myself against some of the best players in the world,\" Watson commented. \"I'll be focusing on recovery and hope to return stronger soon.\"\n\nWatson's departure is a setback in her quest to climb the WTA rankings, but her determination to return to form remains unwavering.

Fans and fellow players have extended their support and well-wishes, hoping to see Watson back on the court in top condition soon. Meanwhile, Andreescu advances to the next round, benefiting from Watson's unfortunate exit."

    "prompt": "Ryan Christie says Derek McInnes' decision to stay at Aberdeen convinced him to agree another loan deal at Pittodrie.",
    "HWT": "The Celtic midfielder spent the second half of last season on loan at the Dons, scoring seven goals in 15 games. But he admits to being unsure about a return until manager McInnes turned down the chance to join English Championship club Sunderland. \"As soon as I heard that, my mind was made up to come back,\" Christie said. The 22-year-old was invited back to Aberdeen as part of the deal that took Jonny Hayes to Celtic for £1.3m. Sunderland's move for McInnes, to replace David Moyes, caused Christie a few moments of concern as he enjoyed his summer holiday. McInnes decided against a switch to Wearside to stay with the club he guided to second place in the Scottish Premiership and runners-up in both domestic cup competitions last term. That delighted Christie on a personal level and he also believes it was a significant moment for the whole of Scottish football. \"It came out in the press that I would be coming back, but I was still on holiday lying on a beach,\" Christie told Red TV. \"I hadn't had a phone call, so I didn't know what was going on. \"When I came back, things had got into motion, but understandably I didn't want to make a decision until I knew the gaffer was staying. \"When the news broke that he was going to stay, it was a shock to a lot of people in Scottish football, but it's brilliant news. \"Not just for the club, as it is a huge lift, but also for the whole of Scottish football. \"For a few years there it turned out to be that as soon as there was any offer from England, people would jump ship. So it's credit to the manager that he has stayed here. \"He called me the next day to say he had made his mind up to stay at Aberdeen and wanted to have me on board.\"",
    "MGT": "In a significant boost for Aberdeen FC, midfielder Ryan Christie has agreed to extend his loan deal at Pittodrie, citing manager Derek McInnes' decision to remain with the club as a pivotal factor in his commitment. Christie, who has been instrumental in Aberdeen's recent successes, expressed his admiration for McInnes, emphasizing the manager’s influence on both his personal development and the team’s performance.\n\nChristie, originally from Celtic, has been with Aberdeen since early last season. During his time with the club, he has become a fan favorite, known for his agility, creativity, and goal-scoring ability. His decision to prolong his stay is seen as a testament to the positive environment fostered by McInnes.\n\nSpeaking to reporters, Christie commented, \"Derek staying was massive for me. His vision for the team aligns with my own aspirations, and I feel I can continue to grow under his guidance. The support from the fans and the camaraderie within the squad also made my decision easier.\"\n\nMcInnes, who has been at the helm of Aberdeen since 2013, has been linked with several high-profile managerial positions due to his impressive track record. However, his choice to remain has brought stability and optimism to the club. Under his leadership, Aberdeen has consistently challenged for top honors in the Scottish Premiership and made notable appearances in European competitions.\n\nChristie’s extended loan deal is expected to bolster Aberdeen's aspirations for the upcoming season, as they aim to build on their recent achievements and challenge the dominance of the league's traditional powerhouses."

    "prompt": "Growth in UK house prices slowed in the year to July, the country's largest mortgage lender has said, although they are still rising \"robustly\".",
    "HWT": "The Halifax said that prices rose at an annual pace of 7.9% last month - down from 9.6% in June. During July itself, prices actually fell, by 0.6%, the largest monthly drop since April 2014. It brings the average price of a flat or house across the country back down to Â£198,883. The sharp fall in July was described as \"a correction\" by Howard Archer, chief UK economist with IHS Global Insight, following a 1.6% rise in prices in June. The Halifax figures are in contrast to those from rival lender Nationwide, which said earlier this week that the rate of house price growth picked up to 3.5% in July, from 3.3% a month earlier. However, the Halifax said it expected strong growth in prices for the rest of the year. \"The underlying pace of house price growth remains robust notwithstanding the easing in July,\" said Stephen Noakes, Halifax's managing director of retail customer products. \"Continuing economic recovery, earnings growth in excess of consumer price inflation, and very low mortgage rates all underpin housing demand.\" Mr Archer said the contrasting figures from the Halifax and Nationwide served as a warning against reading too much into any one survey. \"This highlights the need to not pin too much weight on one particular house price survey or measure, but to try and take an overall view from the data,\" he said. Nationwide and Halifax both base their data on mortgage approvals, but they use a different \"mix-adjustment\" in their methodology. That involves a different weighting of the figures, to reflect different types of property being sold in any month, and more sales in a particular region of the UK.",
    "MGT": "In the year leading up to July, the UK's housing market experienced a slowdown in growth, according to the latest report from the nation's largest mortgage lender. Despite the deceleration, house prices have continued to rise at a robust pace, reflecting ongoing demand and market dynamics.\n\nThis trend underscores a significant shift in the housing market, which has been characterized by strong price increases over the last few years. The slower growth rate, however, suggests that some of the heat may be dissipating from the market, potentially offering a reprieve for prospective homebuyers who have been grappling with soaring prices.\n\nThe mortgage lender's report indicates that while the rate of increase has tempered, the underlying demand for housing remains resilient. Factors such as limited housing stock, low interest rates, and the enduring appeal of property investment continue to underpin the market's strength. These elements are sustaining price growth even as broader economic uncertainties and inflationary pressures weigh on consumer confidence.\n\nIndustry experts have been keenly observing these developments, noting that while the slowdown might signal the beginning of a more balanced market, it is not indicative of an imminent downturn. The sustained price increases, albeit at a slower pace, are seen as evidence of the market's underlying health, with many viewing it as a natural adjustment following an unprecedented period of rapid price escalation.\n\nMoreover, regional disparities in price growth are becoming increasingly pronounced. Areas outside of London and the South East, traditionally slower in price increases, are witnessing more significant rises, driven by a shift in buyer preferences post-pandemic. This diversification in demand is contributing to the overall robustness of the market across the country.\n\nAs policymakers and industry stakeholders continue to assess the implications of these trends, the focus remains on ensuring a sustainable housing market that balances affordability with investment opportunities. While challenges persist, the current landscape presents opportunities for innovation in housing solutions and policy frameworks designed to support both buyers and investors.\n\nIn conclusion, while the growth in UK house prices may be slowing, the market remains robust, driven by persistent demand and strategic shifts in buyer behavior. As the year progresses, the housing market's trajectory will be closely monitored, offering insights into the broader economic landscape."

    "HWT": "The head of police, Alberto Jorge Aracena, said many of the bodies had been badly burnt. He said fighting broke out early on Friday between inmates at the maximum security area of the Palmasola jail in the city of Santa Cruz. \"There was a fight for control in two cellblocks in the prison,\" said Mr Aracena. He said prisoners in one of the blocks had blown up a metal propane tank in another block around dawn. Local media reported that shots had been heard after the explosion. A fire that broke out shortly afterwards took almost two hours to put out. Mr Aracena said the authorities had brought the situation under control. Another government official, Celso Parada, said the gas explosion had caused many injuries. \"I saw some 60 injured inmates. Some of them were badly burnt,\" he said. Mr Parada said the death toll could eventually be much higher. He also said he had seen the charred body of a small boy. Prisons in Bolivia are often overcrowded, but not only with adults. Hundreds of children live in them while their parents serve their sentences. Under the country's legislation, children under six years are allowed to stay in their parents' cells. But many remain there even longer, as there is nowhere else for them to go. President Evo Morales expressed \"dismay\" over the deaths, ordering an urgent investigation.",

Initial reports suggest that the melee was sparked by clashes between rival groups within the prison. However, the exact cause of the conflict remains under investigation by local officials.\n\nWitnesses described scenes of chaos and terror as the disturbance unfolded. The sound of shouts and clashes echoed through the facility, creating a harrowing atmosphere that overwhelmed the prison staff. Despite efforts to restore order, the violence quickly spiraled out of control.\n\nBolivia's Ministry of Justice and Police have launched a thorough investigation into the incident to determine the factors that contributed to the escalation of violence. Authorities are also focusing on improving security measures within the prison to prevent future occurrences of such tragedies.\n\nThe Bolivian government has expressed its condolences to the families of the victims, assuring them that the investigation will be thorough and that steps will be taken to ensure justice is served. Additionally, medical teams have been dispatched to provide urgent care to the injured inmates, with several requiring hospitalization due to the severity of their injuries.\n\nPalmasola prison, known for its overcrowding and challenging conditions, has faced criticism in the past for its management and security issues. This latest incident highlights the urgent need for reforms within the country's penitentiary system to improve conditions and prevent violence.\n\nAs Bolivia grapples with the aftermath of this tragic event, the focus remains on understanding the root causes of the riot and implementing measures to safeguard the lives and well-being of those incarcerated."

About 10,000 people were quizzed following Olof Palme's murder in 1986; 134 people claimed to have shot him dead as he left a cinema with his wife. The charismatic Social Democratic leader was left dying in a pool of blood on the pavement. Mr Petersson faces a Herculean task: the Palme files take up 250m (820ft) of shelving.

    "MGT": "In a surprising turn of events, Swedish authorities have announced the re-opening of the investigation into the assassination of Prime Minister Olof Palme, a case that has remained unsolved for over three decades. Olof Palme, who served as Sweden's prime minister from 1969 to 1976 and again from 1982 until his untimely death in 1986, was a prominent figure known for his outspoken views and international presence. His assassination shocked the nation and left many questions unanswered, leading to one of the most enduring mysteries in Swedish history.\n\nThe decision to re-open the case comes amid renewed interest and potential new leads, according to officials. Palme was shot dead on February 28, 1986, while walking home with his wife from a cinema in central Stockholm. Despite an extensive investigation, the perpetrator was never found, and the case was officially declared unsolved in 1987, although it remained open informally for years.\n\nProsecutor Krister Petersson, assigned to lead the investigation, has expressed optimism about uncovering new information that could finally bring closure to the case. \"We believe there is potential for new evidence that could shed light on what truly transpired that night,\" Petersson stated in a press conference, hinting at previously unexplored leads and possible advancements in forensic technology that could aid the investigation.\n\nThe assassination of Olof Palme has sparked numerous theories over the years, ranging from international conspiracies to politically motivated crimes. The complexity of the case is further compounded by Palme's controversial political stances, including his criticism of authoritarian regimes and advocacy for social justice, which earned him both admirers and adversaries globally.\n\nAs the investigation reopens, there is a fresh wave of optimism among both officials and the public, with hopes that modern investigative techniques might finally solve the mystery that has eluded justice for so long. The Swedish government remains committed to uncovering the truth, with the assurance that no stone will be left unturned.\n\nThe re-investigation not only seeks to resolve a historical enigma but also aims to provide closure to Palme's family and the Swedish populace, who have long awaited answers regarding the tragic loss of one of their most influential leaders."

    "HWT": "Verena Becker was an accessory to the 1977 murder of West Germany's chief federal prosecutor, Siegfried Buback, the court ruled. His driver and a bodyguard also died in the ambush. Becker, 59, denied any involvement. Two-and-a-half years already served in jail will be cut from her sentence. The killer has not yet been uncovered. The ambush happened in the south-western city of Karlsruhe. At the time the RAF was waging a violent campaign against the West German state, targeting prominent establishment figures and US military bases. Mr Buback and his two aides were shot dead by a passenger on a motorcycle as their car was waiting at traffic lights. Becker went on trial in Stuttgart in 2010, accused of playing a crucial role in planning and carrying out the murder. She was arrested the month after the murders. The RAF, also called the Baader-Meinhof gang, killed more than 30 people. The group broke up more than 10 years ago.",
    "MGT": "In a significant development in Germany's legal landscape, a former member of the notorious far-left Red Army Faction (RAF) has been sentenced to four years in prison for her involvement in the murder of a prominent prosecutor. The verdict, delivered by a German court, has rekindled memories of the RAF's violent campaigns that shook the nation in the late 20th century.\n\nThe convicted individual, whose identity remains protected under German privacy laws, was charged with complicity in the 1977 assassination of federal prosecutor Siegfried Buback. Buback was a high-profile target due to his role in prosecuting members of the RAF, a group that emerged in the 1970s and was responsible for a series of attacks, including bombings and assassinations, aimed at dismantling the capitalist system they opposed.\n\nThe trial has been closely watched, not only due to the historical significance of the RAF's actions but also because it raises questions about justice and accountability decades after the crimes were committed. During the proceedings, the court heard testimonies and examined evidence that linked the former militant to the planning and execution of the assassination. While the defendant admitted to being part of the RAF, she denied direct involvement in Buback's murder. Nonetheless, the court found her culpable for the crime, citing her role in the broader conspiracy that led to the assassination.\n\nThe RAF, also known as the Baader-Meinhof Group, was founded in the late 1960s and became infamous for its radical leftist ideology. Its members, driven by Marxist-Leninist beliefs, viewed themselves as revolutionaries fighting against what they perceived as oppressive state mechanisms. The group waged a campaign of terror across Germany, targeting figures of authority, financial institutions, and symbols of capitalist power.\n\nThe sentencing has sparked discussions in Germany about the legacy of the RAF and the country's process of dealing with its tumultuous past. While some view the court's decision as a necessary step towards achieving justice for victims and their families, others argue that the focus should now shift towards reconciliation and understanding.\n\nAs Germany continues to grapple with the shadow of its history, the case serves as a reminder of the enduring impact of political violence and the challenges of addressing crimes from a bygone era. The court's verdict underscores the importance of upholding the rule of law, even as society seeks healing and closure from its past conflicts."

The district magistrate of Meerut city, Pankaj Yadav, confirmed to BBC Hindi that after investigating the complaint they found no evidence to support the sedition charge. But he said officials would continue to investigate allegations of other offences, including disrupting communal harmony and causing damage to public property. The sedition charge carries a three-year prison term in India. Earlier, Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Omar Abdullah promised to speak to the chief minister of Uttar Pradesh and intervene on the students' behalf, describing the charge as \"unacceptably harsh\" The incident happened at the Swami Vivekanand Subharti University in Meerut city on Sunday where a group of students  allegedly \"celebrated Pakistan's win\", leading to arguments with other college mates, reports say.

The initial charges had drawn widespread criticism from various quarters, including human rights organizations and political leaders, who argued that the accusations were an overreaction and an infringement on freedom of expression.\n\nThis incident had highlighted the sensitive nature of India-Pakistan relations, particularly in the realm of sports, where emotions often run high.

The association marked the anniversary of the Croke Park stadium attack before Saturday's International Rules test between Ireland and Australia. The names of the victims were read out before the match, and 14 flames were lit in their memory. The dead included 24-year-old GAA player Michael Hogan, after whom Croke Park's Hogan Stand is named. Senior GAA staff laid a laurel wreath at the spot where he was shot. The event is often referred to as the original Bloody Sunday, to distinguish it from the 1972 killings of 14 civilians by British troops in Londonderry during the Troubles. The Croke Park attack has been a scar on Anglo-Irish relations for decades, but a visit by Britain's Queen Elizabeth to the stadium in 2011 was widely acknowledged as a powerful gesture of reconciliation. Speaking ahead of Saturday's ceremony, GAA director general, PÃ¡raic Duffy, said: \"The tragic loss of 14 lives on that fateful day, when almost 15,000 turned up to enjoy a football game between Dublin and Tipperary, was a harrowing moment for the association. \"While we have thankfully left those dark days behind us, it is only fitting that we honour the memory of those who were killed.\"",

Mourinho says a busy fixture schedule made it necessary to prioritise. \"Seventeen matches in seven weeks is impossible. It's not a gamble, just a consequence of our situation,\" he said. \"It was a simple decision, based on common sense.\" The Europa League champions are guaranteed Champions League football for next season, as are the top four finishers in the Premier League. The Red Devils are currently fifth in the league, four points behind fourth-placed Manchester City with three games remaining. Mourinho made eight changes as United's 25-match unbeaten run in the league was ended by Arsenal on Sunday. The Portuguese coach is confident the Europa League remains United's best chance of securing Champions League football and insists he will have \"no regrets\" if his side ultimately fail to win the competition. \"Let's see if we can do it,\" he added. \"It doesn't matter what happens.

    "HWT": "His daughter, Ursula, confirmed the singer's death to The Washington Post. He died in a New York hospital earlier this week from complications following a stroke. Covay gave Aretha Franklin one of her biggest hits with Chain of Fools in 1968, a song he had written 15 years earlier. His singing style also influenced Mick Jagger, as seen in the Rolling Stones cover of his song Mercy Mercy. Covay started out in music in a gospel group with his siblings at school, before joining doo-wop group Rainbows. While trying to make it as a solo artist and singer-songwriter he spent time as Little Richard's chauffeur and warm-up act. His first chart hit came in 1961 with Pony Time. The track, however, became an even bigger hit when Chubby Checker recorded his own version a year later in 1962, topping the pop and R&B charts. This pattern continued with his song Mercy Mercy, which he recorded in 1964 with a then-unknown Jimi Hendrix on guitar, which went into the top 40. A year later the Rolling Stones recorded their own version for their album Out of Our Heads, causing many to point out the similarity in singing styles between Jagger and Covay. While working as a songwriter at the Brill Building in New York, Covay wrote for artists including Gladys Knight and the Pips, Wilson Pickett and Solomon Burke. He was also part of the short-lived group the Soul Clan which featured Burke, Joe Tex, Ben E King and Arthur Conley. His work has been covered by a wide variety of artists including Gene Vincent, Connie Francis, Steppenwolf, Bobby Womack and the Small Faces. Covay suffered a stroke in 1992 and a year later stars including Ronnie Wood, Iggy Pop and Todd Rundgren produced a tribute album entitled Back to the Streets: Celebrating the Music of Don Covay.

    "HWT": "David Craig Ellis, 41, has admitted killing Alec Warburton, 59, at a house in Sketty, Swansea, but denies murder. Swansea Crown Court has heard that unemployed Mr Ellis could not afford his rent and Mr Warburton suggested \"things of a sexual nature\" instead. Mr Ellis told the jury his experience of being sexually abused as a child had triggered the fatal attack. Mr Ellis said his landlord had \"barged\" into his bedroom and reminded him his rent was in arrears. Mr Ellis said he felt angry due to the suggestion he could give sexual favours in lieu of rent and he tried to punch Mr Warburton after he cupped his face. \"I was abused as a child. The height difference made me feel like a child again,\" said Mr Ellis. He said he picked up a screwdriver and tried to stab Mr Warburton but the attempt was unsuccessful. The jury was told Mr Ellis eventually managed to kick his landlord in the groin causing him to drop to one knee. Christopher Clee QC, prosecuting, said: \"At that stage he was of no threat to you at all, was he?\" Mr Ellis replied: \"I don't know what I was thinking at the time.\" The court then heard how Mr Ellis picked up a hammer and struck Mr Warburton on the back of the head. Mr Clee asked Mr Ellis: \"You hit him from behind with such force you made a hole in his skull, didn't you?\" He replied: \"Yes.\" Mr Clee added: \"You caved that man's head skull in - what were you doing?\" Mr Ellis said: \" I don't know, I lost control.\" The trial continues.",
    "MGT": "In a courtroom filled with palpable tension, the trial of a man accused of murdering his landlord unfolded with unexpected revelations. The defendant, John Smith, took the stand to explain the circumstances that led to the tragic incident, asserting that he \"lost control\" following an unsettling request from the landlord. The case, which has gripped the local community, revolves around the events leading up to the death of Martin Jones, a 52-year-old property owner.\n\nAccording to Smith’s testimony, the altercation occurred after Jones allegedly propositioned him for sexual favours in exchange for reduced rent. Smith described feeling shocked and violated by the request, which he claims triggered a sudden and uncontrollable emotional response. \"I felt trapped and humiliated,\" Smith recounted, his voice trembling as he relived the moment. \"It was as if everything just snapped inside me.\"\n\nThe prosecution presented evidence painting Smith as a volatile individual, pointing to a history of conflicts with the landlord over rent and maintenance issues. They argued that the murder was premeditated, suggesting that Smith had harboured resentment towards Jones for some time. However, the defence countered these claims, emphasizing Smith’s lack of prior criminal history and framing the incident as a tragic consequence of extreme provocation.\n\nWitnesses testified to hearing loud arguments emanating from Jones’s apartment on the night of the murder. Neighbors described Smith as generally quiet and reserved, expressing disbelief at the violent turn of events. \"I’ve never seen him act out,\" said one neighbor. \"It’s hard to imagine him doing something like this.\"\n\nPsychological experts were brought in to assess Smith’s mental state, with some suggesting that the alleged proposition could have triggered a temporary state of diminished capacity. The defence argued that this emotional turmoil, combined with Smith’s financial struggles, contributed significantly to his actions.\n\nAs the trial continues, the jury must weigh the complexities of human emotion against the gravity of the crime. The case raises profound questions about the limits of self-control and the unpredictable nature of human behavior when faced with deeply distressing situations."

    "MGT": "Whistl, a prominent player in the UK postal industry, has announced its decision to terminate its home delivery service in three major cities: London, Liverpool, and Manchester. This move places approximately 1,800 jobs in jeopardy, marking a significant shift in the company's operational strategy.\n\nThe decision comes amidst a challenging landscape for the postal sector, which has been grappling with evolving market dynamics and increasing competition. Whistl's home delivery service, which has been operational since its inception, had aimed to provide a viable alternative to the national postal service, focusing on efficiency and customer satisfaction. However, the company has found it increasingly difficult to maintain profitability in the face of rising costs and logistical challenges.\n\nNick Wells, CEO of Whistl, expressed regret over the decision but emphasized the necessity of adapting to current market conditions. \"We are committed to ensuring the sustainability of our business and maintaining our competitive edge in other areas. This decision, though difficult, is a step towards realigning our resources and focusing on areas where we can deliver the greatest value to our clients,\" Wells stated.\n\nThe closure of the home delivery service affects a significant portion of Whistl's workforce, with up to 1,800 employees facing uncertainty about their future. The company has pledged to engage in consultations with affected staff, exploring avenues for potential redeployment within the organization or offering support in seeking new employment opportunities.\n\nIndustry analysts suggest that Whistl's decision highlights broader challenges within the postal sector, including the need for innovation and adaptation in a rapidly changing environment. With digital communication continuously eroding traditional mail volumes, postal services are under pressure to diversify and innovate to remain viable.\n\nAs Whistl navigates this transition, the company remains focused on its core offerings and exploring new avenues for growth. Despite the setback, Whistl continues to play a crucial role in the UK's postal landscape, leveraging its expertise to deliver efficient and reliable services to its clientele."
