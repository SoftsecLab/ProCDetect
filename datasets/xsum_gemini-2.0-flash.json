    "prompt": "Plans to convert a disused underground bunker into a music centre have been backed by Wiltshire councillors.",
    "HWT": "Harnham bunker, officially known as Salisbury Urban District Control Centre, has been empty for years. Youth group The Sound Emporium plans to convert it into its new base and said, being underground with thick walls, it's the ideal place for a music venue. But concerns were raised about potential noise, vibration and litter by some of those living nearby. Council officers advised the impact would not be \"unduly harmful\" and there were also letters of support. The plans for a change of use were approved at a meeting of Wiltshire Council's southern area planning committee on Thursday. Ross Sanderson, of the Sound Emporium, told the BBC the venue was \"unique\" and \"inspiring\". \"What better place to have a music venue than underground, with the natural soundproofing of the earth plus between 5ft-10ft thick concrete walls?\" Salisbury City Council owns the bunker, once an old military telephone exchange which became the council's control centre in 1963. The bunker still has some of its old typewriters and fittings - and an escape hatch.",
    "MGT": "Wiltshire councillors have given the green light to proposals for a new music centre housed within a disused underground bunker. The ambitious project aims to transform the once-secret Cold War relic into a vibrant hub for musicians and music enthusiasts.\n\nThe bunker, located just outside of Devizes, has been derelict for decades. Developers envision a state-of-the-art facility boasting multiple rehearsal rooms, a recording studio, and a performance space capable of hosting small concerts and workshops.\n\nSupporters of the plan highlight its potential to boost the local economy and provide much-needed resources for aspiring musicians in the region. Concerns regarding noise pollution from the site were addressed in the planning application, with assurances that soundproofing measures would be implemented to minimize any disruption to nearby residents.\n\nThe conversion is expected to create several new jobs and attract visitors from across the county. Funding for the project is expected to come from a combination of private investment and public grants. Construction is slated to begin in the coming months, with the music centre anticipated to open its doors within the next two years.\n"

    "HWT": "Locke was in charge at Central Park for the second half of last term and guided the club to a play-off win over East Kilbride that kept them in League Two. Brown, who has worked alongside Locke in the past, helped out at Cowden towards the end of last season. The club say their aim remains to secure promotion next season. Cowdenbeath chairman Donald Findlay told the club website: \"I am sorry to see Gary leave. However, in his time at Central Park we have become friends and I always made it plain to him that I would not stand in his way if the opportunity came along to join a bigger club. \"I am well aware of his affection for Hearts, who have acted with absolute propriety in this matter, as I would expect. I will always be grateful for what he and Billy Brown did for the club at the end of the season and I have every confidence that Billy will carry on the good work.\" Locke, who becomes the Tynecastle outfit's principal ambassador, is taking up the post in the \"club's commercial department\" and will also \"work alongside director of football Craig Levein in assisting to monitor the numerous loan players the club have across the country\". The 42-year-old, who played for Hearts from 1992-2001, also managed the Edinburgh side in the 2013-14 season.

    "prompt": "Cuba returned to the United States an inert Hellfire missile that had been wrongly shipped to Havana in June 2014.",
    "HWT": "The missile, which did not contain explosives, had been shipped to Spain for a Nato training exercise, the Wall Street Journal said. It was then taken to Germany and eventually to Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris for onward delivery to Florida. It was instead loaded on to an Air France flight to Havana. The incident could have led to a serious loss of military technology, officials told the Wall Street Journal. The whole affair has been embarrassing for the Americans, who have had to ask the Cubans if they could have their highly sensitive missile back, says the BBC's Will Grant in Havana. The missile arrived on a flight from Paris \"by mistake or mishandling in the country of origin,\" said a Cuban Foreign Ministry statement. \"Cuba acted with seriousness and transparency and co-operated to find a satisfactory solution to this issue,\" it added. The AGM 114 Hellfire is a laser-guided missile that can be deployed from an attack helicopter or an unmanned drone. US officials were worried that Cuba could share the advanced technology inside the missile with countries such as North Korea, China or Russia, sources close to the investigation told the Wall Street Journal. The US and Cuba, old Cold War enemies, restored diplomatic relations in July last year after more than 50 years. The two countries have been working to rebuild their economic and trade ties. An announcement is expected on Tuesday about the reinstatement of scores of commercial flights between US cities and Havana.",
    "MGT": "After a prolonged period of diplomatic negotiations, Cuba has returned to the United States an inert Hellfire missile that was mistakenly delivered to Havana in June 2014. The return of the missile, which occurred recently, marks the closure of a sensitive chapter in relations between the two nations.\n\nThe Hellfire missile, a sophisticated piece of U.S. military technology, was shipped to Cuba in error, sparking concerns within the U.S. government about the potential compromise of sensitive technology. The incident triggered a high-level effort to secure the missile's return, involving diplomatic channels and security agencies.\n\nU.S. officials expressed relief that the missile had been recovered. The U.S. government had been concerned that the Cuban government might share the technology with other countries, including rivals or adversaries of the United States.\n\nThe Cuban government maintained throughout the ordeal that it had no intention of sharing the missile with third parties. Cuban officials stated that they had promptly informed the United States about the mistaken delivery and expressed their willingness to cooperate in resolving the matter.\n\nThe return of the missile comes at a time when relations between the United States and Cuba have experienced periods of both progress and tension. The two countries restored diplomatic relations in 2015 after decades of estrangement, but subsequent administrations have adopted varying approaches to engagement with the island nation.\n\nThe successful recovery of the missile may contribute to a more positive atmosphere between the two countries. It demonstrates the potential for cooperation on matters of mutual concern, even amidst broader disagreements. Both governments have expressed a desire to continue dialogue on issues of security and regional stability. The incident serves as a reminder of the complexities and sensitivities involved in international relations.\n"

    "HWT": "The Oscar-winning director of Aliens and Titanic said he is working on three new Avatar films at the same time. The first film was supposed to be out in December 2016, but Cameron said writing the stories had become \"very involved\". \"There's a layer of complexity in getting the story to work as a saga across three films,\" he explained. Cameron said the goal was to have the scripts for the three movies completed by the end of this month so that filming can begin. \"We're writing three simultaneously and we've done that so that everything tracks throughout the three films,\" he told the Associated Press. \"We're not just going to do one and then make up another one and another one after that. \"And parallel with that, we're doing all the design. So we've designed all the creatures and the environments.\" Cameron said he thought it was important that each film linked forward to the next one in a satisfying way, but also came to a resolution that did not leave the audience hanging. The three films will be shot in New Zealand, where some of the original film was also made. Avatar is the highest-grossing film in history, with box office takings of almost $2.8 billion (Â£1.8 billion). Set in the 22nd Century on a distant planet inhabited by a humanoid race, the sci-fi epic went on to win three Oscars. Cameron, 60, was speaking at an event in Wellington on Wednesday to promote the New Zealand film industry.",
    "MGT": "Fans eagerly awaiting the return to Pandora will have to exercise patience. James Cameron has announced that the highly anticipated sequel to his groundbreaking 2009 film, Avatar, has been pushed back a year. The film, originally slated for a 2016 release, will now grace screens in 2017.\n\nThe delay, while disappointing for many, is attributed to the ambitious scope of the project. Cameron, known for his meticulous attention to detail and groundbreaking visual effects, is reportedly aiming to surpass the original Avatar in terms of technological innovation and immersive storytelling.\n\n\"There's a lot involved in bringing these films to life,\" Cameron stated in a recent interview. \"We want to deliver something truly special, something that lives up to the expectations and continues the story in a meaningful way.\"\n\nThe original Avatar, a cinematic marvel that captivated audiences worldwide, revolutionized 3D filmmaking and set a new standard for visual effects. The film's immersive world, compelling narrative, and environmental themes resonated deeply with viewers, propelling it to become the highest-grossing film of all time.\n\nThe sequel promises to delve deeper into the vibrant ecosystem of Pandora, exploring new regions and introducing new cultures of the Na'vi people. Cameron has hinted at underwater sequences that will showcase the breathtaking beauty and diversity of Pandora's oceans.\n\nWhile the delay may test the patience of fans, Cameron and his team are committed to delivering an unforgettable cinematic experience. The additional time will allow them to refine the visual effects, polish the script, and ensure that the sequel lives up to the legacy of the original Avatar. The world of Pandora awaits, and while the journey may take a little longer, the destination promises to be well worth the wait.\n"

Bournemouth Crown Court heard Joy won the trust of the pensioner, who died earlier this month, when she hired him as her gardener in 2008. He was entrusted to withdraw money for her daily living expenses. In December 2014 he made the first of 107 withdrawals without her knowledge, totalling £32,100. The following November Ms Brady cashed five bonds in the sum of £230,000 and wrote Joy a cheque for £100,000. In March 2016, he received a further £20,000 cheque. He also withdrew money to buy a Land Rover car and set up a direct debit to pay his vehicle insurance. The offences came to light when the pensioner's relatives checked her finances while she was in hospital. In a statement, Ms Brady's family said they were \"desperately sad\" about the \"ugly end\" to her life. Det Insp Andy Dilworth said: \"Russell Joy is nothing more than a callous fraudster. He befriended his victim over a period of many years and quickly earned her trust.\" He said Joy ,who pleaded guilty at a previous hearing to six counts of fraud by abuse of position, would be subject to action under the Proceeds of Crime Act.",

The man, who befriended the elderly woman, exploited her trust to gain access to her finances, ultimately defrauding her of £170,000.\n\nThe court heard how the man initially presented himself as a helpful and supportive companion to the woman, who lived alone. Over time, he gradually gained her confidence, offering assistance with errands and household tasks. This cultivated relationship allowed him to subtly manipulate her into granting him control over her financial affairs.\n\nProsecutors revealed that the man systematically siphoned funds from the woman's bank accounts over a period of several months. He used the money for his own personal gain, including lavish purchases and gambling. The fraud was only discovered when a concerned family member noticed discrepancies in the woman's bank statements.\n\nThe judge presiding over the case condemned the man's actions, describing them as \"despicable and predatory.\" He emphasized the severity of the crime, highlighting the vulnerability of the victim and the significant emotional and financial impact the fraud had on her life. The judge noted that the sentence reflected the gravity of the offense and served as a deterrent to others who might consider exploiting elderly or vulnerable individuals.\n\nThe victim's family expressed relief at the sentence, stating that it brought a sense of justice after a difficult and distressing ordeal. They also expressed gratitude to the authorities for their thorough investigation and prosecution of the case. The family hopes that this case will raise awareness about the importance of safeguarding vulnerable individuals from financial abuse.\n"

    "HWT": "Outside, opposition supporters threw stones and smashed windows before they were dispersed by riot police. Protesters have been trying to disrupt parliament over an EU-brokered deal to improve relations with Serbia. Kosovo unilaterally declared its independence from Serbia in 2008. The opposition first released tear gas in parliament on 8 October, causing two MPs to faint. US Secretary of State John Kerry, on a visit to the capital, Pristina, earlier this month, called for an end to violent scenes in parliament, saying it was \"not the place for tear gas and... not the place for intimidation\". However, opposition MPs released gas canisters again in the parliamentary chamber on Monday, forcing a suspension of proceedings. A large group of plainclothes police officers donned gas masks as the chamber was cleared. One of the MPs who released the gas, Glauk Konjufca, said it was \"a collective action by the opposition\". \"Others have done this too, and we will continue to do this in the future. Our breaching of the law is nothing compared to the damage that is being done by these agreements.\" The opposition is particularly opposed to a deal to give more autonomy to Kosovo's ethnic Serb minority, which they say could increase Serbia's influence. The vote on next year's €1.67bn (£1.1bn) budget resumed in a side room, with only MPs from the governing coalition present and was approved, Reuters news agency reported. The US ambassador to Kosovo, Greg Delawie, condemned the disorder, saying it was \"very disappointing\" that Mr Kerry's calls had gone unheeded.",
    "MGT": "PRISTINA - Kosovo's parliament was once again engulfed in chaos on Friday as opposition members released tear gas, disrupting a crucial vote on the 2016 budget. This marks the sixth time in just over two months that such disruptive tactics have been employed by the protesting MPs.\n\nThe incident occurred as lawmakers were preparing to debate and vote on the government's proposed budget for the upcoming year. Opposition MPs, vehemently opposed to a series of agreements with Serbia and Montenegro, initiated their protest by releasing tear gas canisters within the parliamentary chamber.\n\nThe noxious fumes quickly filled the room, forcing lawmakers to evacuate and halting the proceedings. Many MPs were seen coughing and covering their faces as they rushed to escape the tear gas.\n\nThe opposition's actions are rooted in their strong disapproval of a deal brokered with Serbia, granting greater autonomy to Serb-populated areas in Kosovo. They also oppose a border demarcation agreement with Montenegro, claiming it cedes valuable Kosovar territory.\n\nThese agreements, supported by the government, are seen by the opposition as a betrayal of Kosovo's sovereignty and national interests. They have vowed to continue disrupting parliamentary sessions until the agreements are revoked.\n\nThe government has condemned the opposition's actions, calling them undemocratic and harmful to the country's stability. Prime Minister Isa Mustafa has accused the opposition of resorting to violence and obstructionism to achieve their political goals.\n\nThe repeated use of tear gas in parliament has created a climate of instability and uncertainty in Kosovo. It has also raised concerns about the country's ability to function as a democratic institution.\n\nInternational observers have expressed concern over the ongoing political crisis and have urged both the government and the opposition to engage in constructive dialogue to resolve their differences. They have also called on all parties to respect the rule of law and to refrain from violence and disruptive tactics.\n\nThe parliamentary session has been adjourned, and it is unclear when the vote on the budget will be rescheduled.

    "prompt": "Manufacturing sales from Northern Ireland were worth £13.3bn last year, the highest value on record.",
    "HWT": "External sales were up by 3.2% over the year, a rise of £415m. The biggest market for those goods is Great Britain which accounts for £8.1bn - just under half the total value. The Republic of Ireland is the next single biggest market at £1.3bn, followed by the rest of the EU at £1.2bn. Sales to all other parts of the world were £2.6bn. The figures suggest that Northern Ireland manufacturing may be benefiting from the recoveries in the wider British and Irish economies. Sales to GB were up by 6.2% while sales to the Republic of Ireland were up by 5.3%. However sales to other EU countries fell by 13%. The figures are produced by the  Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency (NISRA). Richard Ramsey Ulster Bank chief economist in Northern Ireland said one of the key themes from the figures is the growing importance of the GB market for NI's manufacturing firms. He said: \"Whilst there have been huge efforts by policymakers to encourage local firms to export to markets outside of the UK, Great Britain has been the fastest growing market for NI's manufacturers following the downturn. \"Since 2007/08, NI's manufacturing sales to GB have increased by almost one quarter (+23%) or £1.5bn. \"In 2012/13 NI's manufacturers sold six times more goods, in value terms, to the GB market than they did to the Republic of Ireland. \"Back in 2007/08,  local manufacturers sold just over three times more goods to the GB market than they exported to the Republic of Ireland.\"",
    "MGT": "Manufacturing sales in Northern Ireland have reached an unprecedented high, hitting £13.3 billion in the past year. This marks a significant milestone for the region's manufacturing sector, showcasing its resilience and growth potential in a challenging global economic landscape. The record-breaking figures underscore the sector's vital contribution to Northern Ireland's overall economy and employment.\n\nSeveral factors have contributed to this surge in manufacturing sales. Increased demand for Northern Ireland's products in both domestic and international markets has played a crucial role. The region's manufacturers have successfully capitalized on emerging opportunities, particularly in sectors such as aerospace, food and drink, and advanced engineering.\n\nFurthermore, investments in innovation and technology have enhanced the competitiveness of Northern Ireland's manufacturing firms. By embracing new technologies and adopting advanced manufacturing processes, these companies have been able to improve efficiency, reduce costs, and develop higher-value products. This has enabled them to attract new customers and expand their market share.\n\nGovernment support and initiatives have also played a key role in fostering the growth of the manufacturing sector. Targeted programs aimed at promoting innovation, skills development, and export opportunities have provided valuable assistance to local manufacturers. These initiatives have helped to create a more favorable business environment and encourage investment in the sector.\n\nThe record-breaking manufacturing sales figures are expected to have a positive impact on the Northern Ireland economy. The increased revenue generated by the sector will contribute to higher tax receipts, which can be used to fund public services and infrastructure projects. Moreover, the growth of the manufacturing sector is likely to create new employment opportunities, benefiting local communities and reducing unemployment rates.\n\nLooking ahead, the manufacturing sector in Northern Ireland is poised for continued growth. With a strong foundation in place and a commitment to innovation, local manufacturers are well-positioned to capitalize on future opportunities. However, it is important to address ongoing challenges such as skills shortages and supply chain disruptions to ensure the sector's long-term sustainability.\n"

A year of terror in Germany Berlin attack: Islamic State claims responsibility How attacks are forcing Germany to examine civil freedoms Dressed in a blue pullover and a black cap, he hid his face behind a folder as he took his seat in the courtroom, reported AFP news agency. Officers armed with machine guns were stationed outside the court. Shaas al-M faces charges of being a member of a foreign terrorist organisation, which carries up to 10 years in jail, and violating laws governing military weapons. In a previous statement (in German), the court detailed allegations of Shaas al-M's involvement in IS operations in Syria, including participating in the siege of the airport at Deir al-Zour, handling a Kalashnikov gun and helping supply fighters with food. Once he had arrived in Germany, he maintained intensive contact with IS superiors, it says, and began to undertake visits to Berlin where he explored landmarks including Alexanderplatz, the Brandenburg Gate and the Reichstag parliament building, reporting his findings back to his contacts. He is also accused of arranging for at least one person to travel to Syria to fight, and offering his services to assist would-be attackers travelling to Germany. The court has scheduled some 25 hearings to run until April.",
    "MGT": "BERLIN - A 21-year-old Syrian man appeared in a Berlin court today, facing charges of espionage and supporting a foreign terrorist organization. The prosecution alleges that the man, identified only as Mazen G. due to German privacy laws, was tasked by the Islamic State (ISIS) to gather intelligence on potential targets in the German capital.\n\nProsecutors contend that Mazen G. traveled to Germany in 2022, ostensibly as a refugee, but in reality, he was on a mission for the extremist group. They claim he received specific instructions from ISIS operatives to identify locations suitable for future terrorist attacks. These locations reportedly included Jewish institutions, government buildings, and transportation hubs.\n\nThe indictment states that Mazen G. meticulously documented these sites, taking photographs and videos, and compiled detailed reports on security measures, accessibility, and potential vulnerabilities. This information, prosecutors argue, was intended to be used by ISIS to plan and execute attacks in Berlin.\n\nThe trial is expected to be complex, relying heavily on evidence gathered from the defendant's electronic devices and communications. Investigators reportedly uncovered encrypted messages and files linking Mazen G. to known ISIS members in Syria and other countries.\n\nMazen G. has denied the charges, claiming he was coerced into working for ISIS and that he never intended to harm anyone in Germany. His defense team argues that he was merely trying to survive and protect his family back in Syria, who were allegedly threatened by the terrorist group.\n\nThe trial is being closely watched by German security officials, who are increasingly concerned about the threat posed by ISIS sympathizers and returnees from conflict zones. Germany has been on high alert for terrorist attacks since a series of incidents in recent years, including a 2016 truck attack on a Christmas market in Berlin that killed 12 people.\n\nIf convicted, Mazen G. could face a lengthy prison sentence. The trial is expected to last several weeks, with numerous witnesses scheduled to testify, including intelligence experts and former ISIS members. The outcome of the case could have significant implications for Germany's counter-terrorism efforts and its approach to dealing with individuals suspected of supporting extremist groups.\n"

    "HWT": "Anne Thomas, of Linc Care, made the comments in light of Welsh government plans published on Tuesday to strengthen care homes regulations. A new law will make care home owners more accountable for their services. Health Minister Mark Drakeford said lessons had been learned from previous care sector scandals. These include the collapsed Operation Jasmine, the UK's biggest investigation into alleged neglect at nursing homes in south Wales, which was carried out by Gwent Police. The operation ended after the owner of some of the care homes concerned, Dr Prana Das, suffered a brain injury and could not stand trial. Ms Thomas said: \"The level of acuity and dependency in nursing homes has changed dramatically over the past few years and the current regulation really looks at the wrong things and so it's great to have something that looks at the kind of evidence that we need to provide [to show] that we're looking after people well.\" According to the Welsh government, the Regulation of Social Care Bill will: Health Minister Mark Drakeford said: \"We have learned lessons from Southern Cross, Mid Staffs, Winterbourne Operation Jasmine and other scandals where people being cared for were badly let down by services.\"",
    "MGT": "A leading figure in Welsh social care has voiced serious concerns about the current inspection regime, arguing it is outdated and ineffective. Mario Kreft MBE, director of the Pendine Park care organisation, believes the system needs urgent reform to better reflect the realities of modern social care provision.\n\nKreft stated the existing framework places undue emphasis on bureaucratic processes rather than focusing on the quality of care delivered to vulnerable individuals. He emphasized the need for a more person-centered approach to inspections, one that truly understands the complexities and nuances of providing support to those in need.\n\nPendine Park, a major provider of social care services across Wales, has consistently advocated for improvements in the sector. Kreft's comments highlight growing frustration among providers who feel the current inspection regime fails to accurately capture the dedication and commitment of staff.\n\nHe suggests that inspections should prioritize direct observations of care practices and meaningful engagement with residents and their families. This, he argues, would provide a more holistic and accurate assessment of the services being provided.\n\nThe Welsh government has yet to respond to Kreft's specific concerns, but the debate surrounding the effectiveness of social care inspections is likely to intensify in the coming months. Reform advocates hope to see a more collaborative approach between providers and regulators, working together to ensure the highest standards of care for all individuals in Wales.\n"

    "prompt": "Japan's authorities have seized the passport of a journalist planning to travel to Syria, local media say.",
    "HWT": "It was necessary to confiscate Yuichi Sugimoto's passport in order to protect his life, the authorities said. The 59-year-old photographer, who had planned to enter Syria on 27 February, described the move as a threat to the freedom of press. Two Japanese hostages were killed by Islamic State (IS) militants in Syria in January. However, Mr Sugimoto told reporters that he had no intention to visit areas controlled by IS. It is said to be the first time the Japanese government has taken such a step. The foreign ministry says it is in accordance with a provision in the country's passport law, that allows a confiscation in order to protect the passport holder's life. Mr Sugimoto, who has covered conflict zones in Iraq and Syria before, insists he has always taken precautions and retreated when in danger. \"What happens to my freedom to travel and freedom of the press?\" he told the Japanese paper Asahi Shimbun. He said he was planning to travel to Turkey before entering Syria with a former soldier who had previously worked for Kenji Goto, a fellow journalist who was taken hostage, and killed in Syria last month. A second Japanese citizen, Haruna Yukawa, was also kidnapped and killed by IS militants. After the handling of the hostage crisis, approval ratings for the government of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe have gone up, recent polls show. Two separate surveys conducted by the Yomiuri newspaper and Japan's news agency Kyodo indicate that up to 60% of people approve of the way the government dealt with the crisis. A similar percentage also said Japan's support to countries affected IS should continue to be non-military. In January, Mr Abe promised $200m (Â£130m) in non-military aid for countries fighting Islamic State. Officials said that much of the $200m fund would be focused on helping refugees displaced from Syria and Iraq.",
    "MGT": "Japanese authorities have reportedly seized the passport of a freelance journalist who intended to travel to Syria, according to multiple local news outlets. The action, taken under a rarely invoked provision of the passport law, effectively prevents the journalist from leaving the country and entering the conflict zone.\n\nWhile authorities have not officially confirmed the identity of the journalist, reports suggest it is Yuichi Sugimoto, a seasoned war zone reporter who has previously covered conflicts in Iraq, Afghanistan, and other volatile regions. Sugimoto has reportedly been vocal about his plans to travel to Syria to document the ongoing humanitarian crisis and the fight against extremist groups.\n\nThe government's decision to confiscate the passport stems from concerns about the journalist's safety and the potential for him to be taken hostage or otherwise harmed in the dangerous environment of Syria. Officials cited Article 19 of the Passport Act, which allows the government to invalidate a passport if there is a \"high possibility\" that the passport holder will engage in activities that could endanger their life or safety in a foreign country.\n\nThis move has ignited a debate within Japan regarding freedom of the press and the government's role in protecting its citizens in conflict zones. Supporters of the government's action argue that it is a necessary measure to prevent Japanese citizens from putting themselves in harm's way, particularly in regions where the government has limited or no ability to provide assistance. They point to the past instances of Japanese citizens being taken hostage or killed by extremist groups in the Middle East as justification for a cautious approach.\n\nHowever, critics argue that the passport seizure infringes upon the journalist's right to report freely and that it sets a dangerous precedent for government censorship. They contend that journalists play a crucial role in informing the public about important global events, and that restricting their access to conflict zones undermines the public's right to know. Some legal experts have also questioned the government's interpretation of the Passport Act, arguing that it could be used to suppress dissenting voices and limit journalistic freedom.\n\nThe incident has prompted discussions among media organizations and human rights groups in Japan, with many calling for greater transparency and clarity regarding the government's criteria for invoking Article 19 of the Passport Act. The case is likely to continue to fuel debate about the balance between national security concerns and the protection of fundamental freedoms.\n"

With fellow Glasgow centres Alex Dunbar, Peter Horne and Richie Vernon all ruled out of at least the start of the Six Nations - or in Vernon's case, the entire Championship - Bennett's possible availability would be a major boost. \"A fully-fit Bennett is a very good player,\" Taylor noted. \"There is a reason he played so well in the World Cup, so it is great he is back in the mix.\" Scotland wing Sean Maitland has also been declared fully fit after coming through a full game for London Irish on the weekend. But Harlequins wing Tim Visser is still a \"couple of weeks off\" and unlikely to be available before Scotland's third Six Nations match against Italy in Rome. With Matt Scott likely to start at inside centre, Bennett is competing with Saracens' Duncan Taylor for the number 13 jersey against England. The in-form Taylor has been a vital source of intelligence on England's likely defensive set-up, with new Red Rose assistant coach Paul Gustard set to bring his famed 'wolf-pack' approach from Saracens into the national squad. \"I think Duncan is caught between a rock and a hard place,\" grinned Taylor. \"He feels like he has been giving out all this information on how Saracens, and now England, are defending. That is hard when there are other guys in our group from the likes of Gloucester and Bath who can benefit. \"But that is international rugby. We have been talking about how they defend and Duncan gives us an insight into what to expect. But we will be trying to concentrate on what we do.\"",

However, his return to training has been met with enthusiasm by both coaches and teammates alike.\n\nThe Glasgow Warriors player brings a wealth of experience and physicality to the Scottish backline. His ability to break the line, coupled with his solid defensive capabilities, makes him a valuable asset in both attack and defense. His potential inclusion in the starting XV would undoubtedly bolster Scotland's chances of securing a victory against a formidable English side.\n\nWhile the Scottish coaching staff remain cautiously optimistic, they have indicated that Bennett has a \"good chance\" of featuring in the matchday squad. A final decision on his selection will be made later in the week, following further assessment of his fitness and performance in training.\n\n\"It's great to have Mark back in the mix,\" said a source within the Scottish camp. \"He's a quality player and a real competitor. He's been working hard to get back to full fitness, and we're pleased with his progress. We'll continue to monitor him closely and make a decision that's in the best interests of the team.\"\n\nThe return of Bennett comes at a crucial time for Scotland, who are looking to build on their recent successes in the Six Nations. They have emerged as a genuine force in the tournament. A victory against England would not only be a significant morale boost but also a statement of intent as they aim to challenge for the championship title.\n\nThe Calcutta Cup match is always a fiercely contested affair, steeped in history and tradition. Both teams will be eager to claim bragging rights and kick off their Six Nations campaigns with a win. With Mark Bennett potentially back in the fold, Scotland will be hoping to unleash their full attacking potential and secure a memorable victory in front of their home crowd. The atmosphere at Murrayfield is expected to be electric as the two nations lock horns in what promises to be a thrilling encounter.\n"

    "HWT": "Maria Pridmore, 36, was jailed for three years in August after she admitted a string of frauds. They included obtaining more than £16,000 in housing benefit, council tax benefit and income support. Pridmore, who was described in court as a \"Walter Mitty\" fraudster, also stole over £30,000 from four women. She appeared by video-link at Lincoln Crown Court from Drake Hall prison in Staffordshire where she is serving her sentence. The court heard Pridmore, a former drug addict, benefitted by £56,679 from her crimes but had no available assets which could be confiscated to pay back her victims. Judge Simon Hirst ruled that in the circumstances a nominal sum of £1 should be paid. Pridmore made news in 2012 when she gave birth to a daughter after previously suffering 14 miscarriages, a stillbirth and the death of an infant son. At her sentence hearing, the court heard the former nurse had been claiming to be a lone-parent with dependent children in order to get benefits, but at various times failed to declare she had moved or was living with her then partner as man and wife. Pridmore also pocketed more than £30,000 from friends and two elderly women, and used the bank details of one of her victims to pay for a £60 taxi fare to attend a court hearing. She stole almost £8,000 from one victim, an 84-year-old vulnerable woman. Pridmore, of Angel Lane, Holbeach, Lincolnshire, previously admitted seven charges of benefit fraud between August 2010 and March 2013, 19 charges of fraud and theft between January 2013 and May 2016 and stealing her father's flat-packed kitchen in April 2015.",
    "MGT": "A woman who defrauded the benefits system and exploited vulnerable individuals, pocketing over £50,000, has been ordered to repay a mere £1, sparking public outrage and raising questions about the effectiveness of the justice system in recovering ill-gotten gains.\n\nThe woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, systematically claimed false benefits over a period of several years, providing fabricated information and exploiting loopholes in the system. Simultaneously, she targeted vulnerable individuals, often elderly or with disabilities, manipulating them into handing over their savings under false pretenses.\n\nHer fraudulent activities were eventually uncovered following a lengthy investigation by the Department for Work and Pensions and local authorities. Evidence presented in court detailed a web of deceit, revealing how she had amassed a substantial sum of money through calculated deception.\n\nDespite the gravity of her crimes and the significant financial loss suffered by the public and her victims, the court heard that the woman had no assets available for confiscation. Her legal team argued that she was now penniless and reliant on state benefits, rendering her unable to make any meaningful repayment.\n\nThe judge, while acknowledging the public's frustration, stated that the law only allowed for a confiscation order to the value of available assets. In this case, that was deemed to be a nominal £1.\n\nThe outcome has been met with widespread condemnation. Critics argue that the current system fails to adequately address cases where criminals have squandered their ill-gotten gains, leaving victims and taxpayers to bear the brunt of their actions. Calls are growing for a review of the legislation to ensure that those who profit from crime are held accountable and made to repay their debts to society, regardless of their current financial circumstances.\n\nThe case has ignited a debate about the need for more robust measures to track and recover assets obtained through illegal means, even if those assets have been dissipated. Some suggest that alternative sentencing options, such as community service focused on compensating victims, should be considered in such cases.\n"

The authority is looking at increasing council tax by 3.7% and making cuts of £17m. Costs for burials as well as births, deaths and marriage registration and school meals could all rise in 2017-18.

    "HWT": "Mr Hammarskjold died in a plane crash in what is now Zambia in 1961, but the cause of the crash has been disputed. There have been claims that the plane was shot down, but a previous UN enquiry did not reach a definitive conclusion. The Swedish diplomat was on his way to negotiate a ceasefire in the breakaway Congolese state of Katanga. He was trying to mediate between Congo's Soviet-backed government and Moise Tshombe, who had declared independence for the mineral-rich province of Katanga. He was flying to Ndola, in what was then Northern Rhodesia, to meet Mr Tshombe, who was backed by former colonial power Belgium and some Western mining interests. The UN set up this new enquiry after a group of independent investigators said that there was significant new evidence concerning Hammarskjold's death. They said the evidence was \"persuasive\" that \"the aircraft was subjected to some form of attack\". The commission said that the US National Security Agency (NSA) might hold crucial evidence. It said that given the NSA's worldwide monitoring activities at that time, \"it is highly likely\" that the radio traffic on 18-19 September 1961 was recorded by the NSA and possibly also by the CIA. The report said: \"Authenticated recordings of any such cockpit narrative or radio messages, if located, would furnish potentially conclusive evidence of what happened.\" The UN panel will now assess this new information and report back by the end of June.",
    "MGT": "A United Nations enquiry is set to begin, delving into the unresolved circumstances surrounding the death of former Secretary-General Dag Hammarskjold. Hammarskjold, the second person to hold the UN's top position, died in a plane crash near Ndola, Northern Rhodesia (now Zambia), in September 1961. The incident occurred while he was on a peace mission to the Congo, a nation then embroiled in a violent crisis following its independence.\n\nNumerous theories have swirled around Hammarskjold's death for decades. While the initial Rhodesian inquiry concluded the crash was due to pilot error, this explanation has been widely disputed. Alternative narratives suggest the plane was shot down or sabotaged, potentially by forces opposed to Hammarskjold's efforts to maintain the Congo's territorial integrity and prevent foreign interference.\n\nThe new UN investigation aims to address lingering questions and examine fresh evidence that has emerged in recent years. This includes witness testimonies and declassified documents from various national archives. The inquiry will focus on determining whether foul play contributed to the crash, and if so, identifying those responsible.\n\nThe resumption of the investigation signifies a renewed commitment to uncovering the truth behind a tragedy that has cast a long shadow over the United Nations. Hammarskjold was a respected diplomat known for his dedication to international peace and security. His untimely death remains a point of contention and a subject of intense speculation. The findings of this inquiry are eagerly awaited by historians, diplomats, and those seeking closure on this historical event. The outcome could have significant implications for understanding the complexities of Cold War-era politics and the role of the UN in navigating international conflicts.\n"

Assistant coroner Johanna Thompson, at Norfolk Coroner's Court, said they died from gunshot wounds to the head. At the hearings in Norwich, she said she requested forensic officers to identify their bodies by using DNA evidence. She said: \"Mrs Muncaster was found at her home property by police, having suffered what appeared to be a gunshot injury to the head. \"A post-mortem report confirmed the cause as being due to a shotgun wound to the head. \"Mr Muncaster was found in the front garden of the property, having suffered what appeared to be a gunshot injury to the head.\" She added that a post-mortem report confirmed that as the cause of his death.

    "MGT": "An inquest has heard that DNA evidence was crucial in identifying a married couple found deceased at their residence. The identification process relied heavily on forensic analysis conducted at the scene and in the laboratory. Details surrounding the circumstances of their deaths remain under investigation, but authorities confirmed no foul play is suspected.\n\nThe couple, identified as John and Mary Smith, were discovered at their home on Elm Street last Tuesday. Police were called to the residence after concerned neighbors reported not having seen the couple for several days. Upon entering the home, officers found both individuals deceased.\n\nDue to the condition of the bodies, visual identification proved challenging, necessitating the use of DNA analysis. Forensic officers meticulously collected samples from the scene, which were then compared against existing DNA profiles to confirm the identities of the deceased. The process, while time-consuming, provided definitive confirmation.\n\nThe inquest proceedings revealed that the cause of death is still undetermined, pending further toxicology reports. Preliminary findings suggest no signs of forced entry or struggle, leading investigators to believe there was no external involvement in the incident.\n\nFamily members of the Smiths have been notified and are cooperating with authorities. They have requested privacy during this difficult time. The community has expressed shock and sadness at the news, with many remembering the Smiths as active and engaged members of the neighborhood.\n\nAuthorities are expected to release more information once the toxicology reports are finalized and the investigation is complete. The coroner has adjourned the inquest until a later date, pending the submission of all relevant evidence. The case highlights the importance of forensic science in modern investigations, particularly in situations where traditional identification methods are insufficient.\n"

Vandals scrawled their names on top of the artworks in French and Arabic. The Ennedi plateau was declared a Unesco world heritage site in 2016. \"It's an African story and they wanted to destroy that. \"That's why I'm talking about a tragedy, because it's a part of us,\" said Mr Haroun, who is also an award-winning filmmaker.

The head of the UN's cultural body in the country, Abdelkerim Adoum Bahar, told the BBC that he thought the damage could be repaired. Thousands of images of people and animals have been painted and carved into the rock surface of caves, canyons and shelters in the area, according to UN cultural agency Unesco.

These paintings, some dating back thousands of years, offer a unique glimpse into the lives, beliefs, and environment of early Saharan communities. They depict scenes of hunting, livestock, daily life, and abstract symbols, providing invaluable insights into the region's rich history and cultural heritage.\n\nThe extent of the damage is still being assessed, but initial reports indicate that graffiti has been scrawled over some of the most important and accessible rock art sites within the Ennedi Massif. This act of vandalism not only defaces irreplaceable cultural treasures but also threatens the integrity of the entire World Heritage site.\n\nAuthorities are launching an investigation to identify and apprehend the perpetrators. The Chadian government is working with UNESCO and other international organizations to develop strategies for better protecting the site and preventing future acts of vandalism. These measures may include increased security patrols, enhanced community engagement, and the implementation of stricter regulations regarding access to the more vulnerable areas of the Ennedi Massif.\n\nThe incident has sparked widespread condemnation from archaeologists, historians, and cultural heritage advocates around the world. Experts emphasize the need for greater awareness and respect for cultural heritage sites, particularly those located in remote and fragile environments. The defacement of the Ennedi cave paintings serves as a stark reminder of the vulnerability of these irreplaceable treasures and the importance of safeguarding them for future generations.\n"

    "HWT": "The new buzzwords are to be \"outcomes\" and \"indicators\". They are words most people living in Scotland or Finland will be very familiar with. Because Stormont's administrators have been studying what happens in those countries and they like what they see. Scotland has a series of sixteen National Outcomes which describe what the Government there wants to do over the next ten years. This so-called outcomes based approach to government focuses on actual results achieved. The theory is it allows the government and wider public sector to focus on making sustainable improvements to public services and the quality of life for people in Scotland. A series of indicators allow them to track progress towards the achievements of these outcomes. Sources close to the negotiations for a programme for government at Stormont say this is the model they intend to follow. One source said it is about \"doing things differently\" and denied the change was merely cosmetic. As a first step a \"framework\" programme for government will be produced in just over a fortnight. It will then go out to consultation. At the end of this year it will be replaced with a detailed programme for government. There will also be a budget, not for one year but for the next three to four years. And there will be documents setting out strategies on the economy, capital investment and social policy strategy. Sources say this is not a programme for one Assembly mandate but for a 10 - 15 year period. They say it will also require the civil service to be \"more outward facing.\" Politically, this seems the model Sinn FÃ©in and the DUP intend to move forward with - with or without the other parties. Can the SDLP, Ulster Unionists and Alliance agree to go into the next Executive on the basis of a \"framework\"  programme knowing they won't get the real detail for another seven months?",
    "MGT": "After years of political deadlock and instability, Northern Ireland's system of government is poised for a significant overhaul. Discussions are underway at Stormont and Westminster, focusing on reforms designed to promote greater collaboration and prevent future collapses of the power-sharing executive.\n\nCentral to the proposed changes is a re-evaluation of the petition of concern mechanism. Originally intended to protect minority rights, it has frequently been used to block legislation and disrupt the functioning of the Assembly. Proposals include raising the threshold required to trigger a petition of concern and limiting its application to only the most fundamental issues.\n\nAnother key area of focus is the designation of ministers. Currently, ministers are designated as either unionist, nationalist, or other, reflecting the community background of their parties. This system has been criticized for reinforcing sectarian divisions and hindering cross-community cooperation. Reform options include moving towards a system of ministerial designation based on portfolios or expertise, rather than community identity.\n\nThe role of the First and Deputy First Ministers is also under scrutiny. Although technically equal in power, the titles themselves can be seen as symbolic of the historic divisions in Northern Ireland. Proposals include renaming the positions as Joint First Ministers or Co-Premiers to emphasize their shared responsibility and promote a more collaborative approach to leadership.\n\nThese potential reforms are not without their challenges. Concerns have been raised about the potential impact on minority rights and the need to ensure that all communities feel represented and protected. Negotiations are ongoing to find a balance between promoting stability and safeguarding the principles of power-sharing and inclusivity.\n\nPolitical analysts suggest the reforms could create a more stable and effective system of government. By reducing the potential for deadlock and promoting greater cooperation, it is hoped that Northern Ireland can move towards a more prosperous and peaceful future. However, the success of these reforms will depend on the willingness of all parties to compromise and work together in the best interests of the region. The coming months will be crucial as the details of the reforms are finalized and implemented.\n"

    "HWT": "When the law comes into effect on 1 January, the Golden State will become the first to outlaw the practice for people under the age of 18. The bill was backed by mental health groups, and gay rights activists say reparative or \"conversion therapy\" can increase risk of depression or suicide. Counselling and prayer is used to help some Christians deal with gay urges. The bill was signed over the weekend along with more than 100 pieces of legislation sent to the governor by California's state legislature. Two Christian groups, the California-based Pacific Justice Institute and the Florida-based Liberty Counsel will challenge the law. The Liberty Counsel said it planned to argue in its lawsuit that the measure infringes on the First Amendment and equal protection rights. In his statement, Gov Brown said sexual orientation change efforts \"have no basis in science or medicine and they will now be relegated to the dustbin of quackery\". The Human Rights Campaign, an advocacy group, said: \"We're grateful to Governor Brown for standing with California's children. \"LGBT [lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender] youth will now be protected from a practice that has not only been debunked as junk science, but has been proven to have drastically negative effects on their well-being,\" the gay rights advocate added, urging other states to take up similar measures. But the National Association for Research and Therapy on Homosexuality said the bill was a \"legislative over-reach\". Some conservative groups have said banning the therapy would restrict a parent's right to care for children going through gender confusion. California is embroiled in a long-standing legal tussle over gay marriage. A law called Proposition 8 banned same-sex marriage in California just months after it had been introduced. But a court overturned the ban in 2010. After an appeal was upheld, the matter may now come before the US Supreme Court for a final ruling.",
    "MGT": "SACRAMENTO - California has become the first state in the nation to ban so-called \"conversion therapy\" for minors, a practice aimed at changing a person's sexual orientation. Governor Jerry Brown signed the landmark legislation into law on Saturday, marking a significant victory for LGBT rights advocates.\n\nThe new law, which will take effect on January 1, 2013, prohibits licensed therapists from engaging in practices that seek to alter the sexual orientation or gender identity of individuals under the age of 18. This includes treatments designed to eliminate or reduce same-sex attractions. Violators of the law could face disciplinary action from state licensing boards.\n\nSupporters of the ban hailed the move as a crucial step in protecting vulnerable youth from harmful and ineffective practices. They argued that conversion therapy, often rooted in religious or moral beliefs, can lead to depression, anxiety, self-harm, and even suicide among LGBT youth.\n\n\"This bill affirms that all youth in California deserve to grow up in an environment that is safe, supportive, and free from discrimination,\" said State Senator Ted Lieu, the bill's author. \"These practices have been shown to have devastating effects on young people, and they have no basis in science or medicine.\"\n\nOpponents of the law, primarily religious and conservative groups, argued that it infringes on the rights of parents to seek the therapy they believe is best for their children. They also claimed that the ban violates the First Amendment rights of therapists to practice their profession according to their beliefs.\n\n\"This law is a dangerous intrusion into the doctor-patient relationship and the rights of parents to seek help for their children,\" said Brad Dacus, president of the Pacific Justice Institute, a conservative legal organization. \"It will prevent therapists from providing legitimate counseling services to young people who are struggling with unwanted same-sex attractions.\"\n\nThe signing of the bill comes amid a growing national debate over the use of conversion therapy, with several states considering similar legislation. While the practice is not widely accepted by mainstream medical and mental health organizations, it continues to be offered by some therapists and religious groups.\n\nThe American Psychological Association and other leading professional organizations have condemned conversion therapy, stating that there is no scientific evidence to support its effectiveness and that it can be harmful.

The review will look to identify obstacles to people in deprived areas starting new businesses. \"Entrepreneurship can play an important role in supporting economic growth and creating jobs in our most disadvantaged communities,\" said Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith. \"However, people living in those areas face a range of additional barriers they need to overcome in starting and growing businesses.\" The government said these barriers included a lack of business and social networks, and a lack of inspiring role models. It asked Ms Mone to draw on her own experiences, which included leaving school with no qualifications and having a child at 18. \"It's an honour to be appointed to lead this review because I know how tough it can be setting up successful businesses,\" she said. \"My philosophy is that it does not matter where you are from, what education you have, or if you are from an affluent background or not, you can make it if you work hard, set your goals and never give up.\" Ms Mone co-founded the original Ultimo parent company MJM International with her ex-husband Michael in 1996, and created brands including Ultimo Miracle Shapewear and Miss Ultimo. She was awarded an OBE in 2010.",
    "MGT": "Michelle Mone, a Scottish entrepreneur, has been tasked by the government with leading a comprehensive review aimed at boosting start-up activity in areas across the UK grappling with high unemployment rates. The appointment signals a renewed focus on fostering economic growth and opportunity in regions that have been disproportionately affected by economic downturns and lack of investment.\n\nMone, known for her successful lingerie business, will be responsible for identifying the key barriers that prevent individuals in these areas from launching and scaling their own businesses. The review will delve into a range of factors, including access to funding, availability of mentorship and training programs, and the overall business environment.\n\nThe government hopes that Mone's experience as a self-made businesswoman will provide valuable insights into the challenges faced by aspiring entrepreneurs from disadvantaged backgrounds. Her review is expected to generate actionable recommendations that can be implemented to create a more level playing field and unlock the potential of untapped talent.\n\nThe review will involve extensive consultations with local communities, business leaders, and relevant stakeholders. The findings will be used to inform the development of new policies and initiatives designed to stimulate entrepreneurship and create sustainable jobs in areas of high unemployment.\n\nThe government has emphasized its commitment to leveling up the country and ensuring that everyone has the opportunity to succeed, regardless of their background or location. Mone's review is considered a crucial step in achieving this goal by empowering individuals to take control of their economic futures and contribute to the growth of their communities. The findings of the review are expected to be published later this year.\n"

    "HWT": "Sean Sullivan, 20, had only passed his test the day before the crash which killed Timothy Malone near Cefn Bryn Common, Gower, on 31 July 2016. Swansea Crown Court heard Sullivan had ignored pleas from his passengers to slow down. He pleaded guilty to one count of death by dangerous driving and one of causing serious injury by dangerous driving. Sullivan also admitted two other charges of dangerous driving involving two other drivers. Prosecuting, Ian Wright said airbag data from Sullivan's car showed four seconds before impact, it was travelling at 98mph and the throttle was at 100% at 5,000 revs. \"Essentially, his foot was touching the floorboard,\" he said. The court heard Mr Malone, who was was staying in a nearby caravan with his wife, Yvonne Howard, was unable to take evasive action or avoid the head on collision on the country road. Addressing Sullivan in court, Mrs Howard said: \"I am haunted by the images of the terrible events of that night - the last time I saw him. \"I cannot heal my tattered heart and soul. I go to sleep in sadness and wake up to sadness. My face is wet with tears every day.\" Judge Peter Heywood sentenced Sullivan to five years in a young offenders' institution. He will also be banned from driving for four years following his release. Speaking after the case, Inspector Steve Davies of South Wales Police, said: \"Our thoughts, as ever, are with the family and friends of Timothy Malone who lost his life in such devastating circumstances at Cefn Bryn in Gower, last summer. \"This tragic loss of the life has once again highlighted the consequences of a young and inexperienced driver, driving at excessive speed, which puts drivers, passengers and innocent road users at risk of serious injury or death.\"",
    "MGT": "A newly licensed driver has been sentenced to five years in prison following a high-speed collision that resulted in the death of a holidaymaker. The crash, which occurred on a rural stretch of road, involved the defendant, who was reportedly traveling at speeds exceeding 100mph.\n\nThe victim, who was visiting the area for a vacation, was pronounced dead at the scene. Authorities confirmed that the driver, a recent recipient of their driving license, was the sole occupant of the other vehicle involved.\n\nDuring the trial, prosecutors presented evidence indicating the driver's excessive speed and reckless behavior leading up to the crash. Witnesses testified to seeing the vehicle speeding and weaving through traffic shortly before the incident. The defense argued that while their client acknowledged the excessive speed, other factors, such as road conditions, may have contributed to the accident.\n\nThe judge, in delivering the sentence, emphasized the devastating consequences of reckless driving and the importance of responsible behavior behind the wheel. The judge stated that the driver's actions demonstrated a blatant disregard for the safety of others and warranted a significant custodial sentence.\n\nIn addition to the prison sentence, the driver has also been banned from driving for a period of seven years following their release. The victim's family expressed a sense of relief at the verdict, acknowledging that while it wouldn't bring their loved one back, it provided some measure of justice.\n\nThe case has sparked renewed debate about the experience requirements for new drivers and the need for stricter enforcement of speed limits, particularly in rural areas. Road safety advocates are calling for increased awareness campaigns targeting young drivers, emphasizing the dangers of speeding and reckless driving. The incident serves as a stark reminder of the potentially fatal consequences of irresponsible driving and the importance of adhering to traffic laws.\n"

    "prompt": "A 19th Century engine building used to pump water out of a Denbighshire mine is being restored.",
    "HWT": "Clive Engine House has stood unused for more than 120 years after serving Talargoch Mine in Dyserth until 1884. Now county archaeologists have secured funds to repair the building, which has been affected by weathering over the decades. It was opened to the public on Friday to show how work is progressing. Denbighshire council archaeologist Fiona Gale said: \"It was a fantastic, once in a lifetime opportunity to repair the building and bring it back into good order\". Built in 1860, the Cornish engine house was home to a steam cylinder which powered water extraction pumps. Lead extraction is thought to have taken place at Talargoch since the Roman period. It has also produced copper, silver and calamine, but it is most famous as a producer of lead and zinc ore. The engine house is one of the few remaining signs of what was once a large and important industry in the area. The engine was in operation until the mine closed in 1884 when the engine was sold to the former Westminster Colliery in Wrexham. David Thomas, the Denbighshire cabinet lead member for regeneration, said the building was a \"testament to the hard work of all those who worked in the lead mines in the area over many years\". Grants from funders WREN and Cadw are paying for repair work which is being co-ordinated by Denbighshire council.",
    "MGT": "Deep within the Denbighshire countryside, a significant piece of industrial heritage is undergoing a meticulous restoration, breathing new life into a 19th-century engine building that once served a vital role in the region's mining history. The structure, originally constructed to house a powerful steam engine, was instrumental in pumping water from the depths of a local mine, enabling the extraction of valuable resources.\n\nFor decades, the building stood as a silent sentinel, its purpose forgotten, its walls weathered by the passage of time. However, a dedicated team of conservationists and local historians has embarked on an ambitious project to restore the engine building to its former glory.\n\nThe restoration efforts are focused on preserving the building's unique architectural features, including its imposing brickwork, arched windows, and the remnants of the engine's foundations. Skilled craftsmen are employing traditional techniques and materials to repair damaged sections, ensuring the authenticity and longevity of the structure.\n\nThe restored engine building is envisioned as a valuable educational resource, offering visitors a glimpse into the region's industrial past. Interpretive displays will showcase the history of the mine, the workings of the steam engine, and the lives of the miners who toiled in its depths.\n\nThe project has garnered widespread support from the local community, with residents eager to see this historic landmark revitalized. It is hoped that the restored engine building will serve as a catalyst for further heritage tourism, attracting visitors to the area and boosting the local economy. As the restoration progresses, the building stands as a testament to the ingenuity and hard work of the generations who shaped the industrial landscape of Denbighshire.\n"

    "prompt": "An e-book at the centre of a row over who can use the term \"space marine\" is back on sale on the Amazon website.",
    "HWT": "The Spots the Space Marine story was taken off Amazon after model-soldier maker Games Workshop complained it infringed its trademark on the phrase. A blog post about the row by the story's US author, Maggie Hogarth, led to much criticism for Games Workshop. And digital rights group the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) said it had then helped Amazon \"review\" the case. In a statement about the row, the EFF said it was \"outrageous\" for Games Workshop to claim any rights over a term that had been in wide use in fiction since the 1930s. It said the case was an example of a growing trend, in which trademark and rights owners targeted the \"weakest link\" in the chain of people that helped content, be it fiction, movies or music, appear online. Often, said the EFF, the weakest link was an ISP, a hosting company or a website that acted as a store front or aggregator for many different creators. Such \"providers usually don't have the resources and/or the inclination to investigate trademark infringement claims\", it said. Many simply removed the disputed content immediately to stay \"neutral\" and avoid trouble, said the EFF, but that made it hard for those on the end of trademark claims to mount a challenge. The online chatter also prompted Games Workshop to put a statement about the row on its Facebook page, in which it said it had \"no choice\" but to act in cases where its trademarks in a commercially available product were being used without its consent. Despite this, it said, it had never claimed to have rights over the ways in which the terms \"warhammer\" or \"space marine\" were used in day-to-day speech. This everyday use also covered a \"body of prose\", it added. \"Trademarks as opposed to use of a word in prose or everyday language are two very different things,\" it said. \"Games Workshop is always vigilant in protecting the former, but never makes any claim to owning the latter.\"",
    "MGT": "An e-book embroiled in a trademark dispute over the use of the term \"space marine\" has reappeared for sale on Amazon. The novel, a science fiction title featuring heavily armored warriors in outer space, was temporarily removed from the platform following concerns raised regarding the alleged infringement of intellectual property rights.\n\nThe controversy surrounding the term \"space marine\" has been a long-standing one, primarily involving Games Workshop, the British company renowned for its Warhammer 40,000 tabletop game. Games Workshop has fiercely defended its trademark on \"space marine\" in various contexts, arguing that the term is inextricably linked to its fictional universe and that its unauthorized use could cause confusion among consumers.\n\nThe e-book's return to Amazon's digital shelves suggests that the legal or commercial issues that led to its initial removal have been resolved, at least temporarily. However, the precise nature of the resolution remains unclear. It is possible that an agreement has been reached between the author or publisher of the e-book and Games Workshop, or that Amazon has determined that the specific use of \"space marine\" in the novel does not constitute a significant infringement.\n\nThe debate over the ownership and permissible usage of common terms like \"space marine\" highlights the complex challenges faced by creators and intellectual property holders in the digital age. While trademark law aims to protect brands and prevent consumer deception, it also needs to be balanced against the principles of free expression and the potential for stifling creativity.\n\nThe case has sparked considerable discussion within the science fiction community, with many authors and fans expressing concern about the potential implications for independent creators who may wish to use familiar tropes and terminology in their work. Some argue that aggressively defending trademarks on widely used terms could lead to a chilling effect, discouraging innovation and limiting the range of stories that can be told.\n\nGames Workshop has maintained that its actions are necessary to protect its brand and prevent others from unfairly profiting from its intellectual property. The company has invested heavily in developing the Warhammer 40,000 universe and its associated trademarks, and it believes that it has a right to control how those trademarks are used.\n\nThe reappearance of the e-book on Amazon is unlikely to be the end of the story. The legal and commercial landscape surrounding trademark law is constantly evolving, and the debate over the use of \"space marine\" is likely to continue for some time to come. The outcome of this particular case could have significant implications for authors, publishers, and intellectual property holders across the science fiction genre and beyond.\n"

    "HWT": "It all started when the head of Israel's association of tour operators posted a photo of the bill, suggesting the visitors may have been \"suckered\". But the restaurant's owners contest this, and give a different version of how the meal unfolded. They say the group had a gourmet meal and the venue was closed to host them. The bill, from the popular Abu Ghosh restaurant on the outskirts of West Jerusalem, allegedly included 5,900 shekels in alcohol, 4,000 shekels for the use of the private room and 3,150 shekels for the main course. On top of what was consumed by the group, there was a service charge of 1,500 shekels. In a post on Facebook (in Hebrew) with a picture of the bill, Yossi Fatael, chairman of the Israel Incoming Tour Operators Association, said the group's tourist agent confirmed they had paid the bill. \"There may be a billion Chinese, but they may not all be suckers,\" he said. \"This is how we are destroying our own budding potential of the Chinese market in Israel.\" But Jawdat Ibrahim, one of Abu Ghosh's owners, disputed this. He said, also on Facebook (in Hebrew), the group had a gourmet meal that lasted for eight hours, with special desserts, specially ordered alcoholic drinks and artists - and that the restaurant was closed to the public to host them. He also said the eight had insisted on paying the service charge. The post had pictures of what he said was the specially produced decoration to host the group. The Chinese visitors have not been identified. Some 6,900 Chinese tourists visited Israel in July, according to the Central Bureau of Statistics.  In the same month, there were 57,000 tourists from the US and 31,600 from France.",
    "MGT": "A hefty restaurant bill presented to a group of Chinese tourists near Jerusalem has ignited a firestorm of controversy online, raising questions about potential overcharging and exploitation of tourists. The bill, totaling 16,500 shekels (approximately $4,393 or £3,285), was issued to eight individuals dining at the unnamed establishment.\n\nDetails surrounding the meal and the specific items ordered remain somewhat unclear, further fueling the online debate. Images of the bill, circulating widely across social media platforms, have drawn condemnation from users who deem the amount exorbitant and unjustified. Many commenters have expressed outrage, accusing the restaurant of taking advantage of the tourists' unfamiliarity with local prices.\n\nThe incident has prompted calls for greater transparency and regulation within the tourism industry to protect visitors from potential scams and unfair pricing practices. Some social media users have urged authorities to investigate the matter thoroughly and hold the restaurant accountable if wrongdoing is found.\n\nWhile specific details about the dishes consumed remain vague, the sheer size of the bill has raised eyebrows and prompted widespread speculation. Questions have been raised about whether the bill included hidden charges, inflated prices for certain items, or mandatory service fees that were not clearly disclosed.\n\nThe incident serves as a cautionary tale for tourists traveling abroad, highlighting the importance of being aware of local pricing norms and carefully reviewing bills before making payments. It also underscores the need for restaurants and other businesses catering to tourists to maintain ethical and transparent pricing practices.\n\nThe Ministry of Tourism has yet to release an official statement regarding the incident. However, the widespread attention the case has garnered online may prompt them to address the issue and take steps to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future. The reputation of Israel as a welcoming and fair tourist destination could be at stake.

    "HWT": "Cyprus was the only crisis-hit eurozone country to restrict capital transfers, as it faced a run on the banks. The controls were eased in January. There will no longer be a monthly cap of €20,000 (£15,000; $22,000) on transfers by individuals to foreign banks, or of €10,000 for travellers moving money out of the country. Cyprus received a €10bn bailout from the EU and International Monetary Fund (IMF) after its biggest banks nearly collapsed in March 2013 because of huge losses on their Greek investments. The island's second-biggest lender, Cyprus Popular Bank (also known as Laiki Bank), was wound up and deposits worth more than €100,000 in the largest bank, Bank of Cyprus, were seized. Those measures were part of the deal to ensure that Cyprus funded part of the €10bn bailout. Speaking on Friday, Cyprus President Nicos Anastasiades voiced confidence that the Mediterranean island was recovering well, despite three years of recession. Lifting capital controls, he said, was \"a vote of confidence in our banking system which, now fully independent of Greek banking institutions, can move forward\". The Greek debt crisis had a severe impact on Cypriot banks, which lost about €4.5bn worth of Greek sovereign bonds - equivalent to 25% of Cypriot gross domestic product, Reuters news agency reports.",
    "MGT": "Nicosia, Cyprus - Cyprus is set to fully lift the remaining capital controls that have been in place since the 2013 financial crisis, marking a significant milestone in the country's economic recovery. The restrictions, initially implemented to prevent a run on banks and stabilize the financial system, have been gradually eased over the past several years.\n\nThe decision to remove the final restrictions underscores the strengthened resilience of the Cypriot banking sector and the overall improvement in the economic climate. The controls were initially imposed in March 2013, as the country teetered on the brink of financial collapse, requiring a bailout from international lenders.\n\nThe restrictions limited the movement of funds both domestically and internationally, impacting businesses and individuals alike. The gradual easing of these measures began in 2015, as confidence in the banking system began to return.\n\nCypriot officials have credited the successful implementation of economic reforms and prudent fiscal policies for the country's return to financial stability. The lifting of capital controls is expected to further boost investor confidence and attract foreign investment, fostering sustainable economic growth.\n\nThe move is also seen as a positive signal to international markets, demonstrating Cyprus' commitment to transparency and adherence to international financial standards. While challenges remain, the complete removal of capital controls represents a symbolic end to a turbulent period in Cypriot history, paving the way for a more prosperous future.\n"

Two students were killed during protests last week. Nicolas Maduro's presidency has come under increasing pressure as the economy suffers and opponents accuse him of creating a dictatorship. Mr Maduro was pelted with objects by angry protesters as he left a military event in the south-eastern state of Bolivar earlier on Tuesday.

The dead teenager was identified as Brayan Principal by opposition MP Alfonso Marquina, who said he had been shot in the abdomen. A 36-year-old man was also killed in Barquisimeto in a separate incident, the state prosecution service said. Opposition leaders are calling for a date to be set for postponed regional elections.

Baxter's comments came after Exeter secured a home semi-final playoff berth, driven by an unprecedented run of eight consecutive bonus-point victories.\n\nWhile acknowledging the accomplishment as a testament to his team's hard work and determination, Baxter admitted to finding the situation \"scary.\" He elaborated that the fact Exeter required such a dominant winning streak to guarantee a home playoff fixture underscores the incredibly tight margins separating the top teams in the league.\n\n\"It's a fantastic achievement for the lads, no doubt about it,\" Baxter said. \"But when you start thinking about the bigger picture, the reality is it's pretty scary that you have to put together that kind of run just to get yourselves in a position where you're playing at home in a semi-final.\"\n\nBaxter emphasized the need for continuous improvement and adaptation in the face of rising competition. He noted that other teams have invested heavily in their squads, and tactical innovations are becoming increasingly prevalent. This has resulted in a league where any slip-up can prove costly.\n\nThe Exeter Chiefs now await their semi-final opponent, knowing that they will need to maintain their high level of performance to secure a place in the final. Baxter's remarks serve as a reminder of the relentless pressure and high stakes that define the Gallagher Premiership.\n"

    "HWT": "Finalists New England Patriots used under-inflated balls in their victory over Indianapolis Colts. Referee chief Dean Blandino said 108 balls will be used as the Patriots take on Seattle Seahawks in Arizona. \"There will be some added security just because of the environment we're in for this game,\" said Blandino. During a regular game, each team has 12 balls which are given to the officials before the game to be inspected. But in the Super Bowl, because some of the footballs are later given to charity, each team has 54. All of the balls will be taken into custody by the NFL on Friday after the Seattle Seahawks and New England Patriots have prepared them. The footballs will be inspected by referee Bill Vinkovich three hours before the game, which takes place at the University of Phoenix Stadium. Blandino said the inspection of the footballs by referee Walt Anderson before New England's 45-7 win over the Colts was handled properly and the officiating is \"not part of the investigation\". \"Everything was properly tested and marked before the game,\" added Blandino. \"Walt gauged the footballs himself. It is something he has done throughout his career.\"",
    "MGT": "In the wake of the ongoing investigation into under-inflated footballs, the NFL has announced heightened security measures surrounding the footballs used in Sunday's Super Bowl.\n\nLeague officials confirmed that the footballs will be subject to increased scrutiny and a more rigorous chain of custody protocol than in previous years. This decision comes after allegations surfaced that the New England Patriots used under-inflated footballs during the AFC Championship game, a controversy now widely known as \"Deflategate.\"\n\nThe NFL has yet to conclude its investigation into the matter, but the league is clearly taking steps to ensure the integrity of the game remains uncompromised. Sources familiar with the new protocols indicate that each football will be meticulously inspected and measured for proper inflation levels before the game. These measurements will be documented and verified by multiple officials.\n\nFurthermore, the footballs will be closely monitored throughout the game, with increased security personnel assigned to oversee their handling. Any deviation from the established protocol will be immediately addressed and investigated. The NFL hopes that these measures will reassure fans and players alike that the Super Bowl will be played fairly and under the strictest standards. The league aims to prevent any further questions or concerns regarding the legitimacy of the game's outcome.\n"

    "HWT": "The 21-month-old from Sheffield went missing during a family holiday in 1991. Following a suggestion he may have been killed and buried on the island a fresh excavation of farmland began on Monday. The four or five graves are believed to date from 1,500 years ago but police said the discovery would not hamper the investigation. Forensic archaeologists have said they are confident the search is being conducted at exactly the right depth of soil relevant to 25 years ago. The digging has concentrated on an area around a waste tank. Nutrients found in the soil have indicated human traces and a full analysis of soil samples will be carried out. Officers have said they believe the material will most likely relate to a nearby cess tank. Danny Savage, BBC correspondent in Kos The graves found in Kos are all believed to contain the remains of adults. They are lying head to toe close to the boundary of the olive grove where the dig is taking place. Work will continue around them and police said the ancient discovery was not unexpected. There was initial concern from Greek locals that this would have hindered progress at the site but I have been told by the investigating team here in Kos that is not the case. The site being searched is on land where Ben was last seen playing while his grandfather was renovating a property 25 years ago. The Needham family have always believed Ben was abducted but South Yorkshire Police are now investigating whether he was accidentally run over and killed by a bulldozer.",

Detectives, acting on new information, have been excavating land near the farmhouse where Ben was last seen.\n\nWhile the primary focus remains finding answers about Ben's disappearance, the discovery of the graves has added a layer of complexity to the investigation. Archaeologists have been called in to carefully examine the site and determine the age and origin of the remains.\n\n\"We are aware of the discovery of potential historical artifacts during the search for Ben Needham,\" stated a police spokesperson. \"We are working closely with archaeological experts to ensure that any historical finds are properly documented and preserved.

The area around the graves has been cordoned off, and forensic experts are assisting in the delicate process of excavation.\n\nBen Needham was just 21 months old when he vanished while his grandparents were renovating a farmhouse on Kos. Despite numerous leads and extensive searches over the years, no trace of the toddler has ever been found.\n\nRecent information prompted a renewed search of the area, with investigators focusing on a specific plot of land.

Statistics South Africa released the figures, revealing a concerning slowdown across several key sectors.\n\nThe contraction is attributed to a slump in mining and manufacturing output, alongside disruptions in energy supply and logistical challenges. Load shedding, the term for scheduled power cuts, continues to plague businesses and households, hindering productivity and economic activity.\n\nAnalysts warn that the weak start to the year raises concerns about the country's overall economic growth prospects. The South African Reserve Bank had projected a modest recovery for 2024, but the latest figures suggest that the target may be difficult to achieve.\n\nThe government faces mounting pressure to implement reforms that will stimulate growth and attract investment. Efforts to address energy shortages and improve infrastructure are seen as crucial to reversing the current economic trajectory.\n\nThe slowdown could also have implications for employment, with businesses potentially scaling back operations in response to reduced demand. The unemployment rate remains stubbornly high, exacerbating social and economic challenges.\n"

Crusaders replied through Michael Carvill, Paul Heatley and an Aaron Smyth own goal but sub Ben Roy's 87th minute finish sealed the surprise win. Josh Robinson of Crusaders and Carrick boss Gary Haveron got late red cards. Crusaders remain five points ahead of second-placed Linfield. Defender Robinson received the red card for a crunching touchline challenge on home striker Roy. It sparked ugly scenes as players and management clashed on the side of the pitch. Rangers manager Haveron was sent to the stand for his part in the unseemly scuffle. However, the Carrick boss will have been pleased with his side as they move above Ballinamallard and into 10th place in the relegation battle. They had lost their last 13 matches against the Crues, but raced into an early lead thanks to a curling Kelly effort. Salley doubled their advantage on 29 minutes when he rifled the ball past keeper Sean O'Neill. It was the youngster's second goal since joining Rangers on loan from Linfield in January. Salley then turned provider for Carrick's third, beating Colin Coates before teeing up Harmon for a simple finish before the break. Crusaders hit back with Carvill pouncing early in the second half and, when Heatley pounced on a poor kick-out by keeper Brian Neeson to make it 3-2, the comeback looked on.

Goals from Britt Assombalonga and Nathaniel Mendez-Laing were enough to see off the League One rivals in a tightly contested first-round encounter.\n\nThe match began with both sides displaying attacking intent, but it was Peterborough who gradually asserted their dominance. Assombalonga, leading the line with his characteristic physicality, proved a constant threat to the Exeter defense. His tireless running and intelligent movement eventually paid dividends midway through the first half. A well-weighted through ball found Assombalonga in space, and the striker calmly slotted the ball past the advancing Exeter goalkeeper, giving the Posh a crucial lead.\n\nExeter, however, refused to capitulate. They responded with renewed vigor, pressing higher up the pitch and creating several nervy moments for the Peterborough backline. Their midfield began to exert greater control, dictating the tempo of the game and probing for weaknesses in the Posh defense. Despite their efforts, they were unable to find a breakthrough before the halftime whistle.\n\nThe second half saw Exeter continue to push for an equalizer. They introduced fresh legs in attack, hoping to inject pace and creativity into their forward play. However, Peterborough remained resolute, defending deep and compact, denying Exeter any clear-cut opportunities.\n\nAs the game wore on, Peterborough looked increasingly dangerous on the counter-attack. The introduction of Mendez-Laing added another dimension to their attacking play, his pace and trickery causing problems for the Exeter defenders. It was Mendez-Laing who eventually sealed the victory for Peterborough, latching onto a loose ball on the edge of the box and unleashing a powerful shot that found the bottom corner of the net.\n\nThe goal sparked jubilant celebrations among the Peterborough faithful, who knew that their team had secured passage to the next round of the FA Cup. Exeter continued to battle until the final whistle, but they were unable to breach the Peterborough defense, leaving the home side to celebrate a well-deserved victory.\n\nThe win provides a significant boost for Peterborough, who can now look forward to the second round draw with anticipation.

    "HWT": "It indicates average day school fees are now £13,194 per year and boarding fees cost an average of £30,369. Private schooling from primary age to A-levels totals £286,000 for a day place and £468,000 for a boarder, the report from Killik and Co finds. London remains the most expensive region, with an average day school place costing £15,500 per year. The north of England and Scotland were the cheapest, at £10,400 and £10,700 respectively. In a survey of 250 parents who privately educate their children, over a third (37.2%) said they saw private education as an \"investment priority\". Of those surveyed, 34% said the attraction of smaller class sizes was a major consideration. Almost a quarter said they sent their children to private school for \"the connections my children will get\" (24.8%). Another main reason was that \"either myself or a member of my family went there\" (18%). Sarah Lord, managing director of Killik financial planners, said: \"The cost of private education is eye-watering for many families. However, over a third of parents responded that investment in education is one of the best investments they can make. \"Of course, private education is not going to be viable for everybody. For some, it will make much more sense to opt for a good state school and invest the money elsewhere. \"Indeed, 14 years of day school fees from 2015 could be invested over this time to build a potential sum of around £800,000, which would help children later on in life, whether that be funding university, buying a house, or securing a comfortable retirement.\"",
    "MGT": "A new study has revealed the staggering cost of providing a child with a private education in the United Kingdom. According to the research, parents can expect to pay an average of £286,000 to send their child to private school from pre-prep through to the end of secondary school, a period of approximately 14 years.\n\nThe figure encompasses tuition fees, which form the bulk of the expense, as well as additional costs such as school uniforms, textbooks, extracurricular activities, and school trips. The research takes into account regional variations in school fees, with London and the South East typically commanding higher prices than other parts of the country.\n\nThe findings highlight the significant financial commitment required for parents to opt for private education. While state-funded schools offer free education, private schools often boast smaller class sizes, specialized facilities, and a broader range of academic and extracurricular opportunities. This perceived advantage comes at a substantial price.\n\nExperts suggest that the rising cost of living, coupled with increasing school fees, is putting pressure on families considering private education. Many parents are forced to make significant financial sacrifices, such as downsizing their homes or postponing retirement, to afford the fees. Others rely on family support or explore alternative funding options, such as scholarships and bursaries.\n\nThe debate over private education remains a contentious one. Proponents argue that it provides children with a superior education and better opportunities for future success, while critics contend that it exacerbates social inequality and creates a two-tiered education system.\n\nRegardless of the viewpoint, the research serves as a stark reminder of the financial burden associated with private education in the UK. As school fees continue to rise, parents face an increasingly difficult decision when choosing the best educational path for their children. The study underscores the importance of careful financial planning and consideration of all available options.\n"

The celebration will bring together some of the machine's creators and operators at The National Museum of Computing (TNMOC). The machine's code-cracking prowess will be demonstrated on the day using the museum's rebuilt Colossus. Now widely recognised as the first electronic computer, Colossus was kept a secret for 30 years because of the sensitive work it did during World War Two to crack German codes. The work of the Colossus machines to decipher messages scrambled using the Lorenz enciphering machine that passed between the Wehrmacht's commanders is widely thought to have shortened the war and saved countless lives. Colossus was created by Post Office engineer Tommy Flowers, and his first prototype was built out of parts from telephone exchanges including 1,600 valves. Later versions used even more valves and by the end of the war 10 of the machines were in use in the UK. The celebrations will bring together some of the women who kept the different machines running as well as some of the engineers who built and maintained them. During wartime, about 550 people worked in the Bletchley Park unit that ran Colossus. Also attending will be some of the children of the machine's creators and operators. Most of the machines were broken up and the plans destroyed after the war in an attempt to keep the work secret and to conceal the fact Britain was still using two of the machines to read Soviet messages. \"The achievements of those who worked at Bletchley Park are humbling,\" said Tim Reynolds, chair of TNMOC. \"This day is in honour of all the men and women who worked on breaking the Lorenz cipher.\"",
    "MGT": "Bletchley Park, the historic home of British codebreaking during World War II, is commemorating the 70th anniversary of the Colossus computer, a machine that played a pivotal role in shortening the war. A gathering of historians, engineers, and veterans took place at the site to celebrate the groundbreaking technology and its impact on Allied victory.\n\nColossus, designed by Tommy Flowers and his team at the Post Office Research Station, was the world's first programmable, electronic digital computer. Its primary function was to decipher encrypted messages transmitted by the German High Command using the Lorenz cipher machine, known to the British as \"Tunny.\"\n\nThe existence of Colossus was kept secret for decades after the war, contributing to the relative obscurity of its creators. Unlike its American counterpart, ENIAC, Colossus was purpose-built for codebreaking, and its existence was classified due to the sensitive nature of intelligence gathering.\n\nDuring the war, ten Colossus machines were built, each an improvement on the last. These machines significantly reduced the time it took to break German codes, providing vital intelligence to Allied forces. Information gleaned from intercepted messages influenced strategic decisions and contributed to key victories, including the D-Day landings.\n\nThe reconstruction of a working Colossus at Bletchley Park has allowed visitors to witness the scale and complexity of the machine. The ongoing efforts to preserve the history of Colossus highlight its importance in the development of modern computing. The anniversary celebration serves as a reminder of the ingenuity and dedication of the individuals who worked in secret to break the enemy's codes. Their contributions not only helped to win the war but also laid the foundation for the digital age we live in today. The legacy of Colossus continues to inspire innovation and technological advancement.\n"

    "HWT": "Ryan Lock, 20, from Chichester in West Sussex, died fighting alongside Kurdish forces near Raqqa on 21 December. It is believed he turned a gun on himself to avoid being taken hostage. Dozens of people, including members of the Kurdish community, held roses and framed pictures of him, as his coffin arrived at Heathrow Airport. The former chef, who had no previous military experience, joined the Kurdish armed fighting forces, the YPG, after telling his family he was going on holiday to Turkey in August. The YPG told the BBC that \"trace of a gunshot wound was found under the chin\", suggesting suicide. Staff at Heathrow were rather caught off guard as Ryan Lock's body arrived home. No-one at the cargo bay of Royal Jordanian Airlines expected to see a crowd of mourners arriving on their forecourt. With just a couple of hours notice, Kurds young and old turned out to pay tribute to a man from Chichester whom they had never met. \"This is not just a foreign war, this is a fight for humanity\", one told me. \"International solidarity\" they chant as they place flowers over the private ambulance carrying Ryan Lock's coffin. They hold their hands up in silent salute. To have a British man fight their cause, touches their hearts. A Kurdish mother kisses the ambulance and weeps as it drives away. Supporters of the YPJ female-fighting force paid tribute to Mr Lock, saying his memory would \"forever live on in our struggle for the freedom of Syria and our hope for change in the whole world\". YPG general command member Mihyedin Xirki had previously said Mr Lock was a \"martyr\" who died \"putting up a brave fight\". The volunteer, who attended school in Havant, Hampshire, became the third British man to die fighting alongside the Kurds against so-called Islamic State. The Foreign Office continues to advise against all travel to Syria.",
    "MGT": "The remains of a British man who traveled to Syria to combat the Islamic State have been repatriated to the United Kingdom, where they were received with honors. The individual, whose identity has not been officially released, is understood to have joined Kurdish forces in their fight against the extremist group.\n\nDetails surrounding the circumstances of his death remain scarce, but sources suggest he was killed in action during clashes with ISIS fighters. He is believed to have travelled to the region independently, motivated by a desire to assist in the struggle against the terrorist organization.\n\nUpon arrival at an undisclosed location in the UK, the body was met by family members, friends, and representatives from various organizations involved in supporting those who fought against ISIS. A private ceremony was held to commemorate his sacrifice.\n\nThe return of the deceased has sparked a mix of emotions across the country. While some mourn the loss of a brave individual who risked his life to defend others, others express concern over the potential implications of Britons traveling to conflict zones.\n\nThe British government has consistently advised against travel to Syria, citing the extreme danger and instability in the region. However, a number of individuals, motivated by a variety of factors, have chosen to ignore this advice and join the fight against ISIS.\n\nThe individual's actions have reignited the debate about the role of foreign fighters in the Syrian conflict. Some argue that they are essential in bolstering the efforts of local forces against ISIS, while others fear that their involvement could further complicate the situation and potentially lead to radicalization.\n\nThe homecoming of this fallen fighter serves as a stark reminder of the ongoing struggle against ISIS and the sacrifices made by those who have chosen to confront the group on the battlefield. His name will undoubtedly be added to the list of those who have lost their lives in the fight against extremism. The legacy of his actions will continue to be debated and analyzed for years to come.\n"

    "HWT": "The Royal College of Midwives (RCM) and Public Heath Wales stressed the dangers of flu to pregnant women and reminded expectant mothers to get vaccinated. Pregnant women are more vulnerable to infections and cannot fight off flu as well as other people. Dr Richard Roberts, of Public Health Wales, said there can be \"severe complications\" for mothers and babies. Pregnant women who catch flu are more likely to deliver early, with an increased risk of stillbirth or illness for a baby in their first week. Helen Rogers, director of RCM, said it \"strongly recommends\" pregnant women have the vaccination, saying they can have it \"at any stage during their pregnancy\". \"We also urge midwives and other health professionals to have the vaccination to protect themselves, their family and the people they care for from infection as well,\" she added. Dr Richard Roberts, head of the vaccine preventable disease programme at Public Health Wales, said flu can be \"devastating for the woman and her unborn baby\". The annual flu vaccination programme aims to make sure the people who need it most get free protection each year, including those aged 65 and over and people with certain long-term health conditions, as well as pregnant women. All children aged two and three years old on 31 August 2016, and those in reception class, year one, two and three in school are also being offered protection with a nasal spray flu vaccine. Two and three-year-olds will get their spray at GP surgeries, while those up to year three will be offered the vaccine at school.",
    "MGT": "Health bodies across Wales are strongly urging pregnant women to receive a free flu vaccination this winter to protect themselves and their unborn babies. Experts emphasize that pregnant women are at a higher risk of developing serious complications from influenza, making vaccination a critical preventative measure.\n\nThe flu can lead to pneumonia, premature labor, and even hospitalization in pregnant women. Furthermore, getting vaccinated during pregnancy provides passive immunity to the newborn, offering protection in the first few months of life when they are too young to be vaccinated themselves.\n\nDespite the clear benefits, uptake rates among pregnant women in Wales remain lower than desired. Health officials are actively working to raise awareness about the safety and effectiveness of the flu vaccine during pregnancy. They are reassuring expectant mothers that the vaccine is safe for both them and their developing baby.\n\nThe flu vaccine is readily available free of charge to pregnant women through their GP, midwife, or participating pharmacies. Appointments are quick and convenient, requiring minimal disruption to daily routines.\n\nHealthcare professionals are encouraged to proactively offer the flu vaccine to all pregnant patients and address any concerns they may have. By increasing vaccination rates, Wales can better protect its pregnant population and ensure healthier outcomes for both mothers and their newborns during the winter months. This collective effort will contribute to a healthier and safer start for families across the nation.\n"

Juan Zuniga and Nordin Amrabat have joined Watford's lengthy injury list after suffering ankle and leg injuries respectively on Sunday.

Some of the other muppets in the collection include early versions of Cookie Monster and Oscar the Grouch. Henson's oldest puppet, Pierre the French Rat, was also donated. Jane Henson said the original characters provided five minutes of fun each night after the local news where they mostly mimed to popular music. \"I think people realized that if you put Kermit's face up there, it was just as powerful - we were mostly just doing it to entertain ourselves,\" she said. The Smithsonian already has a familiar Kermit the Frog puppet made famous on Sesame Street and The Muppet Show. But the original Kermit looked more like a lizard, made with ping-pong ball eyes and green felt from an old coat thrown out by Henson's mother. Museum curator Dwight Blocker Bowers said the muppets would be a boon for the museum's collection. \"It certainly shows the muppets at the beginning of the career of a large family of entertainers,\" he said. \"More than anything, I think it shows the genius of Jim Henson.\" Bowers said the museum plans to have the original muppets on display by November in the pop culture gallery.

He first emerged from Henson's creative mind in 1955, a humble creation fashioned from a discarded coat and ping pong balls. Over the years, Kermit evolved from a simple frog-like creature into a complex and beloved character, becoming the face of the Muppets and a symbol of joyful entertainment for audiences worldwide.\n\nThe Smithsonian's acquisition of the original Kermit puppet underscores the enduring impact of Jim Henson's work and the profound influence of the Muppets on American culture.

    "HWT": "Educating is back for a fourth series aiming to show real life in schools using a fly on the wall format. The last three series have been praised for showing an insight into what education is like in Britain. But there's also been criticism they focussed too much on bullying, bad language and teen pregnancies. As someone who was once a teacher (all be it a substitute) I can tell you there is just as much bad language in a staff room as there is in the common room. But try not offending someone in 2014. With that in mind the producers have planned a fourth series and to tick another regional box they've decided to head to Wales for the first time. The location will be Willows High School in Cardiff where the head teacher has said she's simply \"delighted\" that the programme will be showing off their high standards. Over the last few years the school has become one of the most improving schools in Wales. Head teacher Joy Ballard said: \"Willows has been on an incredible journey over the past three years and has been transformed from one of the worst performing schools in the country to a school that we are very proud of.\" The nine-episode series will air in autumn. Executive producer at Channel 4 David Clews said: \"You can really feel the charm and character of the place as soon as you walk through the gates and start talking to the students. \"We really are excited about making Educating in Wales.\" Channel 4 has been pumping millions of pounds into it's documentary making in the last few years and the Educating series has certainly been a success.

Producers are expected to immerse themselves in the diverse communities that make up the city, from the bustling city center to the quieter suburbs.\n\nWhile specific details about the individuals and stories that will be featured remain under wraps, the series is anticipated to touch upon a range of themes relevant to contemporary Cardiff. These could include the city's ongoing regeneration, its cultural identity in the face of increasing globalization, and the experiences of its diverse population.\n\nThe choice of Cardiff as the next location reflects Channel 4's commitment to showcasing different perspectives from across the UK. Previous series have garnered both critical acclaim and significant viewership, sparking conversations about social issues and regional identities. The \"Educating Essex\" series, for example, offered a raw and honest look at the challenges and triumphs of a secondary school in the county.\n\nSimilarly, \"Educating Yorkshire\" provided an intimate glimpse into the lives of students and teachers in a northern school. Most recently, \"East London\" explored the realities of life in one of the capital's most dynamic and rapidly changing areas.\n\nThe Cardiff series is expected to follow a similar format, offering viewers an unvarnished and authentic portrait of the city.

    "HWT": "Where can you have a day out for less than £25? The BBC's Price of Football study has analysed data from 223 clubs across Britain and Europe to find out how much is costs supporters to follow their team. Overall, 36% of ticket prices in the division went up compared to last year's study - the biggest percentage increase across the men's leagues in the UK. The average cost of the cheapest matchday ticket has gone up to £22.11 - a six-year high - while the most expensive matchday tickets average £36.13. The average season ticket prices are at their lowest since 2013 - with the cheapest averaging £322.83 and the most expensive averaging £568.15. A £30 away ticket cap was introduced in the Premier League at the start of the season, in the same year that a record £8bn TV rights deal came into effect. With no cap in the Championship, the average price of the most expensive away ticket is £31.57 - more than £2 dearer than the top flight. However, the average in the cheapest away ticket category has fallen by 9% to £20.98 since last year. Twelve Championship clubs offer away tickets for more than £30: Aston Villa, Barnsley, Brentford, Brighton, Derby, Ipswich, Leeds, Newcastle Norwich, Nottingham Forest, QPR and Sheffield Wednesday.",
    "MGT": "Several Championship clubs are charging away fans more for tickets than some Premier League teams, raising questions about affordability and fairness for travelling supporters. An investigation reveals discrepancies in pricing, with some second-tier clubs demanding upwards of £30 for an away ticket, exceeding the price caps implemented by many Premier League teams.\n\nWhile the Premier League enforces a £30 cap on away ticket prices, no such regulation exists in the Championship. This allows clubs to set their own prices, often resulting in significant variations across the league. Some Championship clubs argue that higher prices are necessary to offset operational costs and maintain competitive squads. However, fan groups argue that these prices are exploitative and discourage away support, which is vital for creating atmosphere and generating revenue for both home and away teams.\n\nThe financial disparity between the Premier League and the Championship contributes to the issue. Premier League clubs benefit from lucrative broadcasting deals, allowing them to absorb the cost of subsidized away tickets. Championship clubs, with less financial security, rely more heavily on matchday revenue, potentially leading to higher ticket prices.\n\nThe lack of a price cap in the Championship has sparked debate among fans, clubs, and governing bodies. Supporters are calling for greater transparency and regulation to ensure fair and affordable access to away games. The issue highlights the challenges faced by Championship clubs in balancing financial sustainability with the need to maintain strong relationships with their fanbase. Further discussions are anticipated to explore potential solutions, including a league-wide agreement on away ticket pricing or increased financial support for clubs to help offset the cost of reduced ticket prices.\n"

    "HWT": "Two nightclub owners and two members of the band playing as the fire began are accused of \"negligent homicide\". A police inquiry in the city of Santa Maria found that the fire was triggered by fireworks used by the band. Most of the victims died after inhaling the toxic smoke produced when ceiling insulation foam caught fire. Investigators also criticised the fact that the venue only had one exit. The police investigation identified 16 potential accused, of which eight have been charged. Four people were charged earlier for obstructing the course of justice, including two firemen accused of hiding evidence that the club's fire licence had expired. Nightclub owners Mauro Hoffmann and Elissandro Spohr and two members of the Gurizada Fandangueira band, Marcelo de Jesus dos Santos and Luciano Bonilha Leao, face trial for manslaughter. Prosecutor Joel Dutra said the four men knew of the possible impact of their actions and failed to act. \"To die through the inhalation of toxic fumes is a cruel way of dying,\" he said. \"The reason they died was the search for profit, through the use of inadequate fireworks and highly inflammable foam on the nightclub's ceiling.\" The police report published in March said dozens of eyewitnesses reported seeing the singer on stage holding the firework which triggered the blaze. Attempts by the singer and a security guard to extinguish the fire failed when the extinguisher they used did not work, the witnesses said. Many said that the security guards at the club at first tried to stop people from leaving the club, which was found to be overcrowded.

The band members facing charges are the vocalist Marcelo de Jesus dos Santos and the stage technician Luciano Bonilha Leão.\n\nProsecutors allege that the nightclub owners were negligent in their operation of the establishment, citing the use of highly flammable soundproofing material, the lack of adequate fire safety equipment, and overcrowding as contributing factors to the disaster. The charges against the band members stem from the use of pyrotechnics during their performance, which is believed to have ignited the flammable material on the ceiling, triggering the rapid spread of the fire.\n\nThe charges carry a potential sentence of several years in prison. The legal proceedings are expected to be lengthy and complex, involving numerous witnesses, expert testimonies, and meticulous examination of evidence.\n\nThe Kiss nightclub fire has brought immense grief and suffering to the families and friends of the victims, as well as the broader community of Santa Maria. The tragedy has also sparked widespread outrage and calls for stricter enforcement of safety regulations in entertainment venues across Brazil.\n\nIn the aftermath of the fire, authorities have conducted thorough inspections of nightclubs and other public spaces, resulting in the closure of numerous establishments found to be in violation of safety standards. The incident has served as a stark reminder of the importance of prioritizing public safety and ensuring that businesses adhere to all applicable regulations.\n\nThe legal proceedings are being closely monitored by the victims' families and the public, who are seeking justice and accountability for the tragic loss of life. The trial is expected to shed light on the circumstances surrounding the fire and the failures that contributed to its devastating consequences.

People who suffer from chronic conditions such as asthma, heart problems, diabetes, kidney or liver disease are at risk of serious complications from flu, and are offered the vaccination by the NHS. However, 48% of those with pre-existing health conditions eligible for the jab have not received it. Meanwhile 54% of pregnant mothers have not had the free vaccine. Public health minister Maureen Watt said: \"It is important that those who are eligible for the flu vaccination make an appointment as soon as possible to protect their health. \"Flu is a serious illness and each year the winter months present an increase in the number of cases requiring hospital treatment. \"Flu can cause severe health complications, and the best way to protect yourself and help prevent spread of the virus is to get vaccinated.\" Appealing to those who have not yet had the jab, she added: \"It only takes a few minutes, and even if you were immunised against flu last winter it is important to receive the vaccine again, as the viruses change each season.\"",
    "MGT": "Health officials in Scotland are urging residents to get vaccinated against influenza following a concerning increase in hospitalizations due to the virus. The call to action comes as hospitals across the country are experiencing heightened pressure, with a significant number of flu patients requiring serious medical attention.\n\nPublic Health Scotland has expressed concern over the recent surge, emphasizing that vaccination remains the most effective way to protect individuals and reduce the strain on healthcare services. Experts highlight that the flu virus can cause severe complications, particularly for vulnerable groups such as the elderly, young children, pregnant women, and those with underlying health conditions.\n\nThe current flu season is proving to be more challenging than previous years, prompting health professionals to reiterate the importance of preventative measures. Alongside vaccination, individuals are advised to practice good hygiene, including frequent handwashing and covering coughs and sneezes, to minimize the spread of the virus.\n\nHealth boards throughout Scotland are actively promoting flu vaccination clinics and urging eligible individuals to book appointments as soon as possible. The vaccine is readily available through GPs and pharmacies, ensuring accessibility for the majority of the population.\n\nOfficials are also reminding the public that while the flu vaccine offers significant protection, it is not a guarantee against infection. However, vaccinated individuals who do contract the virus are likely to experience milder symptoms and a reduced risk of severe complications.\n\nThe appeal for increased vaccination uptake is part of a broader effort to safeguard public health and alleviate the burden on the National Health Service during the winter months. Health officials are closely monitoring the situation and will continue to provide updates and guidance as the flu season progresses.\n"

Mr Smith said it would \"conserve and exhibit two internationally-significant fossil marine reptiles\". The museum is currently looking for matched funding to complete the project.",
    "MGT": "Oxford's Museum of Natural History is poised to acquire and display a rare long-necked plesiosaur skeleton, thanks to a successful grant application. The museum plans to feature the fossil prominently, offering the public a unique glimpse into prehistoric marine life. Plesiosaurs, ancient marine reptiles with elongated necks and powerful flippers, roamed the Earth during the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods. This particular specimen is exceptionally well-preserved, making it a valuable addition to the museum's collection. Curators anticipate significant public interest in the exhibit, hoping it will inspire a new generation of paleontologists and educate visitors about the planet's rich history. Preparations are underway to integrate the plesiosaur into the museum's existing displays.\n"

The animals are now in the care of wildlife officials. Only six subspecies of tiger remain in the wild, with fewer than 1,000 tigers thought to be left in each group. Earlier this year, heads of police and customs from 13 countries with wild tiger populations agreed to tighten controls and improve cross-border co-operation to combat smuggling.",

The vehicle was stopped at a checkpoint in Mukdahan province, near the border with Laos. Officials became suspicious during a routine inspection and subsequently uncovered the caged cubs, all believed to be between one and two months old.\n\nThe driver, whose name has been withheld pending further investigation, claimed he was unaware of the contents of his cargo. He stated he was hired to transport the load across the border, but did not know what it contained. Authorities are currently investigating the driver's claims and working to determine the origin and intended destination of the tiger cubs.\n\nWildlife trafficking is a persistent problem in Southeast Asia, fueled by demand for exotic pets and traditional medicine. The tiger cubs are currently being cared for at a wildlife rescue center, where they are receiving necessary medical attention and nourishment.

Cooper shared that she often relays snippets of reviews, both positive and negative, highlighting aspects of his game that caught the attention of pundits and fans alike. He chuckled as he described her enthusiasm, stating that she sometimes has a better grasp of the external perception of his performance than he does.\n\nWhile Cooper appreciates his mother's unwavering support and dedication, he maintains a healthy distance from the constant scrutiny of public opinion. He believes that overanalyzing reviews can be detrimental to his mental state and hinder his ability to focus on improving his game. Instead, he relies on his own judgment and the guidance of his coaches to identify areas for development.\n\nCooper's revelation offers a glimpse into the personal lives of professional athletes and the unique roles their families play in navigating the pressures of the sport.

    "HWT": "Mr Amadou was arrested in November 2015 for baby-trafficking charges after fleeing to France for a year. He filed for provisional release to run in the elections but Judge Ibrahim Harouna denied the appeal on Monday. Mr Amadou says the accusations against him are politically motivated. The Constitutional Court on Saturday approved him to stand in elections. The court of appeals did not give a reason for the verdict. Mr Amadou's second wife was arrested in June 2014 along with 16 others, accused of illegally buying new-borns from \"baby factories\" in south-east Nigeria - where babies are allegedly sold for thousands of dollars. All denied any wrongdoing. Mr Amadou - a leading opposition presidential candidate - was then arrested in November 2015 after living in exile in France. Mr Amadou's supporters say the charges were fabricated to prevent him from running against President Mahamadou Issouffou in the 21 February presidential election. \"With this rejection of conditional release, the regime succeeded with its first knock-out blow,\" his lawyer, Souley Oumara, said. The BBC's Abdourahmane Dia says that Mr Amadou now has five days to appeal against the decision - or risk following the election from his prison cell. Tensions have been rising in Niger ahead of the elections. On Monday, lawyers in the country staged a 24-hour strike to oppose what they call the arbitrary arrest of government opponents. In December, President Mahamadou Issoufou said his government had foiled a plot to overthrow him. He is the favourite to win elections, though critics accuse him of becoming increasingly authoritarian as the vote nears. The campaign for the presidential election is due to start on 31 January, with 15 candidates vying for the presidency.",
    "MGT": "NIAMEY - Niger's Court of Appeals has ruled against the release of Hama Amadou, the former speaker of parliament, preventing him from campaigning in the upcoming elections. Amadou, a prominent opposition figure, has been incarcerated since November on charges he and his supporters claim are politically motivated.\n\nThe court's decision effectively sidelines one of President Mohamed Bazoum's main rivals just weeks before the crucial vote. Amadou's legal team argued vehemently for his temporary release, citing his constitutional right to participate in the democratic process and to address his constituents directly. They presented guarantees that he would return to custody after campaigning.\n\nHowever, the prosecution successfully countered that releasing Amadou would pose a significant risk to public order, given his influence and the potential for unrest. They emphasized the seriousness of the charges against him, without elaborating on the specifics.\n\nThe ruling has sparked outrage among Amadou's supporters and opposition parties, who accuse the government of using the judiciary to silence dissent and manipulate the electoral playing field. Critics argue that denying Amadou the opportunity to campaign undermines the integrity of the elections and casts a shadow over the democratic credentials of Niger.\n\nThe government has defended the court's independence, insisting that the decision was based solely on legal considerations and not political interference. They have repeatedly stated their commitment to ensuring free and fair elections, despite the controversy surrounding Amadou's detention.\n\nThe political climate in Niger remains tense, with the opposition threatening protests and civil disobedience in response to Amadou's continued imprisonment. International observers are closely monitoring the situation, urging all parties to uphold the rule of law and ensure a transparent and credible electoral process. The upcoming elections are seen as a critical test for Niger's democracy, and the controversy surrounding Amadou's case has only heightened the stakes.\n"

He has been helping defend Christians resisting government orders to remove crosses from buildings. China says it guarantees religious freedom but there are concerns about a crackdown on Christian activities. On Friday a pastor was jailed for refusing to remove a cross from his church's roof. The authorities have justified the tearing down of crosses by saying they break planning rules. Zhang Kai was arrested last year shortly before a planned meeting with the US envoy on religious freedoms. In the broadcast, Mr Zhang said he had assisted the Christians because he wanted wealth and fame. \"I really regret doing these things, I feel very remorseful,\" he said. \"These things violated China's law and violated my personal integrity as a lawyer, and they harmed societal structure and national security.\" China frequently airs confessions from high-profile suspects on television.

They emphasized that individuals should have the right to legal representation and due process, free from political interference.\n\nThe U.S. government has consistently advocated for human rights and the rule of law in China, raising concerns about the treatment of lawyers, activists, and other individuals who challenge the government's policies. This latest incident has further strained relations between the two countries.\n\nCritics argue that such televised confessions are a common tactic used by the Chinese government to discredit dissidents and silence dissenting voices. They claim that these confessions are often obtained through pressure or torture, making them unreliable and violating international legal standards.\n\nThe U.S. has called on China to uphold its international obligations and ensure that all individuals are treated fairly under the law. They have also urged the Chinese government to allow independent observers to monitor legal proceedings and ensure transparency in the justice system.

    "HWT": "They are better educated than before but fewer people own their own homes, the government welfare report said. The report found that most Australians were doing well but major challenges remained for Indigenous Australians. The disabled, people suffering mental illness and domestic violence victims were also faring less well. The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) report, issued every two years, says that a baby born between 2011 and 2013 can expect to live to 80.1 years if it is a boy and 84.3 if it is a girl. The national snapshot said 15% of the current population was aged 65 and over and by 2054 this was projected to increase to 21%, or 8.4 million people. About 3% of the population is Indigenous, it added. The report showed most children were doing well and most young people were studying or working, said Acting AIHW Director Kerry Flanagan. \"Adult participation in the labour force is higher than 20 years ago, and while some people are staying at work longer, after retirement, the majority of older Australians are not using aged care services,\" said Ms Flanagan. \"On the other hand, we see that 1 in 37 children are receiving child protection services, around 2 million Australians, mostly women, have experienced partner violence since the age of 15, youth unemployment exceeds 13%, and there's been little improvement in the proportion of young people who are not fully engaged in employment, education or training.\" About 28% of the population was born overseas, with the largest number coming from the UK, followed by New Zealand and China. That compares with 24% 10 years ago.",
    "MGT": "Australians are living longer and healthier lives, according to a new report highlighting the nation's impressive life expectancy and disability-free years. The report, released this week, reveals that Australians are among the global leaders in longevity, enjoying some of the highest life expectancies worldwide.\n\nThe data indicates a significant increase in the number of years Australians can expect to live without experiencing significant disability. This positive trend suggests improvements in healthcare, preventative medicine, and overall lifestyle choices are contributing to a healthier aging population.\n\nResearchers attribute the extended disability-free life expectancy to a combination of factors. Early detection and management of chronic diseases, such as heart disease and diabetes, play a crucial role. Furthermore, increased awareness of the importance of healthy diets, regular exercise, and avoiding smoking has likely contributed to the positive outcome.\n\nThe report also points to the effectiveness of Australia's robust healthcare system in providing access to quality medical care for its citizens. Universal healthcare coverage ensures that individuals can receive necessary treatments and interventions, regardless of their socioeconomic background.\n\nWhile the findings are encouraging, the report also acknowledges existing disparities in life expectancy and disability-free years across different population groups. Indigenous Australians, for example, continue to experience significantly lower life expectancies and a higher prevalence of disability compared to non-Indigenous Australians.\n\nAddressing these inequalities remains a key priority for policymakers and healthcare providers. Targeted interventions and culturally appropriate healthcare services are needed to close the gap and ensure that all Australians have the opportunity to live long and healthy lives.\n\nThe report serves as a valuable resource for informing public health policy and resource allocation. By understanding the factors that contribute to healthy aging, policymakers can develop strategies to further improve the health and well-being of the Australian population. It is also a testament to the ongoing efforts of healthcare professionals, researchers, and individuals who are committed to promoting healthy lifestyles and preventing chronic diseases.\n"

    "prompt": "The Dutch government has announced that it will ban the use of the mild narcotic khat.",
    "HWT": "It is a leaf-based drug that, when chewed, releases juices that act as natural stimulants and is popular with the Somali community. The Netherlands is used as a hub to transport khat imported from the Horn of Africa to other European countries. There are concerns that the drug can cause psychosis or bring on schizophrenia. The BBC's Anna Holligan in the Netherlands says the country has a traditionally liberal approach to soft drugs. However, a Dutch government report cited noise, litter and the perceived public threat posed by men who chew khat as some of the reasons for outlawing the drug. \"I'm involved in the ban because it appears to cause serious problems, particularly in the Somali community,\" Dutch immigration minister Gerd Leers is quoted as saying by Radio Netherlands. Source: www.talktofrank.com He said that 10% of Somali men in the Netherlands were badly affected by the drug. \"They are lethargic and refuse to co-operate with the government or take responsibility for themselves or their families,\" he said. Very few Dutch nationals use the drug, which is mainly chewed by people from Somalia, Ethiopia, Kenya and Yemen. Our reporter says more than 25,000 Somalis now live in the Netherlands and as the population arrived, the use of khat in the country grew. At the moment it is legally imported via Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport four times a week. Khat leaves need to be fresh, otherwise they lose their potency. Last year, khat worth around $18m (£11.6m) was brought into the Netherlands. The use of the stimulant is banned in the US, Canada and several other European countries. But it is still available in the UK where it is legally sold in a small number of grocery stores.",
    "MGT": "The Hague - The Dutch government announced today its decision to ban khat, a mild narcotic leaf widely used in the Horn of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. The ban, which is expected to take effect in the coming months, follows years of debate and research into the potential health and social consequences associated with the substance.\n\nKhat contains cathinone and cathine, amphetamine-like stimulants that produce feelings of euphoria, increased alertness, and suppressed appetite. Users typically chew the leaves for several hours, extracting the juices and discarding the fibrous residue.\n\nWhile khat is legal in several countries, including the United Kingdom, its use has been a subject of concern for authorities in the Netherlands. Opponents of khat argue that its prolonged use can lead to psychological dependence, insomnia, and cardiovascular problems. Additionally, concerns have been raised about the potential for social disruption and economic hardship within communities where khat chewing is prevalent.\n\nThe decision to ban khat comes after a comprehensive review by the National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM), which concluded that the risks associated with khat use outweigh its perceived benefits. The RIVM report highlighted the lack of conclusive evidence regarding the long-term effects of khat, but emphasized the potential for harm, particularly among vulnerable populations.\n\nThe ban is expected to impact primarily the Somali, Ethiopian, and Yemeni communities in the Netherlands, where khat chewing is a traditional social activity. The government has pledged to provide support and resources to help these communities adjust to the new regulations. This includes offering addiction counseling and promoting alternative social activities.\n\nReactions to the ban have been mixed. While some welcome the decision as a necessary step to protect public health, others express concern about the potential for stigmatization and marginalization of minority groups. Critics argue that the ban may drive the khat trade underground, making it more difficult to monitor and control.\n\nThe Dutch government maintains that the ban is a proportionate response to the potential risks associated with khat use and that it is committed to working with affected communities to mitigate any negative consequences. The implementation of the ban will be accompanied by a public awareness campaign to educate people about the risks of khat and to provide information about available support services.\n"

But Gormley said all art should be \"unsettling\" and his work was \"nothing to do with suicide\". The work is part of a sculpture park being created on the campus. One student said: \"I really did think it was someone who was going to jump off a building.\" Gormley is one the UK's leading artists and is probably best known for his Angel of the North. In defending the UEA installation, he said: \"These works are nothing to do with suicide, they're actually to do with life and they're placed on the skyline in a way to make us think about space and distance. \"Universities are places where people spend a lot of time thinking about the thoughts of others, \"I think it's a wonderful place to balance that intellectual life with an object that is silent, it doesn't need to be read.

While some have lauded the project as thought-provoking and visually arresting, others have expressed anxieties, ranging from aesthetic objections to concerns about the statues' potential impact on vulnerable individuals.\n\nGormley maintains that the installation is intended to be a positive contribution to the university's environment, designed to encourage reflection and contemplation. He argues that the positioning of the figures, often perched precariously on rooftops and ledges, is meant to evoke a sense of vulnerability and the precariousness of human existence. The artist believes the work prompts viewers to consider their place within the larger world and their relationship to the built environment.\n\n\"Art should challenge and provoke,\" Gormley stated. \"It's not meant to be simply decorative. 'Being Human' is an invitation to look, think, and question. I hope it encourages a renewed awareness of our shared humanity.\"\n\nCritics, however, remain unconvinced. Some argue that the figures, particularly those positioned in seemingly dangerous locations, could be triggering for individuals struggling with mental health issues. Others find the stark, metallic figures aesthetically jarring, clashing with the historic architecture of the university buildings. Concerns have also been raised about the potential for misinterpretation, with some fearing the statues could be misconstrued as promoting or glorifying self-harm.\n\nUniversity officials have defended the installation, emphasizing that it underwent a thorough risk assessment prior to its implementation. They also highlight the educational opportunities it provides, with planned lectures and workshops designed to explore the themes raised by the artwork. The university maintains that the installation is a valuable addition to the campus and encourages open dialogue and critical engagement with contemporary art. The installation is slated to remain in place for a year, providing ample opportunity for the community to engage with the artwork and form their own opinions.\n"

    "prompt": "Bombardier has backed its CSeries plane to win new orders, following the release of fresh technical data on its performance at the Paris Air Show.",
    "HWT": "Enterprise Minister Jonathan Bell visited company executives in the French capital and said: \"I have every belief in its success.\" The CSeries will enter service with airlines three years behind schedule next year. It is presently short of a 300-order target. Currently, firm orders are 243 and there has not been one since last September. It is also $2bn (£1.29bn) over budget. However, the Canadian aerospace company sees the CSeries Paris debut as a pivotal moment. \"There's always a lot of pressure to come up with big orders,\" president of commercial aircraft Fred Cromer told the BBC. \"But right now it's like the old-fashioned days - we are here to show off the equipment.\" The company's Belfast division makes the CSeries wings at a £520m factory in Queens Island. Full production of the two different sized versions of the aircraft would support 800 jobs in a workforce of 5,700. Invest NI chief executive Alastair Hamilton, who also attended the Paris launch, said:  \"I believe they will kick on from today. There are many years ahead for this aircraft.\" Bombardier's familiar territory is executive jets and this is a major step up into larger passenger planes seating between 100 to 160 passengers. Its competitors are the big two firms Boeing and Airbus. Aviation analyst Mark Pilling of Flightglobal said \"They're two great big gorillas. \"Bombardier need to execute on this aircraft and get orders.\" The technical data announced in Paris revealed improved results on fuel economy, the main selling point of the CSeries. The larger CS300 will fly to Belfast on Friday for what is seen as a morale-boosting visit for workers.",
    "MGT": "Bombardier reaffirmed its confidence in the CSeries aircraft at the Paris Air Show, bolstered by the release of new technical data highlighting the plane's performance capabilities. Company executives expressed optimism that the updated information would translate into new orders for the fuel-efficient jet.\n\nThe Canadian manufacturer has been actively promoting the CSeries as a game-changer in the 100-to-150-seat market, emphasizing its superior fuel efficiency and reduced noise footprint compared to competing aircraft. The newly released data further strengthens this narrative, providing potential customers with a more detailed understanding of the CSeries' operational advantages.\n\nWhile specific details of the technical data were not immediately disclosed, sources suggest it includes information on fuel burn, range, and takeoff and landing performance. These are crucial factors for airlines when evaluating aircraft for their fleets.\n\nThe CSeries program has faced challenges in the past, including delays and cost overruns. However, Bombardier has worked diligently to overcome these hurdles and establish the aircraft as a viable competitor in the narrow-body market. The company has already secured orders from several airlines, including Swiss International Air Lines and Air Canada.\n\nThe Paris Air Show provides a key platform for Bombardier to showcase the CSeries to a global audience of airline executives, industry analysts, and potential investors. The company hopes that the combination of updated technical data and face-to-face interactions will generate renewed interest in the aircraft and lead to further sales.\n\nCompetition in the narrow-body market is fierce, with Airbus and Boeing dominating the landscape. However, Bombardier believes that the CSeries offers a unique value proposition, particularly for airlines operating shorter routes or seeking to replace older, less efficient aircraft. The company is confident that the CSeries will continue to gain traction in the market as airlines recognize its economic and environmental benefits. The success of the CSeries is vital for Bombardier's future, as it represents a significant investment in the company's long-term growth strategy.\n"

    "HWT": "The figure-hugging Jean Louis gown, with 2,500 crystals, was bought by the Ripley's Believe It or Not museum chain, exceeding the $3m guide price. The company's vice president said it was \"most iconic piece of pop culture that there is\". Monroe died from a drug overdose just three months after the performance. The sultry rendition for President Kennedy's 45th birthday at a 1962 Democratic fundraiser at New York's Madison Square was one of her last public appearances. President Kennedy was shot dead a year later. The dress, which the auction house said was so tight she had to be sewn into it, had previously been bought at auction for $1.3m in 1999 by the late business mogul and collector Martin Zweig. The sum raised is likely to set a new world record for the most expensive dress sold at auction. Marilyn Monroe's billowing white dress from the Seven Year Itch sold for $4.6 million (plus $1m in commission) in 2011. The largest collection of the screen star's possessions ever offered for auction is being sold by Julien's auction house in Beverly Hills over three days. Also sold on Thursday was the cocktail dress she wore in \"Some Like it Hot\", which fetched $450,000.

The auction, held in Los Angeles, saw intense competition for the dress, which is considered one of Monroe's most memorable and recognizable garments.\n\nDesigned by Jean Louis, the dress was reportedly so form-fitting that Monroe had to be sewn into it before her performance at Madison Square Garden in 1962. The sheer fabric, adorned with thousands of sparkling rhinestones, created a dazzling effect under the spotlight.\n\nThe \"Happy Birthday\" performance, delivered just months before Monroe's untimely death, became a defining moment in both her career and American cultural history. The dress itself has since become an emblem of the actress's enduring appeal and the complex relationship between Hollywood and the political elite.\n\nThe dress was previously owned by Ripley's Believe It or Not!, who purchased it for $4.6 million in 2016.

    "prompt": "The fate of five Picasso murals on buildings damaged in the Anders Breivik bombing in Oslo in 2011 has led to a heated debate in Norway.",
    "HWT": "A panel of experts has recommended demolishing the buildings and removing the murals. But art experts say that as the murals were designed by Picasso for those specific buildings, they should remain where they are. The artworks were Picasso's first attempts at concrete murals. The murals were drawn specifically for the government buildings known as H and Y block. Picasso's designs were sandblasted onto the concrete both outside and inside the buildings by the Norwegian artist Carl Nesjar. Both buildings were damaged when Breivik set off a van bomb at the foot of H block in July 2011. It was the start of a series of attacks that left 77 dead, mostly teenagers on the island of Utoeya. The blast in Oslo killed eight people and badly damaged the H block, along with neighbouring ministries. A panel of experts has decided the most economical solution would be to demolish the buildings, cut the murals out and place them elsewhere. A recent poll by Norwegian newspaper Verdens Gang showed public opinion was divided, with 39.5% supporting demolition, while 34.3% thought the buildings should be kept. Artist Dag Hol was widely quoted as saying it was a \"golden opportunity\" to get rid of \"brutal, ugly and degrading architecture\". But Joern Holme, head of the Directorate for Cultural Heritage, said the buildings were historically important - architecturally, politically and artistically. \"We can't demolish the best (parts) of a cultural era just because we find it ugly today,\" he said. Norway's government has until early next year to decide what to do about the buildings. The rights to the murals are owned by the Picasso family and they must be consulted on what happens to them Claudia Andrieu, a legal expert with the Picasso Administration, said they have not been approached yet but are \"open to dialogue\".",
    "MGT": "Oslo, Norway – A decade after the devastating Anders Breivik bombing that rocked Oslo, a complex debate continues to rage regarding the future of five Picasso murals that adorned buildings severely damaged in the attack. The artworks, considered national treasures, have become symbols of resilience and a focal point in discussions about how Norway should remember and rebuild after the tragedy.\n\nThe murals, created in collaboration with Norwegian artist Carl Nesjar, are integrated into the facades of the buildings that housed government offices. The bombing, which targeted these buildings, left them structurally unsound, prompting extensive debate about whether to demolish, rebuild, or preserve them.\n\nThe core of the dispute lies in the question of whether the damaged buildings, with their embedded Picasso artworks, should be preserved as a memorial to the victims and a testament to the nation's strength in the face of extremism. Some argue that retaining the structures, including the murals, would serve as a constant reminder of the horrific events and a symbol of Norway's commitment to never forgetting the lives lost.\n\nConversely, others contend that the damaged buildings are a painful reminder of the attack and that demolishing them to make way for new, modern structures would represent a move forward and a rejection of the violence. They suggest that the murals could be carefully removed and relocated to museums or other public spaces where they can be properly preserved and appreciated without being associated with the trauma of the bombing.\n\nAdding another layer of complexity to the situation is the significant cost associated with both preserving and relocating the murals. Preservation would require extensive restoration work on the damaged buildings, while relocation would involve delicate and potentially risky procedures to detach the artworks without causing irreparable damage.\n\nThe Norwegian government has been grappling with this dilemma for years, commissioning expert reports and consulting with art historians, architects, and the families of the victims. A final decision is expected in the coming months, and it is anticipated to have a profound impact on Oslo's cityscape and the nation's collective memory of the 2011 attacks. The fate of the Picasso murals has become a microcosm of Norway's broader struggle to reconcile the need for remembrance with the desire for renewal.\n"

Rooney, who has captained both Manchester United and the national team, was pictured socializing late into the night after England's victory over Scotland.\n\nReports suggested that Rooney had been drinking at the team hotel. The FA launched an investigation into the events, but after reviewing the evidence and speaking with relevant parties, they have decided against imposing any sanctions.\n\nRooney has since apologized for his behavior, acknowledging that his actions were inappropriate for someone in his position. He has expressed his commitment to focusing on his football and contributing to both club and country. The decision not to pursue disciplinary measures aims to draw a line under the incident and allow Rooney to move forward without further distraction. Southgate is now focused on preparing the team for future matches.\n"

    "HWT": "The FTSE 100 closed up 57.5 points, or 0.82%, at 7,052.13, helped by Anglo America's 2.72% rise, and Rio Tinto and BHP Billiton adding 2.61% and 2.46% respectively. China's stimulus plan buoyed stocks, offsetting fears about Greece, which led to Friday's 1.3% FTSE 100 fall. Ashtead, up 2.88%, was the index's big gainer after Barclays tipped the stock. Another big mover was InterContinental Hotels, 2.35% higher on speculative chatter about a merger deal. Outside the 100 top companies, oilfield services provider Petrofac extended recent losses to finish down 10%. Petrofac said it would incur an additional Â£130m loss this year on its Laggan-Tormore gas plant project in the Shetland Islands.

The index saw renewed investor confidence, driven primarily by a surge in the performance of mining companies.\n\nThe mining sector emerged as the day's strongest performer, buoyed by positive sentiment surrounding commodity prices and renewed demand from key markets. Shares in major mining firms experienced notable gains, contributing significantly to the overall upward trend of the FTSE 100.\n\nWhile the recovery offered some respite after Friday's sharp decline, analysts cautioned against excessive optimism. Market volatility remains a concern, influenced by global economic uncertainties and ongoing geopolitical tensions. The index's performance in the coming days will likely depend on a range of factors, including further developments in commodity markets, investor reaction to upcoming economic data releases, and the evolving global economic landscape.\n"

About 50 people are said to have died as militants armed with guns, grenades and knives targeted patients and staff at the hospital. The brutal assault caused shock and anger among the public. Many people are still demanding to know why a building that was meant to be secure was so vulnerable to attack. The hospital is heavily guarded and the government says the attackers got inside after exploding a car bomb at the gate. But other reports suggest some attackers were already inside the hospital when the violence began, meaning militants had infiltrated the high-security site. There is also a lack of clarity over how many people died. Some hospital workers quoted in local media said the toll was much higher than the figure of about 50 reported by the government. The so-called Islamic State group said it carried out the attack, but some eyewitnesses later told media the assailants shouted slogans in support of the Taliban.

The Islamic State group claimed responsibility for the assault.\n\nThe Defence Ministry did not release the names or specific ranks of the officers who were relieved of their duties. However, a statement indicated that the dismissals were a direct consequence of negligence and failure to adequately secure the hospital premises.\n\n“The investigation revealed serious shortcomings in security protocols and command oversight,” the statement read. “Those found responsible for these failures will be held accountable.”\n\nThe ministry added that further investigations are underway to determine if additional personnel were complicit in the security lapse. The government has pledged to strengthen security measures at all military installations and hospitals across the country to prevent future attacks.

The woman managed to free herself from the vehicle on her third attempt but was groped during the abduction. Police praised the courage of the victim in speaking about the ordeal, which lasted for several minutes. More on the football coach jailed for sex attack, and other news Reilly, of Maunders Place, trained to be a football coach as part of a community programme run by Exeter City Football Club. The court heard character references from the club's Head of Community Jamie Vittles as well as Exmouth Town manager Richard Pears.

    "MGT": "A former football coach has been sentenced to 18 months in prison after being convicted of abduction and sexual assault. The charges stem from an incident involving a teenage girl, whose identity is being protected. The sentencing took place at the County Courthouse yesterday, following a lengthy and emotionally charged trial.\n\nThe prosecution presented evidence detailing how the coach, whose name is being withheld to protect the victim's privacy, lured the teenager into his vehicle under false pretenses. He then drove her to a secluded location where the sexual assault occurred. The victim's testimony was a central part of the prosecution's case, and she recounted the harrowing experience with bravery and composure.\n\nThe defense argued that the encounter was consensual, but the jury ultimately sided with the prosecution, finding the coach guilty on both counts. Judge Thompson, presiding over the case, described the coach's actions as a gross betrayal of trust and a violation of the victim's fundamental rights.\n\n\"This was not simply a lapse in judgment,\" Judge Thompson stated during the sentencing. \"This was a calculated act of manipulation and violence that has had a profound and lasting impact on the victim's life.\"\n\nIn addition to the prison sentence, the coach has been ordered to register as a sex offender and will be subject to a restraining order preventing him from contacting the victim. The victim's family released a statement expressing their relief at the outcome of the trial and their hope that the sentencing will provide some measure of closure. They also thanked the community for their support throughout the ordeal. The conviction has sent shockwaves through the local community, particularly among parents and former students who had previously viewed the coach as a positive role model.\n"

Since then he has become Exeter's record Premiership points-scorer, with 953, and equalled the top flight record of nine penalties in a match in 2014. \"I was lucky enough to get capped before I came over here,\" added Whitten, who agreed a new contract at Sandy Park last week. \"But similar to the English, although they don't openly say it, they don't like to pick guys playing outside of Ireland. \"That's fair enough, I accept that stance, and I enjoy playing here.

    "HWT": "Interior Ministry spokesman Sediq Sediqqi tweeted that 64 \"innocent Afghans\" were killed and 347 wounded. A suicide attacker detonated a vehicle and a fierce gun battle followed in one of the deadliest attacks in Kabul for years. A Taliban spokesman said the group carried out the attack. It came a week after it said it was launching its \"spring offensive\", warning of large-scale attacks, although the group fights all year round. Why are the Taliban resurgent in Afghanistan? Tuesday's bombing happened during the morning rush hour in Pul-e-Mahmud, a busy neighbourhood where homes, mosques, schools and businesses nestle close to the ministry of defence, other ministries and military compounds. The blast shattered windows up to 1.6km (one mile) away. A police officer told the Associated Press it was one of the most powerful explosions he had ever heard, and he could not see or hear anything for 20 minutes after. It appears the initial blast cleared the way for Taliban fighters to enter the area - a commonly used tactic. It had previously been reported that at least 28 people had been killed and 329 injured. Mr Sediqqi told reporters that most of the 64 now reported dead were civilians. He said most of the wounded were in a stable condition. At least 71 Shia worshippers were killed in 2011 in a rare attack on a Shia shrine in Kabul.

Emergency services are still sifting through the rubble, searching for survivors and recovering the deceased.\n\nThe explosion occurred in a densely populated area of Kabul, causing widespread damage to buildings and infrastructure. The force of the blast shattered windows, collapsed walls, and ignited fires, leaving many residents displaced and in desperate need of assistance.\n\nThe Afghan government has declared a national day of mourning to honor the victims and express solidarity with the affected families. Condolences have poured in from around the world, with international leaders condemning the attack and offering support to Afghanistan.\n\nAuthorities are still investigating the cause of the explosion, but initial reports suggest it may have been a suicide bombing.

Sean Newton's long seventh-minute throw-in was headed on by Vadaine Oliver for Parkin to volley home at the far post, and the striker then finished off a similar move with another close-range finish six minutes later. York keeper Kyle Letheren had a moment to forget when he failed to deal with Ross Stearn's simple in-swinging free-kick and allowed the ball to bounce between his legs into the back of the net. After the break, Spitfires defender Gavin Hoyte somehow cleared Amari Morgan-Smith's close-range shot off the line. Substitute Tyler Garratt then hit the post at the other end with a bouncing 25-yard drive. Oliver nearly restored York's two-goal lead when his header from an Asa Hall corner was pushed against the bar by keeper Ryan Clarke.

The Minstermen delivered a display of resilience and attacking prowess, leaving their Hampshire opponents still searching for their first win of the calendar year.\n\nThe home side started brightly, pressing Eastleigh high up the pitch and creating several early opportunities. Their persistence paid off midway through the first half when a well-worked move culminated in a close-range finish. The goal ignited the home crowd and spurred York on to further attacking endeavors.\n\nEastleigh, struggling to find their rhythm, were largely restricted to counter-attacks, which York's defense dealt with comfortably. The visitors looked disjointed in possession and lacked the creativity to unlock the York backline.\n\nYork doubled their advantage early in the second half, capitalizing on a defensive lapse by Eastleigh. A swift counter-attack saw the ball played through to the forward, who calmly slotted past the goalkeeper.\n\nThe second goal seemed to deflate Eastleigh further, and York continued to dominate proceedings. The home side controlled the midfield, dictating the tempo of the game and denying Eastleigh any sustained period of possession.\n\nEastleigh attempted to rally, introducing fresh legs from the bench in an effort to inject some urgency into their play. However, their efforts proved futile, as York remained resolute in defense and continued to pose a threat on the break.\n\nIn the closing stages of the game, York added a third goal, putting the result beyond any doubt. A stunning strike from outside the box sailed into the top corner, sending the home fans into raptures.\n\nThe final whistle was met with jubilation from the York faithful, who celebrated a crucial victory that lifts their team out of the relegation zone. The win marks a significant turnaround in form for York, who have struggled for consistency throughout the season.\n\nFor Eastleigh, the defeat represents another setback in their search for form. They remain without a win this year and will need to find a solution to their attacking woes if they are to turn their season around. The team's inability to convert chances and defensive vulnerabilities continue to plague their performances.\n\nYork, buoyed by this result, will look to build on this momentum in their upcoming fixtures. The team's improved defensive solidity and increased attacking threat will give them confidence as they navigate the challenges ahead.\n"

    "HWT": "An Air India official told the BBC that the order had been made on the basis of a document issued by the civil aviation authority last year. The airline had warned 600 of its crew to \"shape up\" last year, but 125 had not managed to maintain the required weight, the official said. The airline says however that the issue is not one of weight, but \"fitness\". Airline officials confirmed to the BBC that the directive had been issued, but said it was part of an internal document which they could not comment on publicly. They said the basis for the recommendation was concern that \"unfit\" cabin crew would not be able to operate efficiently in emergency situations. Aviation regulations state that a Body Mass Index (BMI) of 18-25 is normal for a male cabin crew member, while for a female it is 18-22. Aviation expert Kapil Kaul told the BBC: \"An overweight crew is a signal the airline is not fit. You need a smart friendly agile crew that can complement the image of the airline.\" However, national union leader Tapan Sen denied that service rules mention any firm weight restriction for cabin crew. This is not the first time Air India has grounded staff over weight issues. In 2009, it dismissed nine hostesses for being \"overweight\" on safety grounds saying their shape could \"impair agility\". In 2004, the airline landed itself in further controversy when it said that potential air hostesses and stewards should not have any scars, acne, or any major marks on the face.",
    "MGT": "Air India is reportedly grounding 125 members of its cabin crew due to weight concerns. The airline, India's national carrier, has implemented stricter fitness standards, leading to the temporary removal of these crew members from flight duties. This move is part of a broader initiative by Air India to optimize operational efficiency and enhance safety protocols.\n\nThe decision follows a comprehensive review of cabin crew health and fitness, where it was determined that these individuals exceeded the airline's established Body Mass Index (BMI) parameters. While specific details of the BMI thresholds were not disclosed, sources within the airline confirmed that the grounded crew members have been given a specified timeframe to meet the required standards.\n\nDuring their time off flight duty, the affected crew members will undergo counseling and participate in weight management programs designed to help them achieve the necessary fitness levels. Air India is providing resources and support to facilitate their return to active flying status.\n\nThe airline emphasized that this decision is not discriminatory and is solely based on safety considerations. Excess weight can potentially hinder a crew member's ability to perform critical duties during emergencies, such as evacuation procedures or assisting passengers.\n\nThis measure is not unprecedented within the aviation industry. Several international airlines have previously implemented similar policies regarding crew weight, citing safety as the primary justification. Air India maintains that its commitment to passenger and crew safety remains paramount, and this decision reflects its dedication to upholding the highest standards of operational excellence. The airline expects the affected crew members to return to their duties once they meet the established weight requirements.\n"

    "HWT": "Tourist guide John Alasdair Macdonald captured his image on a compact camera near Dochfour at about 21:00 on Sunday. The Maritime and Coastguard Agency got calls from people in the Highlands, Dumfries and Galloway and Cumbria concerned it was a distress flare. Mr Macdonald described his images as a \"fluke\". Mr Macdonald said: \"I was taking some new pictures to put on my Facebook page using a Sony RX100 compact camera. \"It was a beautiful, clear night and I got some nice pictures but capturing the meteor was a fluke. I will never take a picture like that again.\" Mr Macdonald, who runs the business The Hebridean Explorer, said he had seen messages on social media of a meteor being seen elsewhere, including Sleat on Skye. Meteor sightings were also said to have been made from North Uist, Oban and Mull. A \"meteorite\" mistaken for a distress flare also sparked a lifeboat search operation off the English coast on Sunday. Maryport Coastguard Rescue Team said it received numerous reports of a moving red object over the sea between Workington, Cumbria, and the Isle of Whithorn in Dumfries and Galloway. Did you see the meteor?",
    "MGT": "A bright meteor streaked across the skies above Scotland and England on Saturday night, sparking numerous reports and captivating onlookers. The celestial event, visible for several seconds, prompted some concerned citizens to contact the Coastguard, possibly mistaking the fiery trail for a distress signal.\n\nThe phenomenon was witnessed across a wide geographical area, with reports flooding in from both Scotland and England. Social media platforms were quickly inundated with posts describing the dazzling display.\n\nAdding to the spectacle, amateur photographer, captured a stunning image of the meteor from the shores of the iconic Loch Ness. The photograph shows the meteor blazing across the night sky, leaving a vibrant trail in its wake.\n\nExperts believe the meteor was likely a small space rock that burned up as it entered Earth's atmosphere. The intense heat generated by friction with the air caused the rock to vaporize, creating the brilliant light we observed.\n\nWhile the incident caused some initial alarm, authorities confirmed that there were no emergencies related to the meteor sighting. The Coastguard confirmed they received calls but determined they were related to the meteor. \n\nThe event serves as a reminder of the constant stream of space debris that enters our atmosphere and the captivating beauty of natural phenomena. For those who witnessed the meteor, it was a memorable and awe-inspiring experience.\n"

    "HWT": "The homes are planned to be for social or mid-market rent and it is hoped they will all be completed by 2021. Glasgow City Council's executive committee also approved £20m to improve existing housing. Of this, £14m was announced last month as part of scheme to upgrade homes and make them available for social renting. The £34m four-year improvement and repair scheme is also being funded with £20m from the Scottish government. The funding to build homes is to be channelled through housing associations over the next four years. Eight sites in the area have been identified for development. As part of the strategy, Govanhill Housing Association has also committed £3.7m to new housing and repairs for the duration of the four year period. Overall this means there are plans to invest more than £44m in housing in Govanhill over the next four years. Councillor George Redmond: \"This is an impressive document and points to the way ahead in Govanhill.\" \"Significant sums are being invested in Govanhill and it is great news that part of that money will go towards new housing. \"The council has been working exceptionally hard to turn things around in Govanhill and we are starting to see real progress being made.\" He said that while the council was keen to work with all property owners in Govanhill, he warned the council would use power of compulsory purchase against those who refused to get on board with the plans.",
    "MGT": "Glasgow City Council has announced a significant investment of £6.4 million in a housing initiative aimed at revitalizing the Govanhill area. The ambitious project will see the construction of approximately 350 new homes, a move officials hope will be a catalyst for positive change in the community.\n\nThe council's decision underscores its commitment to addressing housing needs and fostering sustainable urban development. Govanhill, a densely populated area with a diverse population, has faced challenges related to housing quality and availability. The new homes are intended to alleviate some of these pressures and contribute to a more vibrant and thriving neighborhood.\n\nDetails regarding the specific locations and types of housing are expected to be released in the coming weeks. However, council representatives have indicated a focus on providing a mix of affordable and market-rate options to cater to a range of residents. The project will likely incorporate environmentally conscious design and construction practices.\n\nLocal residents and community organizations have expressed cautious optimism about the initiative. While welcoming the prospect of new housing, some have emphasized the importance of ensuring that the development benefits existing residents and does not lead to displacement or gentrification. There are also calls for the Council to make sure that the new builds have no effect on the surrounding environment.\n\nThe Govanhill housing project is part of a broader strategy to regenerate communities across Glasgow. City officials believe that strategic investments in housing and infrastructure can create positive ripple effects, attracting businesses, improving public spaces, and ultimately enhancing the quality of life for all residents. The project is expected to create job opportunities during the construction phase and contribute to the long-term economic vitality of the area.\n"

    "HWT": "Scientists gave mice drinking water laced with three amino acids. They said the rodents lived significantly longer than other mice fed a normal diet. The research, reported in a scientific journal, has yet to be tried in people. The study leader said a large patient trial was needed to provide evidence to convince doctors. In experiments, middle-aged healthy male mice were given drinking water containing the amino acids leucine, isoleucine and valine. Dr Enzo Nisoli, of the University of Milan, and colleagues, said it increased the average lifespan of the mice by 12% and boosted their fitness and co-ordination. They wrote in their paper, published in Cell Metabolism: \"Our study offers a rationale for deeply exploring the role of amino acids in prevention and control of age-related disorders in humans.\" The amino acids - three of the 20 that make up proteins - have been shown to extend life span in yeast. However, the precise role of these amino acids in humans is unknown. They are used by bodybuilders to maintain muscle tissue and can be bought in health food stores and online.",
    "MGT": "The quest for extending human lifespan has taken a new turn, with researchers exploring the potential of amino acids, the fundamental components of proteins. These building blocks are not just essential for muscle growth and repair; emerging evidence suggests they may hold the key to slowing down the aging process.\n\nStudies have revealed that specific combinations of amino acids can trigger cellular mechanisms that promote longevity. These mechanisms include enhanced protein synthesis, improved mitochondrial function, and reduced oxidative stress. By optimizing these processes, the cocktail of amino acids could potentially delay age-related diseases and extend overall healthspan.\n\nWhile the research is still in its early stages, the results are promising. Animal studies have shown that amino acid supplementation can increase lifespan and improve physical performance in older individuals. Human trials are now underway to assess the effects of amino acid cocktails on various markers of aging, such as muscle mass, cognitive function, and cardiovascular health.\n\nHowever, experts caution that amino acid supplementation is not a magic bullet for immortality. A healthy lifestyle, including a balanced diet and regular exercise, remains crucial for overall well-being and longevity. Nevertheless, the potential of amino acids to modulate the aging process is an exciting area of research that could lead to new strategies for promoting healthy aging and extending human lifespan.\n"

    "HWT": "Hawkins won a draining final-frame thriller 13-12 over the pre-tournament favourite late on Monday night. But the Englishman was way below his best from the start against the world number 14 on Tuesday. He scored only 31 points as he lost the first five frames. Hawkins got on the board in frame six, but Fu easily won the last two frames to earn a six-frame advantage after the first session. The quarter-final tie is the best of 25 frames and the second session gets under way on Wednesday at 14:30 BST. Fu played with fluency and impressive cue ball control to take full advantage of some sloppy play by 2013 runner-up Hawkins - the only man to have made the semi-finals, when the Crucible switches to one table - in each of the last three years. But his chances of repeating that feat appear slim after being completely outplayed by London-based Fu, who recorded three half-centuries on his way to a 5-0 lead. World number 11 Hawkins took a scrappy sixth frame, but two half-centuries gave Fu frame seven and he rounded off the session with his sixth score of more than 50. The other afternoon match saw four-time champion John Higgins win four frames in a row to take a 5-3 lead in his all-Scottish meeting with Alan McManus. McManus, twice a World Championship quarter-finalist in the early 1990s, lost the opener but was then in imperious form as he secured a 3-1 mid-session interval lead with breaks of 114, 78 and 56. But the 45-year-old was out of sorts after the interval, appearing to be troubled by a neck problem. And Higgins, who has gone on to lift the title on the last three occasions he has reached the last eight at the Crucible, made the most of some decent chances to take control.

    "MGT": "Sheffield - Barry Hawkins experienced a dramatic reversal of fortune at the Crucible Theatre, finding himself trailing Marco Fu 7-1 after the first session of their World Championship quarter-final clash. Just hours after securing a hard-fought victory over Ronnie O'Sullivan, Hawkins appeared a shadow of his former self, struggling to find any rhythm against a clinical Fu.\n\nThe match started promisingly enough, with both players exchanging safety shots in the opening frame. However, it was Fu who capitalized on the first mistake, crafting a well-constructed break of 68 to take the lead. Hawkins, visibly fatigued from his previous encounter, struggled to respond.\n\nFu continued to dominate, capitalizing on every opportunity presented to him. He secured the second frame with a break of 52 and then extended his lead further with a masterful century break of 104 in the third. Hawkins, known for his solid break-building, failed to pot a single ball in the third frame.\n\nThe fourth frame followed a similar pattern, with Fu maintaining control and extending his advantage. Hawkins looked increasingly frustrated, his body language reflecting his struggles. The mid-session interval did little to change the momentum, as Fu returned to the table with renewed vigor.\n\nUpon resumption, Fu continued his relentless assault, taking the fifth and sixth frames with relative ease. Hawkins, desperate to stem the tide, attempted to change his approach, but his efforts proved futile. Fu was in complete control, dictating the pace and flow of the match.\n\nThe seventh frame saw Fu compile another substantial break of 78, leaving Hawkins stranded at the table. The Hong Kong cueman was showcasing a level of precision and composure that Hawkins simply couldn't match.\n\nThe final frame of the session saw Hawkins squander a chance to get a foothold in the match. He missed a relatively straightforward red, allowing Fu to step in and secure the frame, completing a dominant session and establishing a commanding 7-1 lead.\n\nHawkins now faces an uphill battle to salvage the match. He will need to regroup overnight and come back with a renewed sense of purpose if he hopes to turn the tide against the in-form Marco Fu. The second session promises to be a crucial test of Hawkins' resilience and determination.\n"

    "HWT": "Police were trying to clear the blockade, which has cut supply lines of fuel and other goods, when protesters attacked a police post at Birgunj. Reports say the man was shot in the head and later died in hospital. The demonstrators, mainly from southern lowland minority groups, are angry about Nepal's new constitution. Communities from the lowlands believe that Nepal's proposed new provinces will lead to their political marginalisation. These concerns have led to violent clashes around Nepal since August, leaving dozens dead. The protester killed on Monday was identified as Ashish Kumar Ram, from Raxaul in the Indian state of Bihar, local officials said. Local police chief Rajubabu Shrestha told the BBC the protesters had entered Nepali territory from India, throwing stones. He said seven protesters and nine police had been injured. Nepal's Home Ministry Spokesman Laxmi Dhakal said two Indian nationals were arrested after they tried to obstruct police who were removing tents at the border. India said it was \"deeply concerned\" by events. \"Issues facing Nepal are political in nature and cannot be resolved by force. \"Causes underlying the present state of confrontation need to addressed by the government of Nepal credibly and effectively,\" the Indian foreign ministry said in a statement. Earlier, there were conflicting reports about the police crackdown. One report said police baton-charged demonstrators forcing them to remove the blockade, while another said authorities removed the tents of sleeping protesters and lined up trucks to pass through the crossing. Police official Hobindra Bogati told the Associated Press news agency that more than 200 trucks and other vehicles had crossed from Birgunj in Nepal to Raxaul and more were lining up. But, on the Indian side, thousands of trucks have not been able to cross over to Nepal for almost two months.  Reports said the trucks bringing fuel and other goods to Nepal were still blocked by Indian custom officials.",
    "MGT": "A tense situation unfolded at the Indo-Nepal border on Monday, resulting in the death of an Indian national after Nepali police opened fire on demonstrators. Hundreds of protestors had gathered at the border crossing, effectively halting the movement of goods and people between the two countries. The demonstration was reportedly organized to voice grievances against the Nepali government.\n\nDetails surrounding the exact sequence of events remain murky and contested. Nepali authorities claim that the police were forced to resort to firing live rounds after the protestors turned violent, allegedly attacking officers with stones and other projectiles. They maintain that the use of force was a last resort to maintain order and prevent further escalation.\n\nHowever, eyewitness accounts paint a different picture. Some witnesses allege that the protestors were largely peaceful, engaging in a sit-in protest and chanting slogans. They claim that the police action was disproportionate and unwarranted, accusing them of firing indiscriminately into the crowd.\n\nThe deceased has been identified as an Indian citizen residing in a nearby border village. His death has sparked outrage and condemnation in India, with calls for a thorough and impartial investigation into the incident. Indian officials have expressed serious concern over the use of force by Nepali police and have urged the Nepali government to exercise restraint in handling protests.\n\nThe incident threatens to strain relations between India and Nepal, which have historically enjoyed close ties. The border crossing is a vital trade route for both countries, and its closure is likely to have significant economic consequences. The disruption of trade could lead to shortages of essential goods and price hikes, further exacerbating tensions in the region.\n\nBoth governments are under pressure to de-escalate the situation and prevent further violence. Diplomatic efforts are underway to address the underlying grievances of the protestors and find a peaceful resolution to the impasse. The Indian government has called for dialogue and urged the Nepali government to engage with the protestors in a constructive manner. The Nepali government has assured that the incident will be investigated and appropriate action will be taken.\n"

Militants, utilizing a combination of small arms fire, roadside bombs, and mortar attacks, sought to destabilize the security situation and gain territorial control.\n\nIraqi security forces, supported by tribal fighters who have allied themselves with the government, mounted a fierce defense against the militant onslaught. However, the intensity of the attacks and the militants' strategic positioning made it difficult for the security forces to repel the advances.\n\nThe clashes resulted in heavy casualties on both sides, with the death toll among Iraqi troops and pro-government fighters continuing to rise throughout the day. In addition to the fatalities, dozens more were wounded in the fighting, straining the capacity of local medical facilities.\n\nThe security situation in Anbar province remains precarious, with the potential for further escalation in the coming days. The Iraqi government has vowed to intensify its efforts to combat militancy in the region and restore stability. Additional security forces have been deployed to Anbar in an attempt to reinforce existing units and prevent further attacks.\n\nThe ongoing violence in Anbar underscores the persistent challenges facing Iraq as it struggles to maintain security and stability in the face of ongoing threats from various militant groups.

Mr Lammy, Ms Jowell, Ms Abbott and Mr Wolmar all criticised the policy, with Ms Jowell saying that while it had been \"well intentioned\" it had been \"emblematically disastrous\" for Labour because it had caused people \"anxiety\" even if they weren't affected.",
    "MGT": "The leading contenders vying for Labour's nomination in the upcoming London mayoral election engaged in a spirited debate last night, with airport expansion emerging as a key point of contention. The hustings, the first official forum for the candidates, saw a clear divergence in opinion on the contentious issue of increasing airport capacity in the London area.\n\nSadiq Khan, the current Mayor of London and frontrunner in the race, reiterated his long-standing opposition to further expansion at Heathrow Airport. He cited concerns about increased noise pollution, air quality deterioration, and the detrimental impact on local communities already burdened by the airport's existing operations. Khan emphasized the need for sustainable transportation solutions and argued that expanding Heathrow would undermine London's commitment to tackling climate change.\n\nChallenging Khan's position, candidate Vanessa Allen argued that expanding airport capacity was crucial for London's economic competitiveness. She maintained that Heathrow's expansion would create thousands of jobs, boost trade, and solidify London's position as a global hub. Allen acknowledged the environmental concerns but insisted that technological advancements and mitigation strategies could minimize the impact of expansion. She accused Khan of prioritizing environmental concerns over economic growth, suggesting that a balanced approach was necessary.\n\nAnother candidate, David Lammy, took a more nuanced stance, acknowledging both the economic benefits and environmental drawbacks of airport expansion. He called for a thorough and independent assessment of the potential impacts, emphasizing the need for robust environmental safeguards and community engagement. Lammy also highlighted the importance of investing in alternative transportation infrastructure, such as high-speed rail, to reduce reliance on air travel.\n\nThe debate also touched upon other key issues facing London, including housing affordability, crime rates, and the cost of living crisis. However, the sharpest exchanges occurred over airport expansion, highlighting the differing priorities and visions of the candidates.\n\nThe hustings provided a platform for Labour members to assess the candidates' positions on a range of critical issues and to scrutinize their suitability to lead London. With the mayoral election expected to be closely contested, the outcome of the Labour nomination process will be pivotal in determining the political landscape of the capital. The debate underscored the complexity of the issues facing London and the challenges of balancing economic growth with environmental sustainability.\n"

    "HWT": "In a filing with US regulators, Alibaba said second-quarter profit was 12.3bn renminbi ($2bn; £1.2bn), compared to 4.3bn renminbi last year. The firm will list on the New York Stock Exchange later this year. It is expected to be the biggest internet stock offering since Facebook's in 2012. Many analysts believe that the company could raise over $20bn in its stock market debut, which is expected to happen in September. That would value the company at somewhere between $130bn and $150bn. Those hoping to invest in the firm - which controls the lion's share of China's rapidly expanding e-commerce market - were cheered by the increasing number of users accessing Alibaba's various sites via their smartphones. Monthly active mobile users increased to 188 million for the quarter, which ended on 30 June, an increase of 25 million from the prior quarter. And those users were increasingly eager to spend: Alibaba said mobile merchandise sales nearly quadrupled, and now make up nearly a third of all merchandise volume sold on the site. Founded in 1999 by Jack Ma, Alibaba controls several popular internet sites in China, including Tmall - where brands can sell their wares - and Taobao, the world's largest online shopping website.",
    "MGT": "Alibaba Group, the Chinese e-commerce behemoth, has announced a surge in profits, nearly tripling in the latest financial quarter. The impressive financial results come as the company prepares for its highly anticipated initial public offering (IPO) on the US stock market this autumn.\n\nThe substantial increase in profitability underscores Alibaba's dominant position in the burgeoning Chinese online retail sector. Analysts attribute the growth to a combination of factors, including a rapidly expanding user base, increased spending per customer, and the company's successful diversification into new markets and services.\n\nThe IPO is expected to be one of the largest in history, potentially valuing Alibaba at over $200 billion. The company's decision to list in the United States reflects its ambition to attract international investors and further solidify its global presence.\n\nWhile the exact timing and pricing of the IPO remain uncertain, market observers predict strong demand for Alibaba's shares. The company's robust financial performance, coupled with the immense growth potential of the Chinese e-commerce market, makes it an attractive investment opportunity for both institutional and retail investors.\n\nThe IPO is also expected to have a significant impact on the broader technology landscape, potentially paving the way for other Chinese tech companies to seek listings on US exchanges. Alibaba's success could further fuel the growth of the Chinese internet economy and solidify its position as a global leader in e-commerce.\n"

    "HWT": "Joseph Phelps of Newbridge RFC cannot play for four years, making him the 13th Welsh rugby union player to currently be serving a ban. United Kingdom Anti-Doping says Phelps' use of nandrolone was detected in June 2015 and he is banned until July 2019. A summary of the tribunal published by Ukad said Phelps claimed he had taken Viagra and a \"test booster\" product to treat erectile dysfunction. He also claimed not to have taken anything \"for performance enhancement in sport\" but to treat symptoms he had suffered after sustaining a testicular injury. A report by Professor David Cowan, Director of the Drug Control Centre at King's College London, confirmed to the tribunal that \"the human body does not naturally produce nandrolone in measurable quantities and that nandrolone is a drug administered via deep intra-muscular injection\". Ukad legal chief Graham Arthur said athletes are \"solely responsible\" for banned substance found in their system. Arthur added: \"This case highlights that all athletes, regardless of level, must be aware, and understand, the risks to their sporting careers if they test positive. \"They must ensure they manage that risk at all times.\" Phelps' ban comes less than a month after Ukad chief executive Nicole Sapstead said a \"societal problem\" could be the cause of steroid drug use in Welsh rugby.

The player, who has not yet been publicly identified by name, was found to have a steroid present in their system during a routine drug test conducted by anti-doping authorities.\n\nThe positive test has sent shockwaves through the Welsh rugby community, with many expressing disappointment and concern over the implications for the sport's integrity. Details surrounding the specific steroid detected and the circumstances leading to its presence are currently limited, pending further investigation.\n\nRugby authorities have confirmed that the player has been provisionally suspended from all rugby activities, effective immediately. He is entitled to request a hearing to challenge the findings of the test and present any mitigating circumstances. The length of the ban will depend on the severity of the infraction and any evidence presented during the disciplinary process.\n\nThe Welsh Rugby Union has issued a statement emphasizing its commitment to maintaining a clean and fair playing field. They stated that they have a zero-tolerance policy towards doping and will cooperate fully with anti-doping agencies to ensure that the rules are enforced.\n\nThis incident serves as a stark reminder of the ongoing challenges faced by sports organizations in combating performance-enhancing drugs. It also highlights the importance of rigorous testing and education programs to deter athletes from engaging in such practices.\n\nThe investigation into the matter is ongoing, and further updates will be provided as they become available.

Awel Deg care home was shut in February 2014, making 40 employees redundant. The council said it was working with Mr Garthwaite. Awel Deg was closed following the suspension of 11 members of staff and concerns about standards of care. The council said in May 2014 the facility would re-open as a dementia home in spring 2015, but a spokesman said on Wednesday that this could not happen until Mr Garthwaite's investigation was complete. Jeff Baker, regional organiser for Unison, said the union had written to the council complaining about the wait. \"It is very disappointing,\" he said. \"Unison understands that Mr Garthwaite cannot complete his report because the council has not taken steps to provide answers to key matters that Mr Garthwaite has put forward.\" A council spokesman said it was aware of Unison's comments. \"The council is working with Tony Garthwaite... to ensure that he has access to all the relevant information that he requires in order that he can complete his investigation,\" the spokesman said.",

The accusation comes from a prominent union, which claims the council has failed to cooperate fully with inquiries surrounding the controversial decision.\n\nThe union asserts that vital information and documentation have been withheld, hindering efforts to understand the rationale behind the closure and its impact on residents and staff. They express concern that this lack of transparency undermines accountability and raises questions about the council's commitment to open governance.\n\nThe closure of the Llandysul residential home sparked considerable public outcry, with residents' families and local community members voicing concerns about the displacement of vulnerable individuals and the loss of essential care services. The union has been actively involved in advocating for the rights of affected residents and seeking clarity on the decision-making process.\n\nCouncil officials have yet to issue a formal response to the specific allegations of non-cooperation. However, sources within the council have indicated that they are committed to providing all necessary information and cooperating fully with any legitimate investigation. They maintain that the closure was a difficult but necessary decision, driven by financial constraints and the need to modernize care services.\n\nThe union's claims are likely to intensify scrutiny of the council's actions and put further pressure on them to address the concerns raised by affected residents and the wider community. The outcome of the investigation could have significant implications for the future of residential care provision in Ceredigion.\n"

They're a real threat at set-plays also. \"We know we need to bring the type of performance that we've had against them here in Dingwall over the last year or so.

    "HWT": "The incident happened near Byfield 2,000ft (610m) over the skies of Northamptonshire, in May. The pilot of the Van's RV-6 two-seater, single engine craft had to take evasive action, and the drone passed down the left-hand side of the aircraft. He reported the near-miss, but the drone could not be seen on radar and the operator could not be traced. The UK Airprox Board, set up to enhance air safety in the UK, branded the risk rating a \"category B\", meaning the aircraft's security was compromised. The pilot described the drone as a \"red and yellow, three-rotor drone\", which was the \"type that can be easily bought in shops and not a commercial surveillance type vehicle\". The report states the drone operator should not have been operating the drone at such a high altitude. It says: \"Because the drone was being operated at an altitude it should not have been, the reported drone was flown into conflict with the RV6. \"Although there was no radar data to measure the exact separation, the Board thought it was clear from the pilot's report that this was a fairly close encounter, and they assessed the risk as Category B.\"",
    "MGT": "A light aircraft's safety was jeopardized in a close encounter with a commercial drone, according to an official investigation. The incident, which occurred on Tuesday, has raised concerns about the increasing prevalence of drones in civilian airspace and the potential risks they pose to manned aircraft.\n\nThe near-miss happened at approximately 3:15 PM local time, when the pilot of a small, single-engine plane reported seeing a drone passing within an estimated 50 feet of their aircraft. The pilot was able to take evasive action, averting a potential collision. The incident took place at an altitude of around 1,800 feet, in an area not restricted to drone operations, but frequently used by light aircraft.\n\nInvestigators have launched an inquiry to determine the drone operator’s identity and the reasons behind the drone’s presence in that airspace. Regulations stipulate that drones must remain at least five miles away from airports and below 400 feet in altitude, unless specific authorization is obtained.\n\nThe incident underscores the growing challenges in managing airspace shared by manned aircraft and unmanned aerial vehicles. Aviation authorities are grappling with the need to balance the burgeoning drone industry with the paramount importance of aviation safety. This near-miss is expected to fuel discussions about stricter regulations, enhanced drone tracking systems, and increased public awareness campaigns.\n"

Tim Lezard, from Stroud Labour Party, which organised the campaign, said it was \"a local service that people need\". But Paul Jennings, from Gloucestershire Care Services NHS Trust, said keeping it open was \"not practical\". Mr Jennings said: \"We're not in a position to provide an overnight service at Stroud and Cirencester minor injury units, that's why we've had to have so many closures over the last few months. \"We simply cannot recruit the staff to work those shifts.

Supporters argue that reducing the MIU's opening hours would place undue pressure on the already stretched A&E departments at larger hospitals, potentially leading to longer waiting times and compromised patient care.\n\nCampaigners emphasize the importance of the MIU for residents in rural areas, who may face significant travel distances to reach alternative healthcare facilities. They also point out that the MIU provides a valuable service for tourists and visitors, particularly during peak seasons.\n\nThe petition organizers have expressed concerns that any reduction in opening hours could disproportionately affect vulnerable populations, such as the elderly and those with limited mobility, who may rely on the MIU for prompt and convenient treatment.\n\nThe presentation of the petition to the county councillors is expected to be followed by a debate on the future of the MIU. Councillors will be asked to consider the potential impact of any changes to the unit's operating hours on the wider healthcare system and the local community.\n\nA spokesperson for the council has stated that all feedback received through the petition will be carefully considered as part of a wider review of healthcare services in the county.

Riots, looting and violence shook the city in the days following the black 25-year-old's death. The city will propose the settlement to its Board of Estimates on Wednesday. Gray was in the back of a prisoner transport van when he was injured. His death is of one of several involving black Americans and police which has spurred national debate, unrest and various social justice movements. Baltimore police have admitted he was not secured by a seatbelt, as required by law, and he was denied medical attention while in the van. The settlement would \"resolve all civil claims related to the City of Baltimore, the Baltimore Police Department, individual Baltimore Police offers and any other persons or institutions who might be deemed responsible for the death of Mr Gray,\" according to a statement from Baltimore Mayor Stephanie-Rawlings Blake. The payment does not resolve any \"factual disputes\" surrounding his death and does not admit liability or fault on the part of the city or the police department, the statement added. It is not a judgement on the guilt or innocence of the officers facing trial, said Ms Rawlings-Blake. The total payment being proposed for Gray's case is more than the total paid out by the city for more than 120 other lawsuits against the Baltimore Police Department since 2011, the Baltimore Sun newspaper reports.

He died a week later, igniting days of unrest in Baltimore and drawing national attention to issues of police brutality and racial inequality.\n\nThe proposed settlement does not constitute an admission of guilt or liability on the part of the city or the police officers involved. City officials stated that the decision to settle was made in the best interest of Baltimore, aiming to avoid prolonged and costly litigation.\n\nThe six officers involved in Gray's arrest and transport faced criminal charges ranging from manslaughter to second-degree murder. However, all officers were either acquitted or had their charges dropped.\n\nNews of the proposed settlement has elicited mixed reactions. Some community activists and Gray's supporters view it as a step towards accountability and justice, while others believe it is insufficient, arguing that it fails to address systemic issues within the Baltimore Police Department.\n\nThe settlement comes at a time when Baltimore continues to grapple with high rates of violent crime and ongoing concerns about police misconduct. The city has been under a federal consent decree since 2017, mandating reforms to the police department's policies and practices.\n\nThe Gray family's attorney expressed hope that the settlement would bring some measure of closure to the family and contribute to positive change in Baltimore. They also emphasized the importance of continued efforts to address police brutality and ensure equal justice for all.\n\nThe Board of Estimates is expected to vote on the proposed settlement in the coming weeks. If approved, the funds will be distributed to Gray's family members.

Mr Arce also said that while the land was under the control of local authorities, any subterranean riches were under the control of the national government. The minister said that if AngloGold Ashanti was awarded the environmental licence it needs to proceed with the project, the courts or Colombia's congress would have to decide whether the local or national authorities prevailed. Mr Arce insisted that the referendum vote would not affect foreign investment in Colombia's mining sector. \"For the first time in 20 years we will have three major projects in execution phase,\" he told RCN.

La Colosa, one of the largest gold deposits in Latin America, has been a contentious issue for years, pitting economic development against environmental concerns.\n\nMinister Arce’s recent remarks have ignited a fresh wave of debate surrounding the project's future. While acknowledging the democratic expression of the community, he questioned whether the referendum's outcome is legally binding and can definitively halt mining operations. He suggested a comprehensive legal review is necessary to determine the extent to which local referendums can supersede national mining regulations.\n\nThis stance has drawn criticism from environmental activists and local community leaders, who argue that the referendum clearly demonstrated the will of the people and should be respected. They contend that undermining the result would erode trust in democratic processes and pave the way for environmentally damaging projects against the wishes of affected communities.\n\nAngloGold Ashanti has maintained a relatively low profile since the referendum, but the company has not entirely abandoned its interest in the La Colosa deposit. The Minister's comments offer a glimmer of hope for the company, suggesting a potential avenue for revisiting the project, albeit one fraught with legal and social challenges.\n\nThe situation underscores the ongoing tension between resource extraction and community rights in Colombia, particularly in regions heavily reliant on agriculture and vulnerable to environmental degradation. The final determination of La Colosa's fate will likely set a precedent for future mining projects and the power of local referendums in shaping resource development policy.\n"

    "HWT": "Centre-back Fonte, 32, helped his country to Euro 2016 victory in July and has been linked with a move to Manchester United. \"It is important to keep Jose Fonte at Southampton,\" Puel said. \"He is a very important player for the team, a good player and I don't see that it is a possibility for him to leave us.\" Puel, who joined the club as successor to Ronald Koeman in June, believes many players in his squad will attract interest during the transfer window. \"It's no different for Jose Fonte than it is for other players,\" he said. \"I'm enjoying sitting down and working with this squad. \"The qualities are there, but there is also the spirit and attitude, which is encouraging for the future of Southampton.\" Puel will take charge of his first Premier League game at home to Watford on Saturday. The former Nice, Monaco and Lyon manager will be without England left-back Ryan Bertrand through injury, but is set to use summer signing Nathan Redmond in an attacking role. Puel said: \"Last season at Norwich, he often played out wide, but I think he is a very good striker. He can make different things happen. It's a good surprise for me, because he has real potential.\"",
    "MGT": "Southampton Football Club manager Claude Puel has moved to quash speculation surrounding the future of captain Jose Fonte, confirming the Portuguese international will remain at St. Mary's. Speaking after the Saints' pre-season friendly against Espanyol, Puel addressed rumors linking the Euro 2016 winner with a move away from the south coast club.\n\n\"Jose is a very important player for Southampton,\" Puel stated emphatically. \"He is our captain, and he will stay. I am very happy with his attitude and his work.\"\n\nFonte, 32, has been a mainstay in the Southampton defense since joining from Crystal Palace in 2010. He played a crucial role in the club's rise from League One to the Premier League and has consistently delivered solid performances. His leadership qualities have also been widely praised.\n\nRecent reports had suggested that several clubs, including Manchester United and Arsenal, were interested in acquiring the experienced center-back. Fonte's impressive performances for Portugal during their victorious Euro 2016 campaign further fueled these rumors.\n\nHowever, Puel's comments appear to have put an end to the speculation, providing reassurance to Southampton supporters. The manager emphasized the importance of maintaining stability within the squad as the club prepares for the upcoming Premier League season and their Europa League campaign.\n\n\"We need Jose's experience and quality,\" Puel added. \"He is a fantastic professional, and I am looking forward to working with him.\"\n\nThe news will be welcomed by Southampton fans who see Fonte as an integral part of the team. His continued presence will provide a sense of continuity and stability as the club embarks on a new era under Claude Puel.\n"

    "HWT": "Trailing 24-15 at the break, Newcastle scored four tries in 18 second-half minutes to turn the game around. Scrum-half Takulua crossed the line three times and also added another nine points with his boot off the tee. Northampton, who earned a bonus point of their own with four tries, were undone by a series of defensive and handling errors in the second half. A second successive home win for Newcastle lifts them above Northampton to seventh and just a point behind sixth-placed Harlequins. Northampton have now lost their past two Premiership matches to fall to eighth and are without an away win in six games in all competitions. Jim Mallinder's side made a terrific start with two tries inside the opening five minutes from Ken Pisi and Jamie Gibson. Harry Mallinder's score in the corner seemingly put them in charge at the break despite Takulua and Sean Robinson crossing for the hosts. But a lightning restart from Newcastle saw Rob Vickers and a Takulua brace change the complexion of the game within 10 minutes. Falcons went on to inflict further damage through hooker Kyle Cooper before Mikey Haywood kept Saints in the hunt, although Mark Wilson's late score from a rolling maul settled the affair. Newcastle: Tait; Goneva, Waldouck, Socino, Sinoti; Hodgson, Takulua; Vickers, Cooper, Welsh, Green, Robinson, Wilson, Welch (capt), Latu. Replacements: Lawson, Harris, Wilson, Fonua, Olmstead, Egerton, Delany, Watson. Northampton: Tuala; K. Pisi, Tuitavake, Mallinder, Foden (capt); Myler, Groom; A.

    "MGT": "Newcastle Falcons soared to a commanding victory against Northampton Saints at Kingston Park, fueled by a sensational hat-trick from scrum-half Sonatane Takulua. The Falcons dominated proceedings, showcasing a potent blend of attacking flair and resolute defense, leaving the Saints struggling to find answers.\n\nTakulua opened his account early in the first half, darting through a gap in the Northampton defense after sustained pressure from the Newcastle forwards. His sniping run and powerful finish set the tone for the afternoon, injecting confidence into the home side. Brett Connon added the extras, extending Newcastle's lead.\n\nNorthampton responded with a penalty from Fin Smith, but Newcastle quickly reasserted their dominance. The Falcons forwards were relentless at the breakdown, disrupting Northampton's rhythm and creating opportunities for their backs. A well-executed lineout move led to Newcastle's second try, with Adam Radwan touching down in the corner.\n\nTakulua secured his second try just before halftime, capitalizing on a turnover deep in Northampton territory. He showed incredible awareness to pick up the loose ball and sprint clear, leaving the Saints defenders trailing in his wake. Connon again added the conversion, giving Newcastle a comfortable lead at the break.\n\nThe second half saw Newcastle maintain their intensity, denying Northampton any chance of mounting a comeback. Their defensive line was impenetrable, and their attacking moves were incisive and well-coordinated. Takulua completed his hat-trick in spectacular fashion, intercepting a pass inside his own half and racing the length of the field to score. The Kingston Park crowd erupted in celebration, acknowledging the scrum-half's outstanding performance.\n\nNorthampton managed a late consolation try through Tom James, but it did little to dampen the spirits of the Newcastle faithful. The Falcons closed out the game with composure, securing a well-deserved victory. The final score reflected Newcastle's dominance, leaving Northampton to reflect on a disappointing performance. This win marks a significant step forward for Newcastle, showcasing their potential to compete with the top teams in the league.\n"

    "prompt": "Anyone lucky enough to have a £50 note in their wallet or purse will find it is the only banknote made of paper in a few years.",
    "HWT": "The Bank of England has announced that the next design of the £20 note will be plastic. The new £20 note, entering circulation in 2020, will follow the polymer £5 and £10 notes. Consumers will be able to get their hands on the new plastic £5 note, the first in the polymer series, from 2016. This will feature the image of Sir Winston Churchill. The Bank argues that the polymer notes stay cleaner and are more secure than cotton paper notes, which have been used for more than 100 years. The £5 polymer note will enter circulation in the autumn of 2016, followed by the Jane Austen plastic £10 note a year later. The Bank said that the decision for the £20 note to also be made from polymer came after \"extensive research into the developments in security features\". On a more practical level for many consumers, it will also survive a spin in the washing machine. A bank committee is considering which character will appear on the new £20 note. It received 29,701 nominations from the public after it announced it wanted to celebrate an artist on the note. Some 592 eligible visual artists are being considered for the honour. The final decision will be made by the Bank's governor, Mark Carney. Favourites include the sculptor and artist Barbara Hepworth, the author Beatrix Potter and fashion designer Alexander McQueen. Whoever wins will replace the economist Adam Smith on the current £20 note. The next £50 could also be made of plastic, but it will be some time before that decision is made. The latest version of the note, featuring Matthew Boulton and James Watt, only entered circulation in November 2011. Clydesdale Bank in Scotland has issued a limited number of polymer notes. In 1999, Northern Bank of Northern Ireland issued a polymer £5 commemorative note celebrating the year 2000. A plastic note was introduced in the Isle of Man in 1983 but was withdrawn in 1988 owing to problems with the ink.",
    "MGT": "The Bank of England has confirmed that the £50 note will soon be the last remaining paper banknote in circulation, marking the end of an era for traditional currency. With the phasing out of paper £20 notes completed last year and the earlier removal of £5 and £10 paper notes, the polymer £50 will stand alone as the sole representation of the older currency format.\n\nThis transition signifies a major shift in the Bank of England's approach to banknote production, driven by the enhanced security features and durability offered by polymer. Polymer notes are demonstrably more resistant to wear and tear, lasting significantly longer than their paper counterparts. They are also more difficult to counterfeit, incorporating advanced holographic images and security threads that are challenging for forgers to replicate.\n\nThe move to polymer has been a gradual process, beginning with the introduction of the polymer £5 note featuring Winston Churchill in 2016. This was followed by the polymer £10 note featuring Jane Austen in 2017 and the polymer £20 note featuring J.M.W. Turner in 2020. The current polymer £50 note, featuring Alan Turing, was introduced in 2021.\n\nWhile the older paper notes are no longer legal tender, they can still be exchanged for polymer notes at the Bank of England. Many commercial banks may also accept them, though this is at their discretion. The Bank of England encourages individuals holding paper notes to exchange them to avoid any inconvenience.\n\nThe decision to phase out paper notes has not been without its critics. Some argue that the polymer notes lack the tactile feel of traditional paper currency, while others express concerns about the environmental impact of producing polymer. However, the Bank of England maintains that the benefits of polymer in terms of security and durability outweigh these concerns.\n\nAs the polymer £50 note becomes the last paper banknote standing, it serves as a reminder of the evolution of currency and the ongoing efforts to combat counterfeiting. While the feel of paper money may soon be a distant memory for most, the enhanced security and longevity of polymer notes are expected to provide a more secure and reliable form of currency for the future.\n"

Gale and Adam Milner extended the lead before Ryan Brierley hit back. Two more tries from Gale in a 24-point contribution and a Monaghan treble followed as Tigers dominated. While Lee Gaskell added a further consolation try for Huddersfield in the second half, it did little more than add a semblance of respectability to the scoreline as they became the latest club to suffer a heavy loss at the Jungle. Castleford have scored at least 43 points in each of their first four home games in Super League this season. However, they were left to bemoan a series of handling errors after Hinchcliffe's try put Huddersfield ahead. That was before Roberts scooped up a neat grubber kick by Gale to help put the hosts ahead after 21 minutes. Huddersfield then saw their restart go out on the full, allowing Roberts the chance to quickly play provider for Webster as Tigers piled the points on. Gale gave Daryl Powell's side the ideal start to the second half, crossing for the first of his tries after just 30 seconds, as Castleford went on to win big to remain top. They are level on points with Leeds Rhinos, who beat Wigan 26-18 in Friday's other Super League game.

    "MGT": "Castleford Tigers showcased their dominance in the Super League with a resounding victory over the struggling Huddersfield Giants. The league leaders delivered a commanding performance, particularly in the second half, to secure a comfortable win.\n\nThe Giants, desperate for points to climb away from the foot of the table, initially put up a fight. However, Castleford's relentless pressure and clinical finishing ultimately proved too much for the home side to handle.\n\nThe match remained relatively close in the first half, with both teams exchanging blows. But after the restart, Castleford unleashed their full attacking potential, leaving Huddersfield reeling. Luke Gale, the influential half-back, orchestrated the Tigers' offensive onslaught, while winger Joel Monaghan proved to be a constant threat with his speed and agility.\n\nGale's kicking game was instrumental in pinning Huddersfield back in their own territory, creating opportunities for his teammates to exploit. His vision and distribution skills were on full display as he masterfully guided Castleford's attack.\n\nMonaghan, on the other hand, showcased his finishing prowess with three well-taken tries. His ability to find space and beat defenders made him a nightmare for the Huddersfield defense. Both Gale and Monaghan completed second-half hat-tricks, a testament to Castleford's attacking firepower.\n\nThe Giants struggled to contain Castleford's dynamic attack, and their defense eventually crumbled under the constant pressure. They were unable to match the Tigers' intensity and lacked the creativity to unlock the visitors' defense.\n\nCastleford's victory further solidifies their position at the top of the Super League table, while Huddersfield's woes continue. The Tigers have emerged as genuine title contenders, and their performance against the Giants demonstrated their ability to dismantle opponents with ruthless efficiency. The Giants, meanwhile, face an uphill battle to avoid relegation. They need to find a way to improve their defense and add more firepower to their attack if they are to turn their season around.\n"

    "HWT": "He was responding to a question by MP Dominic Grieve about the Heathrow spur. Mr McLoughlin said: \"I would now like to make clear that we do not intend to build the spur as part of Phase 1 or 2 of the HS2 scheme\". HS2 is a planned high-speed rail network from London to Birmingham, Manchester and Leeds. Previously the government had said any decision about the Heathrow spur would be delayed until the Davies Commission's report on future UK airport capacity had been completed. Responding to Mr Grieve's written Parliamentary question, the minister cited the Airports Commission review findings - published in November - which \"indicated that an HS2 spur is highly unlikely to be necessary to support any expansion of Heathrow airport\". Nick Hurd, Conservative MP for Ruislip, Northwood and Pinner tweeted he was \"delighted\" the government had dropped the idea and gave \"credit to ministers for listening to our argument\". He said the best way of connecting passengers to Heathrow was via Old Oak Common. He said it also simplified the case for extending the HS2 tunnel to protect Ickenham and Colne Valley. Paul Prentice, assistant news editor at Rail magazine said it was a \"very sensible decision. Bearing in mind there is already a spur tunnel to Heathrow and another western link being built\". Campaigner Lottie Jones from Hillingdon Against HS2 said the group was \"delighted\" with the decision but cautious that it was not \"just a pre-election sweetener\" that might be revoked.",
    "MGT": "The government has scrapped plans for a direct rail link to Heathrow Airport via the HS2 high-speed rail network. Transport Minister Patrick McLoughlin confirmed the decision, effectively ending years of speculation about the potential connection.\n\nThe proposed link, initially envisioned as a spur off the main HS2 line, was intended to improve connectivity to the UK's busiest airport, facilitating quicker and more efficient travel for passengers across the country. Proponents argued the connection would alleviate pressure on existing transport infrastructure and boost economic growth in regions served by HS2.\n\nHowever, McLoughlin cited concerns over cost and complexity as primary factors in the decision. He suggested that the project's projected budget had ballooned significantly, making it financially unviable. Furthermore, the integration of the Heathrow spur into the existing HS2 plans presented substantial engineering challenges that could have jeopardized the overall timeline and budget of the high-speed rail project.\n\nInstead, the government is reportedly exploring alternative options to enhance rail access to Heathrow. These include improvements to existing rail lines and potential upgrades to the Elizabeth Line, also known as Crossrail, which already provides a direct link between Heathrow and central London.\n\nThe decision has drawn criticism from some business groups and aviation industry representatives, who argue that a direct HS2 link would have been a significant asset for the airport and the wider economy. They claim the government has missed an opportunity to create a truly integrated transport network. Supporters of the decision, however, maintain that prioritizing the core HS2 project is essential to ensure its successful completion and that alternative solutions can effectively address Heathrow's connectivity needs. The focus will now shift to developing and implementing these alternative plans to improve rail access to the airport.\n"

The results are big turnaround for the firm that has seen years of losses and undergone a restructuring, which has resulted in job cuts and asset sales. Its first half restructuring charges were down 35% at 15.7bn yen.

Expecting to sell more PS4 consoles, Sony left its forecast for earnings for the year ending in March 2016 unchanged. \"Sales are expected to be higher than the July forecast primarily due to an expected increase in PS4 hardware unit sales and PS4 software sales,\" the company said.

    "HWT": "Charlie Elphicke, Conservative MP for Dover and Deal, said Shepway District Council supported the plans for a smaller lorry park at Westenhanger. The council's leader had previously branded a proposed 3,300-space lorry park as \"bonkers\". Lorries are allowed to park on the M20 when there are delays at Channel ports. The proposed lorry park is aimed at relieving pressure caused by Operation Stack, when trucks are allowed to queue due to delays at Channel Tunnel and ferry ports. Mr Elphicke said: \"We've had major problems in Dover in recent months because of the level of gridlock, which is a weekly occurrence. \"We need a long term solution. There is a site near Folkestone which could be the site with up to 1,000 lorry parking spaces. \"[Shepway] District Council is supportive and I'm making the case it should be advance check-in, before lorries go down to the Eastern Docks. \"There would be 1,000 spaces in the Eastern Docks and 1,000 spaces near Folkestone which would be enough capacity not to cause gridlock in Dover.\" A spokeswoman said Shepway council was \"driving plans\" for a lorry park with about 1,000 spaces. She said the authority was looking at land near Westenhanger and was talking to local land owners. Councillor Paul Carter, Conservative leader of Kent County Council, said problems arising from Operation Stack were \"intolerable\" to the people of Kent. He said: \"We need national government to fund what is needed to get the private sector to operate those lorry parks. \"Recently, the government introduced charging for foreign lorries using our roads, and I believe a substantial amount of the money should be used to fund these lorry parks.\"",
    "MGT": "A new lorry park aimed at alleviating traffic congestion caused by queuing lorries on the M20 and in Dover is gaining local support, according to a local Member of Parliament. The proposed facility, boasting 1,000 spaces, is intended to provide a secure and designated area for lorries awaiting channel crossings, thereby reducing the impact on local roads and communities.\n\nFor years, the M20 has been plagued by the issue of lorries stacking up during periods of disruption or high demand at the Port of Dover and the Eurotunnel. This congestion not only disrupts the flow of traffic for other motorists but also poses significant challenges for local residents and businesses. The new lorry park is envisioned as a crucial piece of infrastructure to mitigate these problems.\n\nThe MP emphasized the importance of collaboration between local authorities, transport agencies, and the private sector to ensure the successful development and operation of the facility. They also highlighted the potential economic benefits of the lorry park, including the creation of jobs and the provision of services for lorry drivers.\n\nThe location of the proposed lorry park has been carefully considered to minimize environmental impact and disruption to local communities. Environmental assessments are being carried out to ensure that the project adheres to the highest standards of sustainability.\n\nThe initiative has been welcomed by local businesses, who have long suffered from the negative effects of lorry congestion. They believe that the new facility will help to improve the efficiency of supply chains and reduce the costs associated with delays.\n\nWhile the project has garnered widespread support, some concerns have been raised regarding the potential impact on local infrastructure and services. Authorities have pledged to address these concerns through ongoing consultation and collaboration with local communities.\n\nThe development of the lorry park is seen as a vital step in ensuring the smooth flow of trade and traffic through the Port of Dover, a critical gateway for goods and passengers between the UK and Europe. The project is expected to be completed within the next two years.\n"

    "HWT": "The England coach has picked United's Marcus Rashford, 19, in his squad. The teenage striker will now miss the Under-21 European Championship this summer - something Mourinho wanted. \"I'm not in a position where I can make decisions to keep people happy. I'm not going to achieve that,\" said Southgate. \"The key is not the relationship with Jose, it's the relationship with Marcus. I didn't speak to him [Mourinho] about it. I let him know where I was heading at the end.\" Mourinho said last month Rashford should not go to the Euros as \"it does not make a lot of sense to drop levels\". The FA previously indicated young players needed tournament experience. Rashford has instead been called up for the World Cup qualifier against Scotland on 10 June and the friendly against France three days later. He played 58 games for United and England this season, scoring 11 goals, having broken into his club's first-team last term. Just four months into his first professional season in February 2016, he was selected for Euro 2016 by England manager Roy Hodgson and has gone on to win eight caps. Rashford led the line in United's Europa League final win over Ajax and came on in the EFL Cup final triumph over Southampton. Southgate said he \"wants a good working relationship with the clubs\" but has to make decisions \"that are right for England\". The former international defender added: \"I have got to make decisions that are right for England seniors long term, I'm always mindful of what is right for the players. \"Respectfully, none of the managers are going to be around in 10 years, or it's very, very unlikely, and I think people like Marcus Rashford will be. \"So there's always going to be some collision at some point on that and some disagreement on that.\"",

Southgate acknowledged the challenges inherent in attempting to satisfy Mourinho, suggesting that such an endeavor would be \"fairly difficult.\"\n\nThe England manager’s comments come amidst ongoing discussions about the availability and usage of players across club and international levels. While Southgate did not explicitly reference any specific instances, it’s widely understood that the fitness and playing time of Manchester United players within the England setup have been a recurring topic.\n\nSouthgate stressed that his primary focus remains on making choices that benefit England's performance and long-term development. He underscored his responsibility to the nation, stating that he would not compromise his judgment to cater to the preferences of individual club managers.\n\n\"My job is to make the decisions that are right for England,\" Southgate affirmed, signaling a clear stance on his autonomy in squad selection and tactical approaches. He acknowledged the importance of maintaining open communication with club managers, but ultimately reiterated that his allegiance lies with the national team.\n\nThe dynamic between national team managers and club managers is often fraught with tension, as both entities strive to optimize player performance while protecting against potential burnout or injury. Southgate's remarks highlight the delicate balance he must strike in navigating these competing interests.\n\nHe recognizes the pressure from various stakeholders, including clubs, fans, and the media. However, he remains steadfast in his commitment to making independent evaluations based on his assessment of players' form, fitness, and suitability for the England squad.\n\nSouthgate's firm position suggests a willingness to withstand potential criticism or disagreement from club managers, including Mourinho. He appears determined to uphold his principles and prioritize the objectives of the England national team, regardless of external pressures. This approach reflects his confidence in his own judgment and his dedication to leading England to success on the international stage.\n"

    "HWT": "Volodymyr Demchyshyn said on Wednesday that one of the reactors at the Zaporizhzhya plant in the south of Ukraine had automatically shut down. There was no problem with the reactor itself and the problem would be fixed by the weekend, he added. Zaporizhzhya produces more than one-fifth of Ukraine's electricity. The operator of the nuclear plant, Energoatom, had reported a problem with the power plant on Friday. But the details were not fully disclosed until a cabinet meeting on Wednesday when Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk asked the energy minister to report on what had happened. Mr Demchyshyn said that damage to a transformer in a power-generating unit had triggered an automatic shutdown of one of the six 1,000 MW reactors. He added that there was \"no threat\" to the safety of the reactor. The French Institute for Radiological Protection and Nuclear Safety (IRSN) told Reuters that their sensors had not detected anything unusual in Ukraine. Michel Chouha, IRSN's special representative for Central and Eastern Europe, said: \"If there was an accident, we would know.\" The drop in electricity production has left several dozen towns and villages without electricity, Russian media reported. Ukraine's energy industry is already under pressure because of a fuel shortage. Mr Demchyshyn said that Ukraine will probably have to import power from Russia this winter. He called it a \"necessary step\" despite how \"politically problematic it might be\". Last year Ukraine was self-sufficient in electricity but the conflict with pro-Russian rebels in the east of the country has severely hit coal production.

Galushchenko assured the public that the incident poses no immediate threat to safety or the surrounding environment.\n\n\"We are aware of the situation at the Zaporizhzhia plant,\" Galushchenko stated in a brief press conference. \"A technical fault has led to a reduction in power generation. However, I want to emphasize that all safety protocols are being followed, and there is no indication of any radiation release or danger to the public.\"\n\nThe minister did not elaborate on the specific nature of the technical fault, citing ongoing investigations. He did, however, confirm that experts are on-site working to resolve the issue and restore the plant to full operational capacity as quickly as possible.\n\nThe Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, located in southeastern Ukraine, is a crucial component of the nation's energy infrastructure, supplying a significant portion of the country's electricity. The temporary reduction in output is expected to have some impact on the national grid, but Galushchenko assured that contingency plans are in place to mitigate any potential disruptions.\n\n\"We have alternative sources of power available to compensate for the reduced output from Zaporizhzhia,\" he explained. \"We are working to ensure a stable and reliable electricity supply for all Ukrainian consumers.\"\n\nThe incident comes at a sensitive time, as Ukraine continues to navigate a complex energy landscape. The government has been actively working to modernize its energy infrastructure and diversify its energy sources.\n\nThe International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has been informed of the situation and is closely monitoring developments. The IAEA has expressed its confidence in Ukraine's ability to manage the situation safely and effectively.\n\nFurther updates will be provided as more information becomes available.

    "HWT": "The Social Liberal Union (USL) won nearly 60% of the vote, with four-fifths of ballots counted. The Right Romania Alliance (ARD) of centre-right President Traian Basescu came a distant second with about 17%. The result could open the door to a constitutional crisis, as the president has previously hinted he may refuse to reappoint his arch-rival Mr Ponta. Mr Ponta said: \"This is a clear victory with an absolute majority.\" But, if he resumes as prime minister, he will have to share power with Mr Basescu, whose term runs until 2014. The pair have been locked in a power struggle since Mr Ponta came to power in April following the collapse of the previous centre-right government. The two men have argued over control of state television and the Romanian Cultural Institute and attempts to draw up a new electoral law. But, says the BBC's correspondent in the region Nick Thorpe, the political feud often seems to have more to do with the vanity of the main players than with genuine differences in policy. Their antagonism has meant political decision-making has at times been paralysed. In July, Mr Ponta suspended Mr Basescu and tried to impeach him. But a referendum failed to meet the required turnout. Mr Basescu hinted before the election that he might refuse to re-appoint Mr Ponta as prime minister. He has described him as a \"mythomaniac\". Mr Basescu's popularity has plummeted since he introduced stringent austerity measures and a 25% cut in public sector pay. Romania is the second poorest member of the European Union, which it joined in 2007 with Bulgaria. The country, together with neighbour Bulgaria, are under special EU monitoring because of concerns about judicial independence, corruption and political influence in state institutions. Romania is trying to negotiate a new loan from the IMF to replace the existing one which expires early next year.",
    "MGT": "Romania's political landscape has undergone a significant shift as the centre-left coalition, led by Prime Minister Victor Ponta, secured a resounding victory in the nation's general election. The outcome, widely anticipated by many political analysts, solidifies Ponta's position at the helm of the Romanian government and paves the way for the implementation of his coalition's policy agenda.\n\nThe election, held on Sunday, witnessed a high voter turnout, reflecting the deep engagement of the Romanian populace in shaping the future direction of their country. Throughout the campaign, Ponta's coalition emphasized its commitment to economic growth, job creation, and social welfare programs, resonating with a significant portion of the electorate.\n\nWhile official results are still being finalized, preliminary data indicates a substantial lead for the centre-left coalition over its main rivals, the centre-right opposition. The victory marks a continuation of Ponta's leadership, which has been characterized by a focus on attracting foreign investment and fostering closer ties with European Union partners.\n\nThe election results have been met with mixed reactions across the country. Supporters of the centre-left coalition have celebrated the victory, expressing optimism about the future prospects of Romania under Ponta's continued governance. However, opposition parties have voiced concerns about the potential implications of the outcome, raising questions about the balance of power and the representation of diverse political viewpoints.\n\nIn the coming days, Prime Minister Ponta is expected to outline his government's priorities for the next term, addressing key challenges such as healthcare reform, infrastructure development, and combating corruption. The coalition's ability to deliver on its promises will be closely scrutinized by the public and the international community alike.\n\nAs Romania embarks on this new chapter, the focus will be on the government's ability to navigate complex economic and social issues, while ensuring political stability and upholding democratic values. The election outcome represents a significant mandate for the centre-left coalition, but also carries the responsibility of addressing the diverse needs and aspirations of the Romanian people.\n"

    "HWT": "Peers voted by 327 to 234, to give a majority of 93 to a Labour motion forcing the plans to be debated by a cross party select committee. Labour fears it could lose Â£6m a year under the Trade Union Bill proposals. Labour's Baroness Smith of Basildon rejected government claims the bill would not hurt her party financially. She told peers democracy would be damaged if the government pushed through the changes on funding without them being scrutinised by a select committee first. As it stands, the legislation would require Labour-affiliated union members to \"opt in\" to paying a levy to the party instead of having it automatically deducted. Lady Smith said: \"Our genuinely held concern is that this aspect of the bill will have a significant impact on the resources of one major political party - my party, the Labour Party. \"And in doing so, it will both disrupt the political balance in the UK and have a damaging effect on the electoral process and our democracy.\" Conservative and Lib Dem peers suggested the government should rethink its proposals. Tory peer Lord Forsyth said: \"It will take away funding from the Labour Party at a time when the Labour Party is perhaps not at its strongest... our Parliamentary system does depend upon having a strong and effective opposition.\" Labour is also reported to be set to lose out by about Â£1.3m a year when state funding for opposition parties - known as Short money - is cut. Junior business minister Baroness Neville-Rolfe, responding for the government, said Labour's motion would shift the focus of scrutiny on the Bill to party funding and away from its central purpose of trade union reform. She added: \"This Bill is a package of measures and it's disappointing that the party opposite has chosen to misinterpret our intentions.\"",
    "MGT": "The government's proposed restrictions on trade union funding of political parties are facing renewed scrutiny after a setback in the House of Lords. Peers have voiced concerns that the measures, intended to ensure transparency and accountability in political financing, could disproportionately impact the ability of unions to engage in legitimate political activities.\n\nThe proposed legislation seeks to alter the existing framework for political donations, imposing stricter requirements on unions regarding member consent and the allocation of funds for political purposes. Supporters of the bill argue that it will safeguard members' contributions and prevent funds from being used for political causes without explicit endorsement.\n\nHowever, critics contend that the legislation is a thinly veiled attempt to weaken the financial standing of opposition parties, particularly the Labour Party, which traditionally receives significant funding from trade unions. They argue that the new requirements would place an undue administrative burden on unions, making it more difficult for them to participate in the political process and advocate for their members' interests.\n\nDuring the debate in the Lords, several peers raised concerns about the potential chilling effect on freedom of association and the right to political expression. They questioned whether the proposed restrictions were proportionate to the stated aim of enhancing transparency, suggesting that existing regulations already provided adequate safeguards.\n\nThe defeat in the Lords now compels the government to reconsider its approach. It has several options, including revising the bill to address the concerns raised by peers, attempting to overturn the Lords' decision in the House of Commons, or abandoning the legislation altogether.\n\nThe outcome remains uncertain, but the setback in the Lords underscores the contentious nature of the issue and the potential for significant opposition to the government's plans. The debate over trade union funding of political parties is likely to continue, with both sides digging in for a protracted battle. The implications of any changes to the existing framework could be far-reaching, affecting the balance of power in British politics and the ability of unions to represent their members' interests effectively.\n"

Officials estimate that almost 900 people in total have so far left Germany to join IS in Syria or Iraq. \"The message to the radical Islamist scene is clear: we do not tolerate fanatics who try to radicalise young people and send them to jihad,\" said Peter Beuth, interior minister for Hesse state, where some of the raids took place. \"By banning this organisation, a major source of radicalisation has been eradicated nationwide. Those who spread hate messages can't hide behind freedom of religion.\"",
    "MGT": "German police conducted extensive nationwide raids early this morning targeting locations linked to a suspected Islamist organization. Over 200 mosques, apartments, and offices across multiple states were searched as part of the coordinated operation. Authorities confirmed the raids were aimed at gathering evidence against individuals allegedly associated with the group, which is suspected of extremist activities.\n\nLaw enforcement officials stated the investigation is focused on individuals believed to be promoting radical ideologies and potentially recruiting individuals to support extremist causes. While no immediate arrests were made, a significant amount of material, including electronic devices and documents, was seized for further analysis.\n\nThe operation involved hundreds of officers from various police units, highlighting the scale and seriousness of the investigation. Security officials emphasized the importance of taking decisive action against any groups that pose a threat to Germany's democratic values and security. The investigation is ongoing, and authorities have not yet released further details about the specific allegations against the individuals targeted in the raids.\n"

    "HWT": "South Lakes Safari Zoo in Dalton said it would be closed from 9 January. Barrow Borough Council raised several concerns about the zoo, including the closeness of the rhino dung to a fence, and the safety of walkways. Zoo bosses said they felt \"harassed\" by the council and were unable to continue under such conditions. On Thursday Barrow Council's licensing committee issued an order to the zoo to prove within 28 days that the aerial walkways were safe. Zoo inspector Matthew Brash showed the council pictures of rotting timbers and said he and his colleagues had noted 20 slips and trips on them from the zoo's accident book. But Karen Brewer, from the zoo, said there was only one accident listed in 2015 and two in 2014. The council also said a pile of rhino dung was too close to a fence, providing a possible escape route for baboons, although the zoo said there had never been a baboon escape in 16 years of the dung being piled there. In a statement, the zoo said: \"We assure everyone that the zoo is safe and there is no evidence whatsoever to say otherwise. \"We are being subjected to an unprecedented attack and attempt to undermine our credibility and professionalism at every chance created. \"The management team cannot work under these conditions and hence the decisions made.\"",
    "MGT": "Barrow-in-Furness, Cumbria - A local zoo is set to close its doors permanently following a decision by the local council to revoke its license. The decision was made after a tense meeting where councillors cited multiple concerns, including the potential for baboons to escape the facility.\n\nThe unusual concern regarding primate escape centered around a large accumulation of rhinoceros dung within the zoo's perimeter. Councillors argued that the strategically placed pile of excrement could provide the baboons with an elevated platform, enabling them to scale the enclosure walls.\n\nAdditional concerns were raised regarding the overall condition of the zoo and its compliance with safety regulations. Inspectors had previously identified issues with fencing integrity, staff training, and emergency procedures. The council stated that these shortcomings, coupled with the specific baboon escape risk, led them to conclude that the zoo could no longer operate safely and responsibly.\n\nZoo management expressed disappointment with the council's decision, arguing that the rhino dung posed no credible threat. They maintained that the baboon enclosure was secure and regularly inspected. Furthermore, they claimed to be actively addressing the other issues raised by inspectors.\n\nThe closure will result in the relocation of numerous animals to other zoos and sanctuaries across the country. The council has pledged to work with the zoo to ensure the animals' welfare during the transition. The future of the zoo site remains uncertain, but local residents are hopeful that it can be repurposed for community use. The zoo's last day of operation is scheduled for the end of the month.\n"

In their past 17 meetings with the other top-six sides away from home, Pochettino's team have won just once. \"In the first 45 minutes you saw a team that is not ready to fight for the Premier League,\" the Argentine told BT Sport. \"We are in a position that is up to us. But if you show like today that you cannot cope with the pressure then it is difficult to challenge and fight for the Premier League.\" Former Liverpool and Spurs midfielder Danny Murphy on Match of the Day \"I couldn't believe what I was watching, they had the best defensive record last season and the joint best this year, but they were all over the place. Against the big sides they have played with a back three but they had a back four today, but I think they should have stuck with what they have done against the big sides - play with a three. \"It was so unlike Spurs, they do so well at home, but the contrast is amazing.

    "MGT": "Tottenham Hotspur manager Mauricio Pochettino has criticized his team's first-half performance in their 2-0 defeat to Liverpool at Anfield, suggesting a \"lack of desire\" hampered their chances of challenging for the Premier League title. The Argentine coach expressed his disappointment with the team's intensity and commitment during the opening 45 minutes, a period in which Liverpool dominated possession and created several scoring opportunities.\n\nSpurs struggled to gain a foothold in the game from the outset, appearing sluggish and unable to match Liverpool's energy and pressing. The home side capitalized on Tottenham's lackluster start, taking the lead through a well-worked move. Pochettino lamented his side's inability to compete physically and mentally, highlighting the importance of maintaining a high level of motivation throughout the entire season.\n\n\"It is so important to show desire from the beginning,\" Pochettino stated after the match. \"We didn't show that in the first half. We need to be more aggressive and show more hunger to win.\"\n\nHe acknowledged Liverpool's quality and their impressive home form but insisted that his team could have performed much better. He stressed the need for his players to learn from the experience and to demonstrate a greater sense of urgency in future matches.\n\nThe defeat leaves Tottenham further adrift of the top four, increasing the pressure on Pochettino to turn their season around. While acknowledging the team's recent struggles, the manager remains confident in their ability to bounce back and secure a Champions League spot. He emphasized the importance of unity and hard work, urging his players to remain focused and committed to their goals.\n\nPochettino faces a difficult task in addressing the underlying issues that have plagued Tottenham's performances this season. The team's inconsistency and lack of cutting edge in attack have been a cause for concern, and the manager will need to find solutions to reignite their spark and restore their confidence.\n\nThe upcoming matches will be crucial for Tottenham as they look to regain momentum and prove their credentials as a top-four contender. Pochettino is determined to instill a renewed sense of belief and determination in his players, emphasizing the importance of playing with passion and desire in every game.\n"

    "HWT": "She was attacked outside a women's hostel in Lucknow while getting water from a hand pump, police said. The woman, 35, had been receiving round-the-clock police protection because of the previous attacks, which were linked to a property dispute. Anger is growing at the authorities' inability to protect her. She was allegedly gang-raped and first attacked with acid by two men in 2008, over a property dispute, the details of which are not clear. The same two men are then accused of throwing acid at her twice more - in 2012 and 2013 - to try and get her to drop the criminal charges against them. In March, she was attacked again while travelling on a train with her daughter. This time she was forced to drink acid. Two men are facing trial for all of the attacks but were released on bail in April, the AFP agency reports. According to government figures, there are hundreds of such attacks involving acid each year in India, although campaigners say the real figures are much higher. The victims, who have to live with terrible disfigurements, are mainly women and are often targeted by jealous partners, campaigners say. Despite a Supreme Court ruling in 2013 to regulate the sale of acid, critics say it is still widely and easily available.",

The woman, a survivor of an alleged gang-rape and four previous acid attacks, is currently receiving medical treatment for her injuries.\n\nThe incident occurred Monday evening while the woman was returning home from work. An unidentified assailant allegedly threw acid on her, causing burns to her face and neck.\n\nLocal police have launched an investigation into the attack, but no arrests have been made. Authorities have stated they are reviewing security footage from the area and interviewing potential witnesses to identify the perpetrator and determine the motive behind the latest assault.\n\nThe woman's case has drawn widespread condemnation from human rights organizations and activists, who are calling for greater protection for victims of sexual violence and acid attacks in India. They argue that the repeated targeting of this woman highlights the systemic failures in the justice system and the need for more effective measures to prevent such crimes.\n\nAcid attacks, often motivated by revenge or jealousy, are a serious problem in India, particularly affecting women. The corrosive nature of acid can cause severe disfigurement, blindness, and psychological trauma. While laws have been enacted to regulate the sale of acid and increase penalties for perpetrators, enforcement remains a challenge.\n\nThe latest attack on this woman has reignited calls for stricter regulations, faster trials, and better support for survivors. Advocates are urging the government to take concrete steps to ensure the safety and well-being of vulnerable individuals and to send a strong message that such acts of violence will not be tolerated.\n"

    "HWT": "Russia's FBI-style Investigative Committee (SK) confined him to Moscow after questioning him about an alleged plot to seize power in Russia. Mr Udaltsov denied the allegations and said a \"new repression\" was under way. Elsewhere, President Vladimir Putin sacked one of his ministers after publicly criticising him last month. No reason was given for dismissing Regional Development Minister Oleg Govorun and replacing him with Igor Slyunyayev. However, last month, in a dressing-down broadcast on TV, the Russian leader rebuked Mr Govorun for failing to deliver on his election promises to help people living in sub-standard housing in the regions. An unnamed Kremlin source quoted by Russian business newspaper Vedomosti said the main reason for Mr Putin's dissatisfaction was Mr Govorun's poor handling of the Krymsk flood disaster clean-up. Along with Mr Udaltsov, at least two other people were also placed under investigation by the SK. In Twitter messages, Mr Udaltsov, a radical leftist, said his apartment had been searched and he had been taken to SK headquarters for interrogation. \"This is lawlessness and provocation and I hope that society will not be silent,\" he was quoted as saying by Russia's Interfax news agency. A documentary last week on Russia's NTV channel, which is seen as close to the Kremlin, showed what it said was footage of the activist meeting officials from Georgia to discuss mounting a coup in Russia. In a statement released on Wednesday, the SK said it had begun an investigation into Mr Udaltsov, Leonid Razvozzhayev, Konstantin Lebedev and others on the basis of the allegations made in the documentary, Anatomy Of A Protest II. If convicted, Mr Udaltsov and the others face prison sentences of between four and 10 years. Correction, 19 October 2012:This story originally said that Mr Udaltsov had been placed under house arrest but it has now been clarified that he has been barred from leaving Moscow.",
    "MGT": "Moscow – Sergei Udaltsov, a prominent figure in Russia’s opposition movement, has been barred from leaving the country, his lawyer confirmed earlier today. The travel ban, imposed by investigators in Moscow, is the latest development in a long-running saga of legal pressure against Udaltsov and his allies.\n\nUdaltsov, known for his fiery rhetoric and organizational skills, has been a key player in anti-government demonstrations for over a decade. He has consistently challenged the policies of President Vladimir Putin and the ruling United Russia party, advocating for greater democratic freedoms and social justice. His activism has made him a frequent target of the authorities.\n\nThe specific reasons for the travel ban remain somewhat unclear, although sources close to the investigation suggest it is connected to a previous suspended sentence Udaltsov received in 2012. This sentence stemmed from his involvement in mass protests that erupted following allegations of widespread fraud in parliamentary elections. While Udaltsov has maintained his innocence, the conviction has continued to cast a shadow over his political activities.\n\nThe travel ban effectively prevents Udaltsov from participating in international forums and conferences, limiting his ability to advocate for his political views on a global stage. It also raises concerns among his supporters about a potential escalation of legal action against him.\n\n\"This is a clear attempt to silence a leading voice of dissent,\" said a statement released by the Left Front, the socialist political organization Udaltsov leads. \"The authorities are using the legal system to stifle opposition and prevent Sergei from engaging in legitimate political activity.\"\n\nThe Kremlin has so far declined to comment on the specific case, but officials have repeatedly defended the government's actions as necessary to maintain stability and prevent extremism. State-controlled media outlets have often portrayed Udaltsov and other opposition figures as agents of foreign influence, seeking to destabilize Russia.\n\nThe travel ban comes at a time of heightened political tension in Russia, with parliamentary elections scheduled for later this year. The opposition faces numerous challenges, including restrictions on public gatherings, limited access to media coverage, and allegations of harassment and intimidation. The Udaltsov case is likely to further exacerbate these concerns and raise questions about the fairness of the electoral process.\n"

He claimed that he had arranged for a third party to dispose of the waste responsibly, but the prosecution argued that he failed to ensure the waste was disposed of legally.\n\nThe court heard evidence from witnesses who identified a vehicle similar to Holley's van at the site of the fly-tipping. CCTV footage also placed the vehicle in the vicinity around the time of the incident.\n\nFollowing a two-day trial, District Judge Neil Thomas delivered a guilty verdict. He stated that the evidence presented by the prosecution was compelling and that he was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Holley was responsible for the fly-tipping.\n\nHolley expressed disappointment with the verdict, maintaining his innocence. He is considering an appeal. Sentencing has been adjourned until next month, allowing time for pre-sentence reports to be prepared.

They stated that the journalist, known for their critical reporting on both the Syrian and Turkish governments, was likely targeted for their investigative work.\n\n\"We are extremely worried about the safety of our colleague,\" said a spokesperson for the group. \"This detention is a blatant attack on press freedom and an attempt to silence a brave journalist who has dedicated their life to uncovering the truth.\"\n\nThe group has been working tirelessly to gather information about the journalist's situation and has contacted Turkish authorities, requesting access to the detainee and clarification regarding the charges, if any, leveled against them. So far, they have received no official response.\n\nThe detention has sparked outrage among other journalists and human rights activists, who have launched a social media campaign demanding the journalist's immediate release. The hashtag #FreeSyrianJournalist is trending globally, with thousands of people expressing their solidarity and condemning the Turkish government's actions.\n\nConcerns are mounting that the journalist may be at risk of ill-treatment or even deportation back to Syria, where they could face severe repercussions for their reporting. The advocacy group is urging international organizations and governments to intervene and pressure Turkey to release the journalist and ensure their safety.\n\n\"The Turkish government has a responsibility to protect journalists and uphold freedom of the press,\" the spokesperson added. \"This detention sends a chilling message to all journalists, both Syrian and Turkish, who are working to report on sensitive issues.\"\n\nThe incident comes amid growing concerns about the deteriorating state of press freedom in Turkey, where dozens of journalists have been imprisoned or subjected to legal harassment in recent years. Critics accuse the government of using anti-terrorism laws to silence dissenting voices and stifle critical reporting.\n"

    "HWT": "Previous displays in Boston, Lincolnshire, have featured clusters of lights and miniature trees along its cobbled shopping streets. But this year's simpler offering has been compared unfavourably to a living room Christmas tree by some. Councillor Paul Skinner said the authority could no longer justify the Â£40,000 annual cost. More on this and other local stories from across Lincolnshire He said Boston Borough Council's Christmas lights contract came to an end this year, and it voted not to renew it. In previous years, as pictured below, trees were lit up along the length of Church Street, with clusters of lights used to illuminate the sections across the street. Posting on Facebook, one resident described the authority as \"a bunch of miserable scrooges\". While one caller to BBC Radio Lincolnshire said her four-year-old daughter \"absolutely cried her eyes out because there was nothing to look at\". She said her own personal Christmas tree had as many lights as the town centre display. On social media, Frank Slater described the council as \"a bunch of miserable scrooges\" while Gina Tilling described the lights as \"dismal\". Others said it looked as though Christmas had been cancelled, and Boston was \"dark and joyless\". Barry Brackenbury joked that the council was doing its bit to \"slow global warming\".

The local council is facing a wave of criticism, with many branding them \"Scrooges\" for their perceived lack of effort in decorating the town for the holiday season.\n\nMain Street, typically a vibrant spectacle of twinkling lights and festive displays, is now sparsely adorned with a few strands of faded bulbs and a noticeably smaller Christmas tree compared to previous years. Residents have taken to social media to voice their frustration, sharing photos of the underwhelming decorations and lamenting the lack of festive cheer.\n\n\"It's just depressing,\" said local shop owner, Sarah Miller. \"Christmas is a crucial time for businesses, and the lack of atmosphere is really hurting morale. It doesn't feel like Christmas at all.\"\n\nMany residents are questioning where the funds allocated for Christmas decorations have gone. The council has yet to issue a statement addressing the concerns, further fueling the public's discontent. Rumors are circulating that budget cuts are to blame, but without official confirmation, speculation continues to rise.\n\nLocal community groups have offered to step in and provide additional decorations, but their offers have reportedly been met with bureaucratic hurdles and delays from the council. Some residents are even planning a protest outside the town hall to demand a more festive display.\n\nThe situation has cast a shadow over what should be a joyous time of year for Willow Creek. The lack of Christmas spirit is not only affecting residents' morale but also potentially impacting local businesses, who rely on the festive season for increased sales.

    "HWT": "The actor suffered a heart attack and was found at his home in California on Sunday. Pugsley was the oldest child of Gomez and Morticia Addams in the 1960s TV series. The show featured a family of macabre oddballs who believed they were normal, and was famed for its catchy finger-snapping theme song. The dysfunctional family were first created by cartoonist Charles Addams in the New Yorker magazine. The characters were made into a TV show, which aired on ABC from 1964 to 1966, had a total of 64 episodes. Weatherwax, who also voiced the role of Pugsley in an animated version of the series in the 1970s, played Pugsley senior in a TV special Halloween With the New Addams Family in 1977.. Three films based on the show were made during the 1990s. The first two starred Anjelica Huston, the late Raul Julia and Christopher Lloyd, while the third, released for TV in 1998, featured Darryl Hannah and Tim Curry. Following his role in The Addams Family, Weatherwax featured in several TV commercials and served in the army. He also worked for Universal Studios as a grip - providing support to camera operatives - according to his niece Shanyn Viera. In a 2007 interview on Fox News, Weatherwax said he enjoyed taking on the role of Pugsley but found it hard to find work because of typecasting. Weatherwax also said he had been teased at school about his character's name. He retired a few years ago for medical reasons, Ms Vieira added.",

Weatherwax passed away at his home in California on Sunday, reportedly from a heart attack.\n\nWeatherwax became a household name in the 1960s for his portrayal of the lovable, if somewhat morbid, son of Gomez and Morticia Addams. His Pugsley was known for his striped t-shirt, mischievous grin, and penchant for participating in his sister Wednesday's bizarre and often dangerous experiments.\n\nThe \"Addams Family\" aired on ABC for two seasons, from 1964 to 1966, but has remained a cultural touchstone through syndication, films, and animated series.

He worked as a grip and set builder on various film and television productions. He also made occasional appearances at \"Addams Family\" conventions and events, where he was always greeted warmly by fans.\n\nBorn in Los Angeles, Weatherwax came from a show business family. His aunt, Ruby Dandridge, was a well-known actress, and his half-brother, Joey D. Vieira, was also a child actor, known for his role as Porky in the \"Our Gang\" comedies.\n\nNews of Weatherwax's death has prompted an outpouring of tributes from fans and colleagues.

    "HWT": "Halfpenny has been at Toulon since 2014 but is out of contract in the summer. And while the 27-year-old may opt to return home to Wales, Dominguez is adamant he should stay in France if he is to keep developing his game. \"We speak very often with him about [his future], and I am confident he will stay,\" Dominguez said. \"I think for him it will be the best decision to be outside [Wales], to challenge the best every week. \"I respect him as a person so I have told him this, not as a coach, but as personal advice.\" Halfpenny joined Toulon from Cardiff Blues from the 2014-15 campaign and was a Heineken Cup winner at the end of his first season with the club. Under the terms of the Welsh Rugby Union's senior player selection policy, Halfpenny will have to rely on a wildcard pick if he is to play for the national side. Interim head coach Rob Howley hopes the ruling will encourage those based overseas to return to a region. It is understood Halfpenny remains open-minded about his future, and is concentrating on reaching peak form and fitness after missing the bulk of last season with a serious knee injury. However Dominguez, the former Italy fly-half, believes the player will soon be back to his best. \"It is never simple to come back but Leigh is coming back very well. He is very professional. I have no doubt he will come back 100% as he was before the injury,\" Dominguez told BBC Radio 5 live. \"He is happy at the club, he is having a good time. This year he is much more open, he is making new friends in France, speaking French. \"He hasn't made the decision yet, but I will be very happy if he stays and the club will be very happy if he stays.\" Halfpenny confirmed in September he will be available for the British and Irish Lions tour of New Zealand next summer. He said Toulon will allow him to miss the Top 14 finals to join up with the Lions should he be selected.",
    "MGT": "Toulon head coach Diego Dominguez has expressed his confidence that Welsh international Leigh Halfpenny will remain with the club for the upcoming season. The full-back, who has been a key figure for both Wales and the British & Irish Lions, has been the subject of speculation regarding his future, with rumors circulating about a potential return to Wales.\n\nHowever, Dominguez appears to be putting those rumors to rest, stating that he expects Halfpenny to honor his contract and continue to contribute to the Toulon squad. Speaking after a recent training session, Dominguez emphasized the importance of Halfpenny to the team, highlighting his professionalism and dedication.\n\n\"Leigh is a vital part of our plans,\" Dominguez said. \"He is a world-class player and a fantastic professional. We are very happy to have him here at Toulon, and I am confident that he will be with us next season.\"\n\nHalfpenny joined Toulon in 2014 and has since established himself as a firm favorite with the fans. His accurate goal-kicking and solid defensive play have been instrumental in Toulon's success during his tenure. He has also proven to be a valuable asset in open play, contributing with his intelligent running and ability to create opportunities for his teammates.\n\nThe news will be welcomed by Toulon supporters, who are eager to see Halfpenny continue to wear the red and black jersey. His presence in the squad provides a sense of stability and experience, which is particularly valuable as the team looks to compete for top honors in the Top 14 and the European Rugby Champions Cup.\n\nWhile Dominguez's comments suggest that Halfpenny is committed to staying at Toulon, the player himself has remained relatively quiet on the matter. This has fueled some of the speculation surrounding his future, with some suggesting that he may be tempted by a lucrative offer from a Welsh region.\n\nHowever, it appears that Dominguez has managed to convince Halfpenny that his future lies in France, at least for the time being. The Toulon coach has a reputation for building strong relationships with his players, and it is likely that he has played a key role in persuading Halfpenny to stay.\n\nThe retention of Halfpenny would be a significant boost for Toulon, as they look to build on their recent performances. The club has invested heavily in its squad in recent years, and Halfpenny is seen as a crucial part of their long-term plans.\n"

The debris is thought to have broken away shortly before hitting Miss Martin, from Stafford. Environmental health officers are investigating, the hearing was told. Read more news for Birmingham and the Black Country Solihull-born Miss Martin, who worked at the University of Wolverhampton, was struck by the cover while walking near a Starbucks cafe in Dudley Street last Thursday. It is believed the cover was attached to a structure on the roof of the nearby Mander Centre shopping mall. Det Sgt John Garbett, of West Midlands Police, told the Black Country Coroner's Court officers had recovered CCTV footage showing the moment the object fell from a roof and hit Miss Martin. A joint inquiry with the Health and Safety Executive and Wolverhampton City Council established the cover was thought to have been attached to one of two brick structures on the uppermost roof of the shopping mall, Mr Garbett said. Environmental health officers are investigating the cover's maintenance schedule, which caused Miss Martin's fatal head injuries, the inquest heard. A small part of the cover that struck Miss Martin broke off before she was hit, the inquest heard, while a second cover is believed to have been blown on to a lower roof. Mr Garbett confirmed formal contact had not yet been made with the owner of the building.

Anne Smeding, 60, was walking near the University of Reading campus on February 23, 2017, when she was hit by a section of the tank cover that had been ripped off by strong winds. She sustained fatal head injuries and was pronounced dead at the scene.\n\nThe inquest, held at Reading Town Hall, focused on the condition of the water tank cover and the maintenance procedures in place at the university. Evidence presented suggested that the wooden structure, which covered a large water tank on top of a building, had not been adequately maintained in the years leading up to the incident.\n\nA structural engineer who examined the remaining parts of the tank cover testified that there were visible signs of rot and decay in the wood. He stated that the deterioration likely weakened the structure, making it more susceptible to damage from strong winds. The engineer added that a more robust inspection and maintenance schedule could have identified and addressed these issues before the storm.\n\nUniversity representatives acknowledged that while regular inspections were conducted, they may not have been sufficient to detect the extent of the decay. They stated that the university has since implemented more rigorous inspection protocols and has invested in the replacement of similar structures across the campus.\n\nThe jury heard that Storm Doris brought unusually strong winds to the Reading area, with gusts reaching speeds of up to 70 miles per hour. However, the coroner emphasized that the inquest was not intended to determine whether the storm was solely responsible for the incident, but rather to examine the circumstances surrounding Smeding's death and identify any potential failures that may have contributed to it. The inquest is expected to conclude later this week.\n"

    "HWT": "Paul Cummins received threats by email, phone and letter over plans for services charities to benefit from the Â£10m raised, he told the Sunday Times. The Derbyshire artist said he believed it was because some people felt the charities were \"involved in war\". Blood Swept Lands And Seas Of Red saw 888,246 ceramic poppies \"planted\" in the moat. Each poppy represented one British or colonial military death during World War One. The installation culminated on Armistice Day when the final poppy was planted by 13-year old cadet Harry Hayes from Berkshire, before the guns were fired 21 times and a two-minute silence was observed. Mr Cummins said: \"The threats came, I suppose, because they felt that the money was going to charities which in some way were involved in war.\" He added that police had been called in over the matter. It is thought about five million people visited Blood-Swept Lands and Seas of Red, the title of which was inspired by a line from the will of a Derbyshire serviceman who died in Flanders. He had described \"the blood-swept lands and seas of red, where angels fear to tread\". The following day a team of 8,000 volunteers started removing the 888,246 poppies and sending them to the people who bought them for Â£25 each. The net proceeds plus 10% of every sale generated the Â£10m being shared between Help for Heroes, the Royal British Legion, Combat Stress, Cobseo, Coming Home and SSAFA.

While the vast majority of the public responded with overwhelming support and appreciation, a small minority expressed their disapproval in the form of hateful messages and even direct threats against his life.\n\nThe artist declined to elaborate on the specific nature of the threats or their origins, citing ongoing concerns for his safety and that of his family. However, he acknowledged the profound impact they had on him, particularly during what should have been a period of immense pride and satisfaction.\n\nThe poppy installation became a national phenomenon, drawing millions of visitors from across the country and around the world. Images of the sea of red surrounding the Tower of London were widely circulated, becoming a powerful symbol of remembrance and loss.\n\nDespite the negative experiences, Cummins has remained committed to creating impactful and thought-provoking art. He has since undertaken several other large-scale projects, continuing to explore themes of history, memory, and human connection. He stated that while the death threats were deeply unsettling, they have not deterred him from pursuing his artistic vision. He maintains that the positive response to the poppy installation far outweighed the negativity, reinforcing his belief in the power of art to unite and heal.

    "HWT": "The men were watching a World Cup game in June 1994 when gunmen burst into the Heights Bar in Loughinisland, County Down, and opened fire. Five others were wounded in the attack carried out by the loyalist paramilitary Ulster Volunteer Force. No-one has ever been convicted of the attack. Families of the victims have persistently accused the police of failing to properly investigate the killings, claiming they wanted to protect informers. They have alleged there was collusion between some police officers and those who carried out the attack. The men who died were Adrian Rogan 34, Malcolm Jenkinson, 53, Barney Greene, 87, Daniel McCreanor 59, Patrick O'Hare, 35, and Eamon Byrne, 39. Mr Greene was one of the oldest people to be killed in the Northern Ireland Troubles. Five years ago the previous police ombudsman, Al Hutchinson, published a report which said the police had not properly investigated the killings. But his report said there was insufficient evidence of collusion between the police and the Ulster Volunteer Force. The families took legal action and in December 2012 the report's findings were quashed. Mr Hutchinson resigned shortly afterwards and his successor, Dr Michael Maguire, re-opened the investigation. The families and their lawyers were briefed about the findings in Loughinisland on Wednesday. Dr Maguire's report will contain thousands of words, but for the families of those killed and seriously injured in the Heights Bar, the focus will be on whether he uses just one word - collusion. South Down MP, the SDLP's Margaret Ritchie, told BBC Radio Ulster's Good Morning Ulster programme: \"We want to see Dr Maguire call it for what it is. It is collusion. \"\"But we also want him to say quite clearly, who did it, how many were involved in it, was there local involvement in this heinous crime?\"",
    "MGT": "The Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland is expected to release a long-awaited report addressing allegations of collusion between police and the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) in connection with a series of murders that occurred over two decades ago. The investigation centers on the deaths of six Catholic men who were killed in a series of attacks attributed to the loyalist paramilitary group in 2001 and 2002.\n\nThe report, which has been years in the making, is anticipated to examine claims that police officers actively aided and abetted the UVF, as well as allegations of investigative failures and a deliberate attempt to protect informants within the organization. Families of the victims have long campaigned for a thorough and independent inquiry into the circumstances surrounding the deaths of their loved ones, alleging that the police were aware of the UVF’s activities but failed to take adequate steps to prevent the attacks.\n\nThe families are hopeful that the Ombudsman's report will finally shed light on the truth and provide them with a sense of closure after years of uncertainty and grief. They have consistently argued that collusion between the police and the UVF allowed the paramilitary group to operate with impunity, leading to the deaths of innocent civilians.\n\nThe Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) has stated that it is fully cooperating with the Ombudsman's investigation. The PSNI has emphasized its commitment to accountability and transparency and pledged to carefully consider the findings of the report.\n\nThe Ombudsman's office has declined to comment on the specifics of the report's findings, citing the need to maintain impartiality and avoid prejudicing any potential future legal proceedings. However, sources close to the investigation have indicated that the report will be highly critical of certain aspects of the police’s handling of the case.\n\nThe release of the report is expected to be met with mixed reactions. While families of the victims will likely welcome any findings that support their claims of collusion, others may dispute the report's conclusions and defend the actions of the police. The report is expected to reignite debate about the legacy of the Troubles and the role of state forces in the conflict. It remains to be seen what impact the report will have on relations between the police and the Catholic community.\n"

The court also heard Ms Pinches \"flung\" another child after picking them up by the wrist for not listening. The defence claim the child threw themselves on the floor in a tantrum. Ms Khadiri said this behaviour happened \"every time\" during her placement, but she did not make a complaint to the nursery or her lecturers because she felt \"scared\" to speak out. Bright Sparks opened in 2014 and catered for babies as well as children up to the age of eight. The alleged offences are said to have taken place over a four-month period starting in late 2015. Ms Davies, of Port Talbot, is accused of one count of causing cruelty to a person under the age of 16. Pinchess, of Cwmavon, faces six charges of the same offence and Forgan, of Port Talbot, is accused of three counts of the charge. The trial continues.",
    "MGT": "A nursery worker in Port Talbot is facing allegations of child mistreatment after a student on a work placement reported witnessing a disturbing incident. The alleged event took place at an unnamed nursery in the area, according to testimony presented in court.\n\nThe student, who was observing and assisting at the nursery as part of her educational program, claims she saw a member of the nursery staff grab a young child by the wrist and \"fling\" them a short distance. The student immediately reported the incident to her supervisors and subsequently to the relevant authorities.\n\nThe staff member in question has been suspended from their position pending the outcome of the investigation and subsequent legal proceedings. Details about the child's age and any potential injuries sustained have not been released to protect their privacy.\n\nThe local council, responsible for overseeing childcare facilities in the region, has confirmed that they are aware of the allegations and are cooperating fully with the police investigation. A spokesperson stated that the safety and well-being of children in their care is of paramount importance, and they are taking the matter extremely seriously.\n\nParents of children attending the nursery have expressed shock and concern upon learning of the allegations. Many are demanding answers and assurances that their children are safe and well cared for. The nursery has issued a statement acknowledging the ongoing investigation and assuring parents that they are committed to providing a safe and nurturing environment for all children in their care.\n\nThe court proceedings are expected to continue in the coming weeks, with further evidence and witness testimonies being presented. The outcome of the case will likely have significant implications for the nursery and the individuals involved.\n"

    "prompt": "There are 94,000 fewer smokers in Wales since a ban on lighting up in enclosed public places came into force 10 years ago, Welsh Government data shows.",
    "HWT": "Sunday marks a decade since the law came in and 19% of adults in Wales now smoke compared to 24% before the ban. There are also 6% fewer teenage boys and 14% fewer teenage girls smoking. Campaign charity Ash Wales said there had been a \"major cultural shift\" but smokers' group Forest said the ban had hit pubs and clubs. The only group that saw an increase in smokers was the unemployed, where the level has risen from 41% to 43% in the last 10 years. Ash Cymru said other measures had contributed to the fall in smoking, such as the ban on sales from vending machines, uniform packaging, and the rise in the age limit to buy tobacco from 16 to 18. Chief executive Suzanne Cass said: \"The smoking ban has resulted in the most positive improvement in the nation's health in decades. \"The significance of this legislation should not be underestimated. \"Thousands more children now live in a smoke-free home, and hundreds of thousands of people are no longer subjected to the deadly effects of passive smoking.\" Ms Cass also said she supported the increased use of e-cigarettes, with 141,000 users in Wales, saying they are \"95% less harmful than traditional cigarettes\". The charity's research showed 81% of people in Wales supported the ban - including three quarters of smokers themselves. However, in its own survey of 1,000 people, pro-smoking group Forest found 58% of people think pubs and private members' clubs should be allowed to provide well-ventilated smoking rooms, with 37% opposed. Forest director Simon Clark said: \"The suggestion that the smoking ban is hugely popular has been exposed as a myth. \"The smoking ban hit pubs and working men's clubs really badly.\" He called on the Welsh Government to commission an independent review on the full impact of the ban including public health, the hospitality industry and local communities. It will comment on the figures on Monday.",
    "MGT": "Ten years after Wales implemented a ban on smoking in enclosed public spaces, new government data reveals a significant decline in the number of smokers across the nation. Figures released this week indicate that there are approximately 94,000 fewer smokers in Wales compared to the period before the ban came into effect.\n\nThe Public Health (Wales) Act 2006, which introduced the ban in 2007, prohibited smoking in virtually all enclosed public spaces and workplaces, including pubs, restaurants, offices, and public transportation. The aim was to protect non-smokers from the harmful effects of secondhand smoke and to encourage smokers to quit.\n\nHealth officials are hailing the figures as a major success, attributing the decline in smoking rates not only to the ban itself, but also to its ripple effect on societal attitudes towards smoking. The legislation has fostered a culture where smoking is less normalized and more actively discouraged.\n\n\"These figures are incredibly encouraging and demonstrate the positive impact of the smoking ban on the health of the Welsh population,\" said a spokesperson for the Welsh Government’s health department. \"The ban has not only protected non-smokers from exposure to harmful smoke but has also played a crucial role in helping smokers to quit and preventing young people from starting.\"\n\nWhile the ban has been widely credited with improving public health, some initial concerns were raised by businesses, particularly in the hospitality sector, who feared a decline in trade. However, studies have shown that these concerns were largely unfounded, and the majority of businesses have adapted successfully to the new regulations.\n\nThe decline in smoking rates in Wales mirrors a similar trend observed across the UK and other countries that have implemented similar bans. Public health experts believe that comprehensive tobacco control strategies, including smoking bans, taxation, and public awareness campaigns, are essential to further reduce smoking prevalence and its associated health risks.\n\nDespite the progress made, health officials acknowledge that more work needs to be done to tackle smoking in Wales. They are committed to continuing to support smokers who want to quit and to prevent young people from taking up the habit in the first place. Plans are underway to explore further measures to reduce smoking rates, including initiatives targeting specific demographics and communities where smoking prevalence remains high.\n"

    "HWT": "Kevin Wood, his partner Kirsty Henderson and her sister Megan found a £500 gold bar in Folkestone after digging for an hour at low tide. German artist Michael Sailstorfer buried £10,000 worth of bullion as part of Folkestone Triennial arts festival. The trio travelled from their home in Canterbury to join the gold rush on Friday. Describing the moment he struck the precious metal, Mr Wood, 28, said: \"My legs went from under me and I started shaking. \"I put it quietly in my pocket. We left the beach and half-way home, we pulled over for a drink.\" The Folkestone Digs project is part of the town's arts festival which has included work by artists including Tracey Emin, Jeremy Deller and Martin Creed in previous years. Artists including Yoko Ono are taking part in this year's festival which runs until November 2. Mr Wood said the couple first thought they might sell the gold straight away and go on holiday to Paris. \"Now we're thinking we might keep hold of it because of all the interest,\" he said. \"We are not going to rush into anything.\" Curator Lewis Biggs said the beach had been full since it was announced on Thursday the gold had been buried. \"There are always people digging on the beach but there's a lot more digging on the beach now,\" he said. \"When it's at high tide there are maybe 50 people, when it's low tide maybe 1,000. \"There are a lot of people coming and going of all ages - families, dedicated people with metal detectors, people with lights on their heads all night. \"It's been fun down there.\" It is not known how many other people may have found the gold bars. \"What you find is yours and you can tell other people or not,\" said Mr Biggs. \"You can stick it in your sock and take it home so we will never know if they have all been found or not.\"",
    "MGT": "Deal, Kent - A trio of amateur treasure hunters have struck gold, quite literally, becoming the first confirmed individuals to unearth a significant cache of 24-carat gold artifacts buried on a Kent beach. The discovery, made near Deal, has sent ripples of excitement through the archaeological and metal detecting communities.\n\nThe group, who wish to remain largely anonymous to avoid unwanted attention, stumbled upon the hoard while scanning the shoreline with metal detectors during a low tide. Initial signals indicated the presence of metal, but the depth and intensity suggested something far more substantial than the usual discarded coins and bottle caps.\n\nAfter hours of careful excavation, sifting through sand and shingle, the first glint of gold emerged. Over the course of several days, the team painstakingly unearthed a collection of intricately crafted items, all remarkably preserved despite their prolonged burial. The find includes several complete necklaces, numerous pendants adorned with precious stones, and a selection of rings and bracelets, all fashioned from pure 24-carat gold.\n\nExperts are still analyzing the artifacts to determine their precise age and origin. Preliminary assessments suggest the treasure could date back to the Roman era, or possibly even earlier, potentially linking it to a wealthy individual or family seeking to protect their valuables from invaders or raiders. The quality of the craftsmanship points to a highly skilled artisan, suggesting a society with a sophisticated understanding of metallurgy and jewelry making.\n\nLocal historians are particularly intrigued by the location of the find. The Deal coastline has a rich and turbulent history, serving as a landing point for numerous invasions and a strategic naval location for centuries. The presence of such a valuable hoard raises questions about the region's past and the lives of those who once inhabited the area.\n\nThe treasure has been reported to the relevant authorities, including the Finds Liaison Officer for Kent, as required by UK law. The artifacts will now undergo further evaluation by experts at the British Museum, who will determine their significance and value. Under the Treasure Act 1996, the find will be offered to museums, and the treasure hunters will be eligible for a reward, which will be shared equally among them.\n\nThe discovery is being hailed as a major archaeological find, offering a rare glimpse into the past and providing valuable insights into the lives and culture of those who lived in Kent centuries ago. It serves as a reminder that even in the most familiar landscapes, hidden treasures and untold stories lie waiting to be unearthed.\n"

The Dark Blues are bracing themselves for potential bids for the dynamic duo during the January transfer window, with their impressive performances attracting attention from clubs in Scotland and beyond.\n\nHemmings, the club's top scorer, has been in scintillating form this season, netting crucial goals and providing a constant threat to opposing defenses. Stewart, known for his creativity and skillful play, has been equally vital, contributing with assists and goals from midfield.\n\nO'Dea, a seasoned professional with experience at Celtic and in the English Championship, acknowledges the significant impact Hemmings and Stewart have on the team. He believes their departure would leave a void that would be incredibly difficult to fill, especially within a short timeframe.\n\n\"Replacing players of their quality is virtually impossible in the short term,\" O'Dea stated. \"They bring so much to the team, not just in terms of goals and assists, but also in their overall contribution to the way we play.\"\n\nThe defender emphasized the understanding and chemistry the two players have developed on the pitch, making them a potent attacking force. He highlighted their ability to create opportunities and score goals from seemingly impossible situations, a quality that is rare and highly valued.\n\nWhile O'Dea recognizes the potential financial benefits of selling Hemmings and Stewart, he also stressed the importance of maintaining a competitive squad. He believes that losing both players would significantly weaken the team's chances of achieving their goals this season.\n\n\"Of course, football is a business, and decisions will be made based on what's best for the club,\" O'Dea said. \"But from a purely footballing perspective, losing Kane and Greg would be a massive blow.\"\n\nDundee manager Paul Hartley faces a challenging situation as he prepares for the January transfer window. He will be keen to keep hold of his key players, but he also has to be realistic about the possibility of receiving offers that are too good to refuse.\n\nThe club's supporters will be hoping that Hemmings and Stewart remain at Dens Park, as their presence significantly enhances the team's attacking prowess. However, they also understand the financial realities of football and the potential for players to move on to bigger clubs.

    "prompt": "A new method of delivering data, which uses the visible spectrum rather than radio waves, has been tested in a working office.",
    "HWT": "Li-fi can deliver internet access 100 times faster than traditional wi-fi, offering speeds of up to 1Gbps (gigabit per second). It requires a light source, such as a standard LED bulb, an internet connection and a photo detector. It was tested this week by Estonian start-up Velmenni, in Tallinn. Velmenni used a li-fi-enabled light bulb to transmit data at speeds of 1Gbps. Laboratory tests have shown theoretical speeds of up to 224Gbps. It was tested in an office, to allow workers to access the internet and in an industrial space, where it provided a smart lighting solution. Speaking to the International Business Times, chief executive Deepak Solanki said that the technology could reach consumers \"within three to four years\". The term li-fi was first coined by Prof Harald Haas from Edinburgh University, who demonstrated the technology at a Ted (Technology, Entertainment and Design) conference in 2011. His talk, which has now been watched nearly two million times, showed an LED lamp streaming video. Prof Haas described a future when billions of light bulbs could become wireless hotspots. One of the big advantages of li-fi is the fact that, unlike wi-fi,  it does not interfere with other radio signals, so could be utilised on aircraft and in other places where interference is an issue. While the spectrum for radio waves is in short supply, the visible light spectrum is 10,000 times larger, meaning it is unlikely to run out any time soon. But the technology also has its drawbacks - most notably the fact that it cannot be deployed outdoors in direct sunlight, because that would interfere with its signal. Neither can the technology travel through walls so initial use is likely to be limited to places where it can be used to supplement wi-fi networks, such as in congested urban areas or places where wi-fi is not safe, such as hospitals.",
    "MGT": "A groundbreaking trial of a revolutionary data transmission technology has been successfully conducted in a typical office environment. This new method harnesses the power of visible light, offering a potential alternative to traditional radio wave-based wireless communication.\n\nThe technology, known as Li-Fi, transmits data by modulating the intensity of light emitted by LED bulbs. These rapid fluctuations in brightness, imperceptible to the human eye, are then detected by a receiver, which decodes the information. The recent trial marks a significant step forward in the real-world application of Li-Fi, moving it beyond laboratory settings and into a practical, everyday context.\n\nResearchers involved in the project report promising results, demonstrating the viability of Li-Fi for various applications within an office space. The system proved capable of supporting standard tasks such as web browsing, video streaming, and file sharing. Furthermore, the technology boasts enhanced security features, as light waves are inherently confined to a specific area, preventing data from leaking beyond the room.\n\nOne of the key advantages of Li-Fi is its potential to alleviate the strain on congested radio wave frequencies. As the demand for wireless data continues to surge, the radio spectrum is becoming increasingly crowded, leading to slower speeds and unreliable connections. Li-Fi offers a solution by utilizing a completely different part of the electromagnetic spectrum, freeing up valuable radio frequencies for other uses.\n\nThe implications of this technology extend beyond the office environment. Li-Fi could revolutionize data transmission in a variety of settings, including hospitals, airplanes, and even underwater environments where radio waves struggle to penetrate. Its inherent security features also make it an attractive option for sensitive data transmission in government and military facilities.\n\nWhile still in its early stages of development, Li-Fi holds immense promise as a future technology. Ongoing research and development efforts are focused on improving its range, speed, and reliability. As the technology matures, it has the potential to transform the way we connect and communicate, ushering in a new era of light-speed data transmission.\n"

    "prompt": "The latest weather data suggest that the Earth's average temperature is close to breaking the record set in 2010.",
    "HWT": "Even more striking is the fact that if this occurs, then fourteen out of fifteen of the warmest years on record will have occurred since the turn of the century. However, while record-breaking warmth is consistent with the general trend of global warming, it's not always the case that each year is warmer than the previous one. There are temporary ups and downs that ride on top of the overall warming trend. It's quite possible for a few years to elapse before the next record year, and the warming can speed up or slow down for runs of years, as happened for example in the slowdown of warming since the end of the last century. So what makes one year warmer or colder than its predecessor? The answer to this depends on a number of factors. Large volcanic eruptions can cause a temporary dip in temperatures for a few years due to reflection of sunlight by the resulting atmospheric particles. This happened following the eruption of Mt Pinatubo in 1991, for example. Fluctuations in the ocean can also cause temporary ups and downs, and the massive heat release during an El Nino event in the tropics can temporarily raise global temperatures, such as occurred in 1998. This year, the tropical ocean has indeed warmed up in both the Pacific and the Atlantic but both of these ocean basins have also been very warm in northern latitudes, compounding the effect on global temperature. While the oceans exhibit record warmth, it is the average temperature over land regions and in the Arctic that has risen most. It is worth noting that this is consistent with predictions from computer models of climate change, which have suggested for many years that warming over land, and over the Arctic, will outstrip the increase in global average temperature as climate change progresses. The WMO report highlights a number of record-breaking weather events around the world:",
    "MGT": "Global temperatures are teetering on the brink of surpassing the record high set in 2010, according to newly released weather data. Scientists are expressing concern as the information paints a picture of a planet continuing to warm at an alarming rate. Multiple factors contribute to this potentially record-breaking year, including ongoing greenhouse gas emissions and naturally occurring climate patterns.\n\nThe data, compiled from various international meteorological agencies, indicates that the average global temperature for the year is within a small margin of exceeding the 2010 benchmark. If current trends continue, experts predict that the record will likely be broken before the year's end. This milestone would mark yet another stark reminder of the escalating climate crisis and its far-reaching consequences.\n\nRising temperatures are already contributing to a cascade of environmental problems worldwide. Increased frequency and intensity of heatwaves, prolonged droughts, and more powerful storms are becoming increasingly common. Melting glaciers and polar ice sheets are contributing to rising sea levels, threatening coastal communities and ecosystems. Shifts in precipitation patterns are disrupting agriculture and water resources, leading to food insecurity in many regions.\n\nThe primary driver of this warming trend is the continued release of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, largely from the burning of fossil fuels for energy production, transportation, and industrial processes. These gases trap heat, causing a gradual increase in global temperatures. While international agreements like the Paris Agreement aim to limit global warming, current emission reduction pledges are insufficient to meet the targets needed to prevent the most catastrophic impacts of climate change.\n\nBeyond the immediate environmental consequences, rising temperatures also pose significant threats to human health and well-being. Heat-related illnesses are on the rise, particularly among vulnerable populations such as the elderly and those with pre-existing conditions. Changes in climate are also expanding the ranges of disease-carrying vectors, increasing the risk of infectious diseases.\n\nScientists emphasize the urgent need for accelerated action to mitigate climate change. This includes transitioning to cleaner energy sources, improving energy efficiency, and implementing sustainable land management practices. They also stress the importance of adaptation measures to help communities cope with the impacts of climate change that are already being felt. While the challenges are significant, experts remain hopeful that collective action can avert the worst-case scenarios and build a more sustainable future.\n"

    "HWT": "Top seed Williams won the first set 6-4 and was a tie-break away from defeating the 26th seed when they came off. After a two-and-a-half hour delay, Williams converted a fifth match point to win 6-4 7-6 (12-10) in Paris. The American, 34, aiming for her 22nd Grand Slam title, was joined in the next round by older sister Venus. Venus's match against France's Alize Cornet was stopped at 2-1 because of the rain but the 35-year-old came back to seal a hard-fought 7-6 1-6 6-0 win. Serena had dropped just five games in her first two matches at Roland Garros, but faced a tougher test against the French number one. Each player held their serve in the opening set until Williams edged ahead in the 10th game by taking her third break point. Neither could gain an advantage in the second set, with Mladenovic thumping down an ace in the rain to set up a tie-breaker. When the match finally resumed on Court Philippe Chatrier, Mladenovic led 5-3 in the decider - and spurned a set point at 9-8 - before two wayward forehands saw Williams through. \"It was very difficult, she played really, really well,\" Serena said. \"She forced me to bring out my best tennis.\" She will play in the fourth round against Ukraine's 18th seed Elina Svitolina, who won 6-4 6-4 against 2008 champion Ana Ivanovic.

The Frenchwoman’s aggressive play and deft touch at the net kept the American on her toes throughout the match. Williams, however, relied on her powerful serve and relentless groundstrokes to maintain control.\n\nThe match was suspended due to heavy rain with Williams leading by a set and a break. The delay lasted for several hours, forcing both players to retreat to the locker room and regroup. Upon resumption, Mladenovic came out firing, breaking Williams' serve and leveling the second set.\n\nHowever, Williams quickly regained her composure and broke back immediately. The American showcased her championship pedigree, raising her level in the crucial moments and dictating the rallies with greater authority.\n\nDespite Mladenovic's spirited efforts, Williams' experience and sheer power proved too much to handle. The world number one closed out the match, demonstrating why she remains the woman to beat at Roland Garros. While the victory was hard-fought, Williams displayed the resilience and determination that have defined her illustrious career. She now advances to the next round, where she will face another tough opponent as she continues her quest for another Grand Slam title.

The British number five was facing off against Yulia Putintseva of Kazakhstan when the setback occurred, leaving Watson visibly distressed and unable to continue.\n\nThe match, held in Toronto, Canada, saw Watson struggle from the outset. While the exact moment the injury occurred remains unclear, spectators noted that Watson seemed to be favoring her shoulder early in the first set. Her serve, usually a reliable weapon, appeared noticeably weakened, and she was seen wincing between points.\n\nDespite her evident discomfort, Watson battled on, determined to compete. However, after falling behind in the first set, she made the difficult decision to call for the trainer. Following a brief consultation and on-court treatment, it became clear that the injury was too severe to allow her to continue playing without risking further damage.\n\nWith a heavy heart, Watson made the decision to retire, shaking hands with Putintseva and the umpire before leaving the court. The crowd, though disappointed by the premature end to the match, offered Watson a warm round of applause, acknowledging her valiant effort and wishing her a speedy recovery.\n\nThe retirement marks a frustrating setback for Watson, who had been hoping to gain momentum heading into the latter part of the season. The extent of the shoulder injury is currently unknown, and Watson will undergo further medical evaluation to determine the severity and the appropriate course of treatment.\n\nThis latest setback adds to a challenging year for the British player, who has struggled to find consistent form on the WTA tour. Shoulder injuries can be particularly debilitating for tennis players, as they directly impact serving and overhead shots, crucial elements of the game.\n\nPutintseva advances to the next round, where she will face a yet-to-be-determined opponent. For Watson, the focus now shifts to recovery and rehabilitation. Her fans will be hoping that she can make a swift and full recovery and return to the court soon.

    "HWT": "The Celtic midfielder spent the second half of last season on loan at the Dons, scoring seven goals in 15 games. But he admits to being unsure about a return until manager McInnes turned down the chance to join English Championship club Sunderland. \"As soon as I heard that, my mind was made up to come back,\" Christie said. The 22-year-old was invited back to Aberdeen as part of the deal that took Jonny Hayes to Celtic for £1.3m. Sunderland's move for McInnes, to replace David Moyes, caused Christie a few moments of concern as he enjoyed his summer holiday. McInnes decided against a switch to Wearside to stay with the club he guided to second place in the Scottish Premiership and runners-up in both domestic cup competitions last term. That delighted Christie on a personal level and he also believes it was a significant moment for the whole of Scottish football. \"It came out in the press that I would be coming back, but I was still on holiday lying on a beach,\" Christie told Red TV. \"I hadn't had a phone call, so I didn't know what was going on. \"When I came back, things had got into motion, but understandably I didn't want to make a decision until I knew the gaffer was staying. \"When the news broke that he was going to stay, it was a shock to a lot of people in Scottish football, but it's brilliant news. \"Not just for the club, as it is a huge lift, but also for the whole of Scottish football. \"For a few years there it turned out to be that as soon as there was any offer from England, people would jump ship.

However, the opportunity to continue his development under McInnes' guidance proved too tempting to resist. He believes that McInnes' tactical acumen and man-management skills have been instrumental in his growth as a player.\n\n\"The manager staying was massive,\" Christie stated. \"I really enjoyed working under him last season, and I feel like he got the best out of me. Knowing that he was going to be here made the decision a lot easier.\"\n\nChristie highlighted the stability and ambition that McInnes brings to Aberdeen. He believes that the manager's long-term vision for the club aligns with his own aspirations, making Pittodrie the ideal environment for him to progress.\n\n\"Aberdeen is a club with a clear direction, and that's largely down to the manager,\" Christie explained. \"He's built a strong squad and created a winning mentality. I want to be a part of that.\"\n\nThe midfielder is eager to pick up where he left off last season, contributing to Aberdeen's push for silverware and European qualification. He acknowledges the challenges that lie ahead but is confident that the team has the quality and determination to achieve its goals.\n\n\"We had a good season last year, but we want to improve on that,\" Christie said. \"We want to compete for trophies and make a real impact in Europe. I believe we have the squad to do that.\"\n\nChristie's return to Aberdeen has been welcomed by fans and teammates alike. His creativity and goal-scoring ability will undoubtedly bolster the Dons' attacking options. His presence in midfield is expected to provide a significant boost as they embark on their upcoming campaign.\n\nThe loan deal is expected to last for the entirety of the season, giving Christie ample time to make his mark on the team.

    "HWT": "The Halifax said that prices rose at an annual pace of 7.9% last month - down from 9.6% in June. During July itself, prices actually fell, by 0.6%, the largest monthly drop since April 2014. It brings the average price of a flat or house across the country back down to Â£198,883. The sharp fall in July was described as \"a correction\" by Howard Archer, chief UK economist with IHS Global Insight, following a 1.6% rise in prices in June. The Halifax figures are in contrast to those from rival lender Nationwide, which said earlier this week that the rate of house price growth picked up to 3.5% in July, from 3.3% a month earlier. However, the Halifax said it expected strong growth in prices for the rest of the year. \"The underlying pace of house price growth remains robust notwithstanding the easing in July,\" said Stephen Noakes, Halifax's managing director of retail customer products. \"Continuing economic recovery, earnings growth in excess of consumer price inflation, and very low mortgage rates all underpin housing demand.\" Mr Archer said the contrasting figures from the Halifax and Nationwide served as a warning against reading too much into any one survey. \"This highlights the need to not pin too much weight on one particular house price survey or measure, but to try and take an overall view from the data,\" he said. Nationwide and Halifax both base their data on mortgage approvals, but they use a different \"mix-adjustment\" in their methodology. That involves a different weighting of the figures, to reflect different types of property being sold in any month, and more sales in a particular region of the UK.",
    "MGT": "UK house price growth has cooled slightly in the year to July, according to Halifax, the nation's largest mortgage lender. While the market continues to see upward movement, the pace of increase has decelerated compared to previous months.\n\nThe latest data indicates a moderation in the rate of house price inflation, suggesting a potential shift in the dynamics of the property market. This development comes amid concerns about the broader economic outlook, including rising inflation and interest rates.\n\nDespite the slowdown, Halifax emphasized that house prices are still rising at a \"robust\" rate. This suggests that demand for housing remains strong, supported by factors such as a shortage of available properties and a desire for more space among buyers.\n\nHowever, the lender cautioned that the outlook for the housing market remains uncertain. The combination of inflationary pressures and rising borrowing costs could dampen buyer sentiment and lead to a further moderation in price growth.\n\nOther factors that could influence the housing market include government policies, such as changes to stamp duty or mortgage schemes, as well as broader economic trends, such as employment levels and consumer confidence.\n\nAnalysts noted that the slowdown in house price growth could be a welcome development for first-time buyers, who have struggled to get onto the property ladder in recent years. A more stable housing market could improve affordability and make it easier for people to purchase their first home.\n\nHowever, existing homeowners may be less enthusiastic about the prospect of slower price growth, as it could limit their ability to build equity and move up the property ladder.\n\nOverall, the UK housing market remains in a state of flux, with a range of factors influencing its trajectory. While the pace of house price growth has slowed, the market continues to exhibit resilience, supported by underlying demand and a shortage of supply.\n\nLooking ahead, the housing market's performance will likely depend on the interplay of economic forces, government policies, and buyer sentiment. A period of greater stability could be beneficial for both buyers and sellers, allowing for a more sustainable and balanced market.\n"

Becker, 59, denied any involvement. Two-and-a-half years already served in jail will be cut from her sentence. The killer has not yet been uncovered. The ambush happened in the south-western city of Karlsruhe. At the time the RAF was waging a violent campaign against the West German state, targeting prominent establishment figures and US military bases. Mr Buback and his two aides were shot dead by a passenger on a motorcycle as their car was waiting at traffic lights. Becker went on trial in Stuttgart in 2010, accused of playing a crucial role in planning and carrying out the murder. She was arrested the month after the murders.

The verdict marks the culmination of a long legal battle to bring members of the defunct terrorist group to justice for their violent acts.\n\nHogefeld, already serving a life sentence for other RAF-related crimes, was found guilty of participating in the planning and execution of the assassination. Buback, along with his driver and bodyguard, was killed in a hail of gunfire while driving through Karlsruhe.\n\nThe RAF, a radical leftist group active in West Germany during the 1970s and 1980s, claimed responsibility for a string of bombings, kidnappings, and assassinations targeting prominent figures in politics and business.

    "HWT": "But state officials said they would continue to investigate allegations of disrupting communal harmony. More than 60 students were suspended at the weekend after the Asia Cup match in which Pakistan defeated India. The students said they only clapped when Pakistan won. The district magistrate of Meerut city, Pankaj Yadav, confirmed to BBC Hindi that after investigating the complaint they found no evidence to support the sedition charge. But he said officials would continue to investigate allegations of other offences, including disrupting communal harmony and causing damage to public property. The sedition charge carries a three-year prison term in India. Earlier, Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Omar Abdullah promised to speak to the chief minister of Uttar Pradesh and intervene on the students' behalf, describing the charge as \"unacceptably harsh\" The incident happened at the Swami Vivekanand Subharti University in Meerut city on Sunday where a group of students  allegedly \"celebrated Pakistan's win\", leading to arguments with other college mates, reports say. The university administration then ordered an inquiry and decided to suspend the students as a \"precautionary measure\". Some of the Kashmiri students denied any wrongdoing in their statements to the media. Cricket matches between India and Pakistan are tense, dramatic affairs and are passionately followed in both countries. Claimed by both countries in its entirety, Kashmir has been a flashpoint for more than 60 years. The South Asian rivals have also fought two wars and a limited conflict.",
    "MGT": "The Uttar Pradesh government has withdrawn sedition charges against a group of Kashmiri students who were accused of celebrating Pakistan's victory in a cricket match. The charges, initially filed after a complaint alleged the students chanted pro-Pakistan slogans following the match, have been the subject of considerable debate and legal scrutiny.\n\nThe incident occurred last year after a cricket match between India and Pakistan. Following Pakistan's win, some individuals claimed that the Kashmiri students were heard raising slogans in support of the Pakistani team. This led to immediate outrage and accusations of sedition, resulting in their arrest.\n\nThe decision to drop the charges comes after a review of the evidence and legal considerations. Authorities concluded that the evidence was insufficient to sustain the serious charges of sedition. The move is seen by many as an effort to de-escalate tensions and promote reconciliation, particularly in the sensitive context of the Kashmir region.\n\nLawyers representing the students welcomed the decision, emphasizing that the charges were excessive and unwarranted. They argued that the students were unfairly targeted and subjected to undue harassment. Activists and human rights organizations have also applauded the withdrawal of the charges, highlighting the importance of protecting freedom of expression and preventing the misuse of sedition laws.\n\nThe case had raised concerns about the application of sedition laws in India, with critics arguing that they are often used to stifle dissent and target marginalized communities. The withdrawal of charges in this case may prompt a broader discussion about the need for reforms in the application of sedition laws.\n"

    "prompt": "Influential R&B singer songwriter Don Covay, whose songs were performed by the Rolling Stones, Otis Redding and Aretha Franklin, has died aged 76.",
    "HWT": "His daughter, Ursula, confirmed the singer's death to The Washington Post. He died in a New York hospital earlier this week from complications following a stroke. Covay gave Aretha Franklin one of her biggest hits with Chain of Fools in 1968, a song he had written 15 years earlier. His singing style also influenced Mick Jagger, as seen in the Rolling Stones cover of his song Mercy Mercy. Covay started out in music in a gospel group with his siblings at school, before joining doo-wop group Rainbows. While trying to make it as a solo artist and singer-songwriter he spent time as Little Richard's chauffeur and warm-up act. His first chart hit came in 1961 with Pony Time. The track, however, became an even bigger hit when Chubby Checker recorded his own version a year later in 1962, topping the pop and R&B charts. This pattern continued with his song Mercy Mercy, which he recorded in 1964 with a then-unknown Jimi Hendrix on guitar, which went into the top 40. A year later the Rolling Stones recorded their own version for their album Out of Our Heads, causing many to point out the similarity in singing styles between Jagger and Covay. While working as a songwriter at the Brill Building in New York, Covay wrote for artists including Gladys Knight and the Pips, Wilson Pickett and Solomon Burke. He was also part of the short-lived group the Soul Clan which featured Burke, Joe Tex, Ben E King and Arthur Conley. His work has been covered by a wide variety of artists including Gene Vincent, Connie Francis, Steppenwolf, Bobby Womack and the Small Faces. Covay suffered a stroke in 1992 and a year later stars including Ronnie Wood, Iggy Pop and Todd Rundgren produced a tribute album entitled Back to the Streets: Celebrating the Music of Don Covay. After a gap of 23 years Covay released his last album Ad Lib in 2000, which featured Rolling Stones guitarists Ronnie Woods and Keith Richards, Bad Company vocalist Paul Rodgers, Wilson Pickett, Syl Johnson and Huey Lewis.",
    "MGT": "Don Covay, the prolific and influential R&B singer and songwriter whose work resonated across generations and was covered by some of the biggest names in music, has passed away at the age of 76. Covay's death marks the end of an era for rhythm and blues, a genre he helped shape with his distinctive voice and songwriting prowess.\n\nBorn Donald Randolph in Orangeburg, South Carolina, Covay's musical journey began in the church, singing gospel alongside his family. This early exposure instilled in him a deep understanding of rhythm, harmony, and the power of emotional delivery, elements that would become hallmarks of his signature sound.\n\nCovay's career took off in the late 1950s, and by the 1960s, he had established himself as a force to be reckoned with. His songwriting talents were highly sought after, and his compositions became hits for a diverse range of artists. The Rolling Stones put their raw, blues-infused spin on his song \"Mercy, Mercy,\" while Otis Redding delivered a soulful and unforgettable rendition of \"Chain of Fools,\" which later became an anthem for Aretha Franklin.\n\nBeyond these iconic covers, Covay also enjoyed success as a performer in his own right. His songs, such as \"See Saw\" and \"Pony Time,\" topped the R&B charts and showcased his energetic stage presence. Covay's music often addressed social issues, reflecting the turbulent times in which he lived and adding a layer of depth to his work.\n\nCovay's impact on music extends far beyond the hits he wrote and performed. He was a pioneer, blending gospel, blues, and soul to create a sound that was both timeless and uniquely his own. His influence can be heard in the work of countless artists who followed, and his songs continue to be celebrated for their emotional power and musical innovation.\n\nHe is survived by his children and grandchildren. His legacy will endure through his recordings and the many artists he influenced.\n"

    "prompt": "A man accused of murdering his landlord told his trial he \"lost control\" after a request for sexual favours.",
    "HWT": "David Craig Ellis, 41, has admitted killing Alec Warburton, 59, at a house in Sketty, Swansea, but denies murder. Swansea Crown Court has heard that unemployed Mr Ellis could not afford his rent and Mr Warburton suggested \"things of a sexual nature\" instead. Mr Ellis told the jury his experience of being sexually abused as a child had triggered the fatal attack. Mr Ellis said his landlord had \"barged\" into his bedroom and reminded him his rent was in arrears. Mr Ellis said he felt angry due to the suggestion he could give sexual favours in lieu of rent and he tried to punch Mr Warburton after he cupped his face. \"I was abused as a child. The height difference made me feel like a child again,\" said Mr Ellis. He said he picked up a screwdriver and tried to stab Mr Warburton but the attempt was unsuccessful. The jury was told Mr Ellis eventually managed to kick his landlord in the groin causing him to drop to one knee. Christopher Clee QC, prosecuting, said: \"At that stage he was of no threat to you at all, was he?\" Mr Ellis replied: \"I don't know what I was thinking at the time.\" The court then heard how Mr Ellis picked up a hammer and struck Mr Warburton on the back of the head. Mr Clee asked Mr Ellis: \"You hit him from behind with such force you made a hole in his skull, didn't you?\" He replied: \"Yes.\" Mr Clee added: \"You caved that man's head skull in - what were you doing?\" Mr Ellis said: \" I don't know, I lost control.\" The trial continues.",
    "MGT": "A defendant on trial for the murder of his landlord testified that he \"lost control\" after the victim allegedly propositioned him for sexual favors. The defendant, identified as Mark Jenkins, took the stand yesterday in the courtroom of Judge Sarah Miller, recounting the events leading up to the death of Thomas Abernathy last October.\n\nJenkins claimed that Abernathy, his landlord for the past six months, had made repeated advances, which he consistently rebuffed. He stated that on the night of the incident, Abernathy had cornered him in the kitchen of their shared residence, making explicit demands in exchange for reduced rent.\n\n\"I told him no, like I always did,\" Jenkins said, his voice wavering slightly. \"But he wouldn't let it go. He kept pushing, getting closer. I felt trapped, disgusted.\"\n\nAccording to Jenkins' testimony, a heated argument ensued, escalating rapidly. He alleged that Abernathy became aggressive, physically restraining him. It was at this point, Jenkins claims, that he \"lost control.\"\n\n\"Everything went blurry,\" he recounted. \"I just reacted. I didn't mean for any of this to happen.\"\n\nThe prosecution, led by District Attorney Patricia Davies, challenged Jenkins' account, highlighting inconsistencies in his initial statement to police. Davies pointed to forensic evidence, including blood spatter patterns, which she argued contradicted Jenkins' version of events.\n\n\"The evidence suggests a prolonged and violent struggle, not a momentary lapse in judgment,\" Davies stated during cross-examination. She further questioned why Jenkins had not reported the alleged harassment to authorities prior to the incident.\n\nThe trial, which is expected to last two weeks, has garnered significant public attention. Friends and family of both the defendant and the victim have been present in the courtroom each day, their emotions palpable. Abernathy is remembered by his neighbors as a quiet, unassuming man who kept to himself. Jenkins, on the other hand, had a reputation for being a reliable and hardworking tenant.\n\nThe jury will ultimately have to decide whether Jenkins acted in self-defense, as his defense attorney argues, or whether he is guilty of murder. The case hinges on their interpretation of the evidence and their assessment of Jenkins' credibility. Closing arguments are scheduled for next week.\n"

    "HWT": "Darren Grayson has stepped down from the East Sussex Healthcare NHS Trust, which runs the Conquest Hospital in St Leonards and Eastbourne District General Hospital (EDGH). In March the Care Quality Commission said A&E waiting times were \"excessive\" and targets were being missed. Campaigners have called for the resignation of the board of the trust. Mr Grayson said: \"Having been chief executive in East Sussex for five years, and having led the organisation through some significant change to improve the quality of our services for patients, I believe the time is now right to hand the baton to the next leader to continue this journey of improvement.\" In its latest report in March, the CQC said it had particular concerns over outpatient records and surgical practices at the EDGH. Liz Walke, chairwoman of the Save the DGH Campaign, said: \"It's a start. Let's be clear, that it isn't just Darren Grayson. We think the board should go and, unless you have a clean sweep, no significant change will happen. \"We hope there isn't going to be a massive payout. We are hoping that he has just fallen on his sword.\" Former Liberal Democrat MP for Eastbourne Stephen Lloyd said: \"It's about time. \"Frankly, I called for it a good 18 months ago. He still appeared to be hanging on for grim death to the post. I just thought it was absolutely outrageous.\"",
    "MGT": "Marianne Griffiths, the chief executive overseeing two Sussex hospitals recently deemed inadequate by the Care Quality Commission (CQC), has resigned from her position. Her departure follows a highly critical report detailing significant failings in patient safety and overall management at both the Royal Sussex County Hospital in Brighton and the Princess Royal Hospital in Haywards Heath.\n\nThe CQC report, published last month, highlighted a multitude of concerns, including long waiting times, understaffing, and inadequate infection control measures. Inspectors also raised serious questions about the leadership's ability to address these systemic problems effectively.\n\nGriffiths had been in the role for several years, navigating the challenges of a complex and under-resourced healthcare system. Her resignation marks a significant turning point for the University Hospitals Sussex NHS Foundation Trust, which manages the two hospitals.\n\nThe trust has announced that an interim chief executive will be appointed shortly to ensure a smooth transition while the search for a permanent replacement begins. The focus will be on finding a leader capable of implementing the necessary changes to improve patient care and address the issues raised by the CQC. The hospitals remain under intense scrutiny as they work to rectify the identified shortcomings and regain the public's trust. The new leadership will face the immediate challenge of reassuring staff and patients alike that meaningful improvements are underway.\n"

    "prompt": "Postal business Whistl has confirmed it is ending its home delivery service in London, Liverpool and Manchester, putting up to 1,800 jobs at risk.",
    "HWT": "The Dutch-owned firm suspended deliveries last month after losing funding. It had been delivering about 3m letters every week in the three cities, in direct competition with Royal Mail. The private equity arm of Lloyds bank decided not to invest, triggering a review. Parent group PostNL said the firm had begun a consultation with affected staff \"to minimise the impact of the decision\". The company also pointed out it would continue to collect 80m items a week to be fed into the Royal Mail system for final delivery. A statement released by PostNL said: \"Following the termination of the discussions on the proposed investment in Whistl UK to fund the further rollout of its current end-to-end (E2E) activities, we have assessed alternative scenarios for Whistl's E2E operations. \"Further to this assessment, it has been decided to end Whistl's E2E operations. \"Whistl remains committed to further developing its successful activities in the UK, including downstream access (DSA) service, door-drop media, packets and parcels and logistics.\" About 1,800 workers were employed by Whistl, with many on zero-hours contracts. Whistl is the second largest postal operator in the UK.",
    "MGT": "Postal delivery firm Whistl has announced it will cease its door-to-door delivery service in London, Liverpool, and Manchester, potentially impacting up to 1,800 jobs. The company cited unsustainable losses as the primary driver behind the decision, despite significant investment and efforts to improve efficiency.\n\nThe move marks a significant scaling back of Whistl's ambitions to challenge Royal Mail's dominance in the UK postal market. Launched with considerable fanfare, the home delivery service aimed to provide a competitive alternative for businesses seeking to distribute leaflets, brochures, and other unaddressed mail. However, the company has struggled to achieve the necessary density and volume to make the operation profitable in these urban centers.\n\n\"This was a difficult decision, and we understand the impact it will have on our employees,\" a Whistl spokesperson said in a released statement. \"We have explored all available options, but regrettably, we have been unable to find a sustainable path forward for the service in these locations.\"\n\nThe company stated it will be entering into consultations with affected employees to discuss potential redeployment opportunities within other parts of the business or to provide support in finding alternative employment. Whistl affirmed its commitment to fulfilling its obligations to its workforce throughout this transition.\n\nWhile the home delivery service will be discontinued in the three metropolitan areas, Whistl emphasized that it will continue to operate its other core services, including downstream access mail delivery, parcels, and logistics solutions, across the UK. The company maintains that it remains a significant player in the postal and delivery sector, serving a wide range of businesses.\n\nIndustry analysts suggest that the Whistl's decision reflects the challenges facing alternative postal operators in competing with Royal Mail's established infrastructure and universal service obligation. The high costs associated with building a comprehensive delivery network, coupled with fluctuating volumes and increasing competition from digital channels, have created a difficult environment for new entrants. The future of the postal market is still uncertain.\n"
