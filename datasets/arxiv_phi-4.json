    "HWT": "Aims. With the Solar Optical Telescope on Hinode, we investigate the basic properties of high-degree solar oscillations observed at two levels in the solar atmosphere, in the G-band (formed in the photosphere) and in the Ca II H line (chromospheric emission). Methods. We analyzed the data by calculating the individual power spectra as well as the cross-spectral properties, i.e., coherence and phase shift. The observational properties are compared with a simple theoretical model, which includes the effects of correlated noise. Results. The results reveal significant frequency shifts between the Ca II H and G-band spectra, in particular above the acoustic cut-off frequency for pseudo-modes. The cross-spectrum phase shows peaks associated with the acoustic oscillation (p-mode) lines, and begins to increase with frequency around the acoustic cut-off. However, we find no phase shift for the (surface gravity wave) f-mode. The observed properties for the p-modes are qualitatively reproduced in a simple model with a correlated background if the correlated noise level in the Ca II H data is higher than in the G-band data. These results suggest that multi-wavelength observations of solar oscillations, in combination with the traditional intensity-velocity observations, may help to determine the level of the correlated background noise and to determine the type of wave excitation sources on the Sun.",

The analysis includes a comprehensive examination of frequency shifts, mode lifetimes, and the effects of solar activity on these oscillations. Utilizing advanced helioseismic techniques, we derive detailed mode parameters, enabling a comparison with theoretical models of solar interior dynamics. The results reveal significant variations in oscillation properties correlated with solar activity cycles, emphasizing the sensitivity of high-degree modes to changes in the magnetic environment. Furthermore, the study examines the damping rates of these modes, providing evidence for the role of turbulent convection in energy dissipation.

    "HWT": "The paper deals with a problem of interaction between hydrodynamics and mechanics of nonlinear elastic bodies. The existence question for two-dimensional symmetric steady waves travelling on the surface of a deep ocean beneath a heavy elastic membrane is analyzed as a problem in bifurcation theory. The behaviour of the two-dimensional cross-section of the membrane is modelled as a thin (unshearable), heavy, hyperelastic Cosserat rod, following Antman's elasticity theory, and the fluid beneath is supposed to be in steady 2D irrotational motion under gravity. Assuming that gravity and the density of the undeformed membrane are prescribed, the free parameters of the problem are the speed of the wave and drift velocity of the membrane. The analysis relies upon a conformal formulation of the hydro-elastic problem developed in previous papers; the basic tool for the study of the bifurcation picture is the implicit function theorem, under some non-resonance assumptions. The most interesting part of the final result is the existence of a symmetry-breaking 'third sheet' of solutions, which bifurcates from primary sheets, and is a hydro-elastic analogue of the phenomenon known as 'Wilton ripples' in the surface tension case.",

The primary focus is on the conditions under which primary bifurcations occur, leading to the emergence of new wave patterns. We employ a perturbation method to derive the amplitude equations governing the wave evolution, revealing the critical thresholds for bifurcation onset. Subsequently, the study examines secondary bifurcations, where further wave pattern modifications arise, influenced by nonlinear interactions and elastic deformations. Our findings demonstrate that both the wave amplitude and structural elasticity significantly impact the bifurcation scenarios. The results highlight the intricate interplay between fluid dynamics and structural responses, providing insights into the design and analysis of marine structures subjected to dynamic wave forces.

    "HWT": "I assume a universe whereby the speed of light and the planck constant are not constants but instead parameters that vary locally in time-and space. When describing motion, I am able to derive a modified path integral description at the quantum level, which offers a natural extension of quantum mechanics. At the microscopic level, this path integral intuitively describes a physics with many quantum realities thus leading to a novel concept of manifold of physics, which can be looked at as a novel action principle. This paradigm reflects the notion that the observed laws of physics on any given scale are determined by the underlying distribution of the fundamental parameters (i. e Quantum Mechanics is just one point on this manifold), thus leading to many possible physical-law based behaviors. By choosing a Gaussian distribution of the parameters, a quadratic action term appears in the path-integral, which in turns leads to a complex classical action (and by continuation a new description for inertia) at the classical level. In the accompanying manuscript the classical doublet equation of motion is applied to the Newtonian gravitation field, and a MOND-like, dark-energy-like, and pioneer-anomaly-like solutions are derived.",

    "HWT": "We demonstrate that the chaotic nature of N-body systems can lead to macroscopic variations in the evolution of collisionless simulations containing rotationally supported discs. The unavoidable stochasticity that afflicts all simulations generally causes mild differences between the evolution of similar models but, in order to illustrate that this is not always true, we present a case that shows extreme bimodal divergence. The divergent behaviour occurs in two different types of code and is independent of all numerical parameters. We identify and give explicit illustrations of several sources of stochasticity, and also show that macroscopic variations in the evolution can originate from differences at the round-off error level. We obtain somewhat more consistent results from simulations in which the halo is set up with great care compared with those started from more approximate equilibria, but we have been unable to eliminate diverging behaviour entirely because the main sources of stochasticity are intrinsic to the disc. We show that the divergence is only temporary and that halo friction is merely delayed, for a substantial time in some cases. We argue that the delays are unlikely to arise in real galaxies, and that our results do not affect dynamical friction constraints on halo density. Stochastic variations in the evolution are inevitable in all simulations of disc-halo systems, irrespective of how they were created, although their effect is generally far less extreme than we find here. The possibility of divergent behaviour complicates comparison of results from different workers.",

The resulting photometry is merged with that at JHKs from 2MASS and a more spatially limited $BVI$ survey from previous ground-based work. We use a mixture of color- color diagrams to select a minimally contaminated set of more than 1600 objects that we claim are young stellar objects (YSOs) associated with the star forming region. Because our selection technique uses IR excess as a requirement, our sample is strongly biased against inclusion of Class III YSOs. The distribution of IRAC spectral slopes for our YSOs indicates that most of these objects are Class II, with a peak towards steeper spectral slopes but a substantial contribution from a tail of flat spectrum and Class I type objects. By studying the small fraction of the sample that is optically visible, we infer a typical age of a few Myr for the low mass population. The young stars are clustered, with about a third of them located in eight clusters that are located within or near the LDN 935 dark cloud.

    "HWT": "Recent experiments on triangular lattice organic Mott insulators have found evidence for a 2D spin liquid in proximity to the metal-insulator transition. A Gutzwiller wavefunction study of the triangular lattice Heisenberg model with appropriate four-spin ring exchanges has found that the projected spinon Fermi sea state has a low variational energy. This wavefunction, together with a slave particle gauge theory, suggests that such spin liquid possesses spin correlations that are singular along surfaces in momentum space (\"Bose surfaces\"). Signatures of this state, which we refer to as a \"Spin Bose-Metal\" (SBM), are expected to be manifest in quasi-1D ladder systems: The discrete transverse momenta cut through the 2D Bose surface leading to a distinct pattern of 1D gapless modes. Here we search for a quasi-1D descendant of the triangular lattice SBM state by exploring the Heisenberg plus ring model on a two-leg strip (zigzag chain). Using DMRG, variational wavefunctions, and a Bosonization analysis, we map out the full phase diagram. Without ring exchange the model is equivalent to the J_1 - J_2 Heisenberg chain, and we find the expected Bethe-chain and dimerized phases. Remarkably, moderate ring exchange reveals a new gapless phase over a large swath of the phase diagram. Spin and dimer correlations possess particular singular wavevectors and allow us to identify this phase as the hoped for quasi-1D descendant SBM state. We derive a low energy theory and find three gapless modes and one Luttinger parameter controlling all power laws. Potential instabilities out of the zigzag SBM give rise to other interesting phases such as a period-3 VBS or a period-4 Chirality order, which we discover in the DMRG; we also find an interesting SBM state with partial ferromagnetism.",

Employing a combination of density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) techniques and analytical approaches, we delve into the intricate phase diagram of this system, emphasizing the interplay between geometric frustration and quantum fluctuations. Our findings suggest that the incorporation of ring exchange interactions leads to the stabilization of a novel SBM phase, distinguished by its unique properties such as gapless spin excitations and a finite spin stiffness.\n\nThe investigation begins with a detailed examination of the model's Hamiltonian, which incorporates both nearest-neighbor Heisenberg exchange and ring exchange terms. Through extensive numerical simulations, we demonstrate that the system transitions from a conventional spin liquid phase to the SBM phase as the strength of the ring exchange interaction is increased. This transition is marked by the absence of long-range magnetic order and the presence of a non-trivial topological structure in the spin correlation functions.\n\nTo further elucidate the nature of the SBM phase, we analyze the dynamical spin structure factor and entanglement entropy, revealing the presence of characteristic features such as a power-law decay in correlation functions and a logarithmic divergence in entanglement entropy. These observations are consistent with the theoretical predictions for a Bose-metal phase, indicating the presence of deconfined spin excitations that exhibit metallic-like behavior.\n\nOur study also explores the implications of finite-size effects and boundary conditions, highlighting their influence on the stability and observability of the SBM phase.

    "HWT": "Secure multi-party computation is a central problem in modern cryptography. An important sub-class of this are problems of the following form: Alice and Bob desire to produce sample(s) of a pair of jointly distributed random variables. Each party must learn nothing more about the other party's output than what its own output reveals. To aid in this, they have available a set up - correlated random variables whose distribution is different from the desired distribution - as well as unlimited noiseless communication. In this paper we present an upperbound on how efficiently a given set up can be used to produce samples from a desired distribution. The key tool we develop is a generalization of the concept of common information of two dependent random variables [Gacs-Korner, 1973]. Our generalization - a three-dimensional region - remedies some of the limitations of the original definition which captured only a limited form of dependence. It also includes as a special case Wyner's common information [Wyner, 1975]. To derive the cryptographic bounds, we rely on a monotonicity property of this region: the region of the \"views\" of Alice and Bob engaged in any protocol can only monotonically expand and not shrink. Thus, by comparing the regions for the target random variables and the given random variables, we obtain our upperbound.",

One such variant which attracted a lot of attention in the recent years is the LIST MATRIX PARTITION problem. In 2004 Cameron et al.

Our approach is based on a combinatorial problem known to be at least as hard as the STUBBORN PROBLEM - the 3-COMPATIBLE COLOURING problem. In this problem we are given a complete graph with each edge assigned one of 3 possible colours and we want to assign one of those 3 colours to each vertex in such a way that no edge has the same colour as both of its endpoints.

Using a combination of density functional theory and tight-binding models, we derive an expression for the crossover factor that effectively bridges the two-dimensional electronic structure of graphene with the three-dimensional band structure of graphite. Our results indicate that this factor plays a crucial role in tuning the electronic, optical, and transport properties of graphene-based materials as they approach the graphite limit. Experimental observations, including angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and scanning tunneling microscopy, corroborate the theoretical predictions, demonstrating the significant impact of interlayer coupling variations on the electronic band structure. This universal exponential factor not only enhances our understanding of the fundamental physics governing layered materials but also offers novel insights for engineering graphene-based devices with tailored properties."

    "HWT": "Portfolio balancing requires estimates of covariance between asset returns. Returns data have histories which greatly vary in length, since assets begin public trading at different times. This can lead to a huge amount of missing data--too much for the conventional imputation-based approach. Fortunately, a well-known factorization of the MVN likelihood under the prevailing historical missingness pattern leads to a simple algorithm of OLS regressions that is much more reliable. When there are more assets than returns, however, OLS becomes unstable. Gramacy, et al. (2008), showed how classical shrinkage regression may be used instead, thus extending the state of the art to much bigger asset collections, with further accuracy and interpretation advantages. In this paper, we detail a fully Bayesian hierarchical formulation that extends the framework further by allowing for heavy-tailed errors, relaxing the historical missingness assumption, and accounting for estimation risk. We illustrate how this approach compares favorably to the classical one using synthetic data and an investment exercise with real returns. An accompanying R package is on CRAN.",

Addressing the challenge of incomplete data in multivariate contexts, our method incorporates a shrinkage estimator to enhance predictive accuracy and parameter estimation. By integrating a missing data imputation mechanism with a ridge-type shrinkage penalty, we effectively manage the bias-variance trade-off inherent in traditional regression techniques. Our approach leverages Bayesian frameworks to handle uncertainty in parameter estimation, accommodating both observed and missing data seamlessly. Through extensive simulations, we demonstrate that our shrinkage regression model outperforms conventional methods in terms of prediction accuracy and robustness to missing data structures. We apply the proposed methodology to portfolio balancing, where missing financial data is a common obstacle. By employing our shrinkage regression model, we achieve improved portfolio performance and risk assessment, underscoring the practical utility of our approach in financial applications.

The exception presented here to the Kesden and Kamionkowski demonstration that an LRSI tends to produce distinctly asymmetric streams follows if the LRSI is strong enough to separate the stars from the dark matter before tidal disruption of the stellar component, and if stars dominate the mass in the luminous part of the satellite. It requires that the Sgr galaxy now contains little dark matter, which may be consistent with the Sgr stellar velocity dispersion, for in the simulation the dispersion at pericenter exceeds virial.

We study the influence of the tidal charge onto profiled spectral lines generated by radiating tori orbiting in vicinity of a rotating black hole. We show that with lowering the negative tidal charge of the black hole, the profiled line becomes to be flatter and wider keeping their standard character with flux stronger at the blue edge of the profiled line. The extension of the line grows with radius falling and inclination angle growing. With growing inclination angle a small hump appears in the profiled lines due to the strong lensing effect of photons coming from regions behind the black hole. For positive tidal charge ($b>0$) and high inclination angles two small humps appear in the profiled lines close to the red and blue edge of the lines due to the strong lensing effect. We can conclude that for all values of $b$, the strongest effect on the profiled lines shape (extension) is caused by the changes of the inclination angle.",

We show that the gamma-ray albedo for the Main Belt, Trojans, and Kuiper Belt strongly depends on the small-body size distribution of each system. Based on an analysis of the Energetic Gamma Ray Experiment Telescope (EGRET) data we infer that the diffuse emission from the MBAs, Trojans, and KBOs has an integrated flux of less than ~6x10^{-6} cm^{-2} s^{-1} (100-500 MeV), which corresponds to ~12 times the Lunar albedo, and may be detectable by the forthcoming Gamma Ray Large Area Space Telescope (GLAST). If detected by GLAST, it can provide unique direct information about the number of small bodies in each system that is difficult to assess by any other method. Additionally, the KBO albedo flux can be used to probe the spectrum of CR nuclei at close-to-interstellar conditions.

Both the origin and the spatial structure of galaxy clusters magnetic fields are still under debate. In particular, the radial profile of the magnetic field, from the core of clusters to their outskirts, is of great importance for cosmic rays propagation within the Cosmic Web. In this letter, we highlight the importance of cooling processes in amplifying the magnetic field in the core of galaxy clusters up to one order of magnitude above the typical amplification obtained for a pure adiabatic evolution. We have performed a \"zoom'' cosmological simulation of a 3 keV cluster, including dark matter and gas dynamics, atomic cooling, UV heating and star formation using the newly developed MHD solver in the AMR code RAMSES. Magnetic field amplification proceeds mainly through gravitational contraction. Shearing motions due to turbulence provide additional amplification in the outskirts of the cluster, while magnetic reconnection during mergers causes magnetic field dissipation in the core. Cooling processes have a strong impact on the magnetic field structure in the cluster. First, due to the sharp rise of the gas density in the centre, gravitational amplification is significantly amplified, when compared to the non--radiative run. Second, due to cooling processes, shearing motions are much stronger in the core than in the adiabatic case, leading to additional field amplification and no significant magnetic reconnection.",

The dusty circumnuclear environment is spatially resolved and the wavelength dependence of the compact emission is discussed. The observations were carried out with the MIDI instrument at the Very Large Telescope Interferometer in the N-band. Spectra and visibilities were derived with a spectral resolution of 30 in the wavelength range from 8 to 13 micron. For the interpretation we developed a simple dusty disk model with small and variable covering factor. At baselines of 65 and 69 m, visibilities in the range of 0.4 to 0.7 were measured. The N-band spectra show a monotonic increase of the measured flux with wavelength with no apparent silicate feature around 10 micron. We find that the mid-IR emission from the nucleus can be reproduced by an extended dust disk or torus with a small covering factor of the radiating dust clouds. Our mid-IR observations of NGC 3783 are consistent with a clumpy circumnuclear dust environment. The interpretation in terms of a dusty torus with low covering factor supports a clumpy version of the unified scheme for AGN. The inferred sizes and luminosities are in good agreement with dust reverberation sizes and bolometric luminosities from optical and X-ray observations.",

This study utilizes the groundbreaking capabilities of the MIDI/VLTI interferometry to probe the spatial distribution and composition of the dust within a few parsecs of the AGN. Our observations, conducted in the mid-infrared spectral range, reveal a complex morphology characterized by a centrally concentrated dust distribution with an extended halo, suggesting a clumpy medium with varying optical depths. Through detailed modeling, we ascertain that the dust is predominantly composed of silicates with a temperature gradient indicative of reprocessing of the AGN's intense radiation field. The interferometric data yield unprecedented spatial resolution, allowing us to resolve structures as small as 0.5 milliarcseconds, equivalent to approximately 3.2 AU at the distance of NGC 3783. The dust configuration appears to be dynamically influenced by the AGN, with potential contributions from a dusty torus and possible circumbinary material. Our analysis also addresses the variability observed in the infrared spectrum, linking it to changes in the AGN's luminosity and the consequent reprocessing by the surrounding dust. These findings enhance our understanding of the interplay between the AGN and its dusty environment, providing critical insights into the mechanisms driving AGN feedback and the conditions necessary for the coexistence of AGN and starburst activities within such galaxies.",

    "HWT": "We consider the analogues of the Horn inequalities in finite von Neumann algebras, which concern the possible spectral distributions of sums $a+b$ of self--adjoint elements $a$ and $b$ in a finite von Neumann algebra. It is an open question whether all of these Horn inequalities must hold in all finite von Neumann algebras, and this is related to Connes' embedding problem. For each choice of integers $1\\le r\\le n$, there is a set $T^n_r$ of Horn triples, and the Horn inequalities are in one-to-one correspondence with $\\cup_{1\\le r\\le n}T^n_r$. We consider a property P$_n$, analogous to one introduced by Therianos and Thompson in the case of matrices, amounting to the existence of projections having certain properties relative to arbitrary flags, which guarantees that a given Horn inequality holds in all finite von Neumann algebras. It is an open question whether all Horn triples in $T^n_r$ have property P$_n$. Certain triples in $T^n_r$ can be reduced to triples in $T^{n-1}_r$ by an operation we call {\\em TT--reduction}. We show that property P$_n$ holds for the original triple if property P$_{n-1}$ holds for the reduced one. We then characterize the TT--irreducible Horn triples in $T^n_3$, for arbitrary $n$, and for those LR--minimal ones (namely, those having Littlewood--Richardson coefficient equal to 1), we perform a construction of projections with respect to flags in arbitrary von Neumann algebras in order to prove property P$_n$ for them. This shows that all LR--minimal triples in $\\cup_{n\\ge3}T^n_3$ have property P$_n$, and so that the corresponding Horn inequalities hold in all finite von Neumann algebras.",

For the {\\it dynamically long-range} case, i.e., a \\leq d-1, on the other hand, the dominant contribution to the force comes from the mean field due to the bulk, which becomes undefined in this limit. We discuss also how, for a \\leq d-1 (and notably, for the case of gravity, a=d-2) P(F) may, in some cases, be defined in a weaker sense. This involves a regularization of the force summation which is generalization of the procedure employed to define gravitational forces in an infinite static homogeneous universe. We explain that the relevant classification in this context is, however, that which divides pair forces with a > d-2 (or a < d-2), for which the PDF of the {\\it difference in forces} is defined (or not defined) in the infinite system limit, without any regularization. In the former case dynamics can, as for the (marginal) case of gravity, be defined consistently in an infinite uniform system.",

    "HWT": "Context: L1448-mm is the prototype of a low-mass Class 0 protostar driving a high-velocity jet. Given its bright H2O spectra observed with ISO, L1448-mm is an ideal laboratory to observe heavy water (HDO) emission. Aims: Our aim is to image the HDO emission in the protostar surroundings, the possible occurrence of HDO emission also investigating off L1448-mm, towards the molecular outflow. Methods: We carried out observations of L1448-mm in the HDO(1_10-1_11) line at 80.6 GHz, an excellent tracer of HDO column density, with the IRAM Plateau de Bure Interferometer. Results: We image for the first time HDO emission around L1448-mm. The HDO structure reveals a main clump at velocities close to the ambient one towards the the continuum peak that is caused by the dust heated by the protostar. In addition, the HDO map shows tentative weaker emission at about 2000 AU from the protostar towards the south, which is possibly associated with the walls of the outflow cavity opened by the protostellar wind. Conclusions: Using an LVG code, modelling the density and temperature profile of the hot-corino, and adopting a gas temperature of 100 K and a density of 1.5 10^8 cm^-3, we derive a beam diluted HDO column density of about 7 10^13 cm^-2, corresponding to a HDO abundance of about 4 10^-7. In addition, the present map supports the scenario where HDO can be efficiently produced in shocked regions and not uniquely in hot corinos heated by the newly born star.",

Our goal is threefold: to determine basic physical properties of the supernova ejecta, such as velocity, temperature, and density gradients; to reproduce He I absorption lines by invoking non-thermal excitation; and, to investigate possible spectral signatures of hydrogen, especially a feature around 6200 Angstrom, which has been attributed to high velocity $H_\\alpha$.

The near-infrared spectra for 5 of 12 Upper Scorpius sources exhibit Pa-gamma, Pa-beta and Br-gamma emission, indicators of disk accretion.

    "HWT": "The approach to reasoning about structural operational semantics style specifications supported by the Abella system is discussed. This approach uses lambda tree syntax to treat object language binding and encodes binding related properties in generic judgments. Further, object language specifications are embedded directly into the reasoning framework through recursive definitions. The treatment of binding via generic judgments implicitly enforces distinctness and atomicity in the names used for bound variables. These properties must, however, be made explicit in reasoning tasks. This objective can be achieved by allowing recursive definitions to also specify generic properties of atomic predicates. The utility of these various logical features in the Abella system is demonstrated through actual reasoning tasks. Brief comparisons with a few other logic based approaches are also made.",

By encoding SOS specifications within Abella, we demonstrate how automated reasoning can effectively check these properties, providing a rigorous foundation for understanding operational semantics. Our approach leverages Abella's support for higher-order patterns and rewrite rules, facilitating the representation of complex semantic behaviors.

    "HWT": "Since 2001, the radio quasar 3C 454.3 has undergone a period of high optical activity, culminating in the brightest optical state ever observed, during the 2004-2005 outburst. The Whole Earth Blazar Telescope (WEBT) consortium has carried out several multifrequency campaigns to follow the source behaviour. The GLAST-AGILE Support Program (GASP) was born from the WEBT to provide long-term continuous optical-to-radio monitoring of a sample of gamma-loud blazars, during the operation of the AGILE and GLAST (now known as Fermi GST) gamma-ray satellites. The main aim is to shed light on the mechanisms producing the high-energy radiation, through correlation analysis with the low-energy emission. Thus, since 2008 the monitoring task on 3C 454.3 passed from the WEBT to the GASP, while both AGILE and Fermi detected strong gamma-ray emission from the source. We present the main results obtained by the GASP at optical, mm, and radio frequencies in the 2008-2009 season, and compare them with the WEBT results from previous years. An optical outburst was observed to peak in mid July 2008, when Fermi detected the brightest gamma-ray levels. A contemporaneous mm outburst maintained its brightness for a longer time, until the cm emission also reached the maximum levels. The behaviour compared in the three bands suggests that the variable relative brightness of the different-frequency outbursts may be due to the changing orientation of a curved inhomogeneous jet. The optical light curve is very well sampled during the entire season, which is also well covered by the various AGILE and Fermi observing periods. The relevant cross-correlation studies will be very important in constraining high-energy emission models.",

After identifying some benchmark points in the parameter space of a supergravity scenario with non-universal scalar masses, we study a few specific classes of signals, namely, stop pair production and gluino pair production followed by each decaying into a stop and a top. It is shown that proper kinematic cuts remove the backgrounds in each case, and, while a few months' worth of data is sufficient to have copious events in the first case, one may require 300 $fb^{-1}$ for the other.

    "HWT": "We investigate the possibility to construct a generalization of the Standard Model, which we call the Maximal Mass Model because it contains a limiting mass $M$ for its fundamental constituents. The parameter $M$ is considered as a new universal physical constant of Nature and therefore is called the fundamental mass. It is introduced in a purely geometrical way, like the velocity of light as a maximal velocity in the special relativity. If one chooses the Euclidean formulation of quantum field theory, the adequate realization of the limiting mass hypothesis is reduced to the choice of the de Sitter geometry as the geometry of the 4-momentum space. All fields, defined in de Sitter p-space in configurational space obey five dimensional Klein-Gordon type equation with fundamental mass $M$ as a mass parameter. The role of dynamical field variables is played by the Cauchy initial conditions given at $x_5 = 0$, guarantying the locality and gauge invariance principles. The corresponding to the geometrical requirements formulation of the theory of scalar, vector and spinor fields is considered in some detail. On a simple example it is demonstrated that the spontaneously symmetry breaking mechanism leads to renormalization of the fundamental mass $M$. A new geometrical concept of the chirality of the fermion fields is introduced. It would be responsible for new measurable effects at high energies $E \\geq M$. Interaction terms of a new type, due to the existence of the Higgs boson are revealed. The most intriguing prediction of the new approach is the possible existence of exotic fermions with no analogues in the SM, which may be candidate for dark matter constituents.",

This is one in a series of papers in which we discuss issues involved in deriving accurate 3-He/H abundance ratios from the available measurements. Here we describe the ionization correction we use to convert the 3-He+/H+ abundance, y3+, to the 3-He/H abundance, y3. In principle the nebular ionization structure can significantly influence the y3 derived for individual sources. We find that in general there is insufficient information available to make a detailed ionization correction. Here we make a simple correction and assess its validity. The correction is based on radio recombination line measurements of H+ and 4-He+, together with simple core-halo source models. We use these models to establish criteria that allow us to identify sources that can be accurately corrected for ionization and those that cannot. We argue that this effect cannot be very large for most of the sources in our observational sample. For a wide range of models of nebular ionization structure we find that the ionization correction factor varies from 1 to 1.8.

And the researchers show that the HD 128311 and HD 73526 planetary systems are involved in a 2:1 mean motion resonance but not in apsidal corotation, because one of the resonance argument circulates over the dynamical evolution. In this paper, we investigate potential mechanisms to form the 2:1 librating-circulating resonance configuration. In the late stage of planetary formation, scattering or colliding among planetesimals and planetary embryos can frequently occur. Hence, in our model, we consider a planetary configuration of two giants together with few terrestrial planets. We find that both colliding or scattering events at very early stage of dynamical evolution can influence the configurations trapped into resonance. A planet-planet scattering of a moderate terrestrial planet, or multiple scattering of smaller planets in a crowded planetary system can change the resonant configuration. In addition, collision or merging can alter the masses and location of the giant planets, which also play an important role in shaping the resonant configuration during the dynamical evolution. In this sense, the librating-circulating resonance configuration is more likely to form by a hybrid mechanism of scattering and collision.",

We present a new technique, Counts-in-Cylinders (CiC), to constrain the parameters of the satellite contribution to the LRG Halo-Occupation Distribution (HOD). For a fiber collision-corrected SDSS spectroscopic LRG subsample at 0.16 < z < 0.36, we find the CiC multiplicity function is fit by a halo model where the average number of satellites in a halo of mass M is <Nsat(M)> = ((M - Mcut)/M1)^alpha with Mcut = 5.0 +1.5/-1.3 (+2.9/-2.6) X 10^13 Msun, M1 = 4.95 +0.37/-0.26 (+0.79/-0.53) X 10^14 Msun, and alpha = 1.035 +0.10/-0.17 (+0.24/-0.31) at the 68% and 95% confidence levels using a WMAP3 cosmology and z=0.2 halo catalog.

We also find that mocks based on a halo catalog produced by a spherical overdensity (SO) finder reproduce both the measured CiC multiplicity function and the projected correlation function, while mocks based on a Friends-of-Friends (FoF) halo catalog has a deficit of close pairs at ~1 Mpc/h separations. Because the CiC method relies on higher order statistics of close pairs, it is robust to the choice of halo finder. In a companion paper we will apply this technique to optimize Finger-of-God (FOG) compression to eliminate the 1-halo contribution to the LRG power spectrum.",

    "HWT": "We present the first three-dimensional (3D) simulations of the large-scale mixing that takes place in the shock-heated stellar layers ejected in the explosion of a 15.5 solar-mass blue supergiant star. The outgoing supernova shock is followed from its launch by neutrino heating until it breaks out from the stellar surface more than two hours after the core collapse. Violent convective overturn in the post-shock layer causes the explosion to start with significant asphericity, which triggers the growth of Rayleigh-Taylor (RT) instabilities at the composition interfaces of the exploding star. Deep inward mixing of hydrogen (H) is found as well as fast-moving, metal-rich clumps penetrating with high velocities far into the H-envelope of the star as observed, e.g., in the case of SN 1987A. Also individual clumps containing a sizeable fraction of the ejected iron-group elements (up to several 0.001 solar masses) are obtained in some models. The metal core of the progenitor is partially turned over with Ni-dominated fingers overtaking oxygen-rich bullets and both Ni and O moving well ahead of the material from the carbon layer. Comparing with corresponding 2D (axially symmetric) calculations, we determine the growth of the RT fingers to be faster, the deceleration of the dense metal-carrying clumps in the He and H layers to be reduced, the asymptotic clump velocities in the H-shell to be higher (up to ~4500 km/s for the considered progenitor and an explosion energy of 10^{51} ergs, instead of <2000 km/s in 2D), and the outward radial mixing of heavy elements and inward mixing of hydrogen to be more efficient in 3D than in 2D. We present a simple argument that explains these results as a consequence of the different action of drag forces on moving objects in the two geometries. (abridged)",

This under-complete dictionary learning task can be formulated as a blind separation problem of sparse sources linearly mixed with an unknown orthogonal mixing matrix. This issue is formulated in a Bayesian framework. First, the unknown sparse sources are modeled as Bernoulli-Gaussian processes. To promote sparsity, a weighted mixture of an atom at zero and a Gaussian distribution is proposed as prior distribution for the unobserved sources. A non-informative prior distribution defined on an appropriate Stiefel manifold is elected for the mixing matrix. The Bayesian inference on the unknown parameters is conducted using a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method. A partially collapsed Gibbs sampler is designed to generate samples asymptotically distributed according to the joint posterior distribution of the unknown model parameters and hyperparameters. These samples are then used to approximate the joint maximum a posteriori estimator of the sources and mixing matrix. Simulations conducted on synthetic data are reported to illustrate the performance of the method for recovering sparse representations.

When extrapolating results of initially not mass segregated models to globular clusters, we obtain a correlation between the time until destruction and the slope of the mass function, in the sense that globular clusters which are closer to dissolution are more strongly depleted in low-mass stars. This correlation fits observed mass functions of most globular clusters. The mass functions of several globular clusters are however more strongly depleted in low-mass stars than suggested by these models. Such strongly depleted mass functions can be explained if globular clusters started initially mass segregated. Primordial mass segregation also explains the correlation between the slope of the stellar mass function and the cluster concentration which was recently discovered by De Marchi et al. (2007). In this case, it is possible that all globular clusters started with a mass function similar to that seen in young open clusters in the present-day universe, at least for stars below m=0.8 Msun. This argues for a near universality of the mass function for different star formation environments and metallicities in the range -2 < [Fe/H] < 0.

In physiological conditions, the system of neurons is very efficiently entrained by the 24-hour light-dark cycle. Most of the studies carried out so far emphasize the crucial role of the periodicity imposed by the light dark cycle in neuronal synchronization. Nevertheless, heterogeneity as a natural and permanent ingredient of these cellular interactions is seemingly to play a major role in these biochemical processes. In this paper we use a model that considers the neurons of the suprachiasmatic nucleus as chemically-coupled modified Goodwin oscillators, and introduce non-negligible heterogeneity in the periods of all neurons in the form of quenched noise. The system response to the light-dark cycle periodicity is studied as a function of the interneuronal coupling strength, external forcing amplitude and neuronal heterogeneity. Our results indicate that the right amount of heterogeneity helps the extended system to respond globally in a more coherent way to the external forcing. Our proposed mechanism for neuronal synchronization under external periodic forcing is based on heterogeneity-induced oscillators death, damped oscillators being more entrainable by the external forcing than the self-oscillating neurons with different periods.",

    "MGT_raw": "The synchronization and entrainment of coupled circadian oscillators are fundamental processes that underpin the temporal organization of biological rhythms across diverse organisms. This study investigates the mechanisms by which individual circadian oscillators synchronize with each other and align with external environmental cues, such as the light-dark cycle. Utilizing a combination of mathematical modeling and empirical data from genetically modified organisms, we explore how coupling strength, phase relationships, and feedback loops contribute to the collective behavior of oscillator networks. Our results demonstrate that both weak and strong coupling can lead to synchronization, depending on the intrinsic properties of the oscillators and the nature of the coupling functions. We identify critical parameters that influence the stability and robustness of synchronization, highlighting the role of non-linear interactions and time delays in entrainment processes. Additionally, we examine how perturbations, such as environmental fluctuations and genetic mutations, impact the coherence and resilience of synchronized states.

    "HWT": "The Cherenkov radio pulse emitted by hadronic showers in ice is calculated for showers of energies in the EeV range. This is obtained with three dimensional simulations of both shower development and the coherent radio pulse emitted as the excess charge develops in the shower. A Monte Carlo, ZHAireS, has been developed for this purpose combining the high energy hadronic interaction capabilities of AIRES, and the dense media propagation capabilities of TIERRAS, with the precise low energy tracking and specific algorithms developed to calculate the radio emission in ZHS. A thinning technique is implemented and optimized to allow the simulation of radio pulses induced by showers up to 10 EeV in ice. The code is validated comparing the results for electromagnetic and hadronic showers to those obtained with GEANT4 and ZHS codes. The contribution to the pulse of other shower particles in addition to electrons and positrons, mainly pions and muons, is found to be below 1%. The characteristics of hadronic showers and the corresponding Cherenkov frequency spectra are compared with those from purely electromagnetic showers. The dependence of the spectra on shower energy and high-energy hadronic model is addressed and parameterizations for the radio emission in hadronic showers in ice are given for practical applications.",

    "HWT": "The magnetorotational instability (MRI) is considered a key process for driving efficient angular momentum transport in astrophysical disks. Understanding its non-linear saturation constitutes a fundamental problem in modern accretion disk theory. The large dynamical range in physical conditions in accretion disks makes it challenging to address this problem only with numerical simulations. We analyze the concept that (secondary) parasitic instabilities are responsible for the saturation of the MRI. Our approach enables us to explore dissipative regimes that are relevant to astrophysical and laboratory conditions that lie beyond the regime accessible to current numerical simulations. We calculate the spectrum and physical structure of parasitic modes that feed off the fastest, exact (primary) MRI mode when its amplitude is such that the fastest parasitic mode grows as fast as the MRI. We argue that this \"saturation\" amplitude provides an estimate of the magnetic field that can be generated by the MRI before the secondary instabilities suppress its growth significantly. Recent works suggest that the saturation amplitude of the MRI depends mainly on the magnetic Prandtl number. Our results suggest that, as long as viscous effects do not dominate the fluid dynamics, the saturation level of the MRI depends only on the Elsasser number $\\Lambda_\\eta$. We calculate the ratio between the stress and the magnetic energy density, $\\alpha_{\\rm sat}\\beta_{\\rm sat}$, associated with the primary MRI mode. We find that for $\\Lambda_\\eta >1$ Kelvin-Helmholtz modes are responsible for saturation and $\\alpha_{\\rm sat}\\beta_{\\rm sat} = 0.4$, while for $\\Lambda_\\eta < 1$ tearing modes prevail and $\\alpha_{\\rm sat}\\beta_{\\rm sat} \\simeq 0.5 \\, \\Lambda_\\eta$.

At high temperatures (above the critical temperature Tc) the sound velocity is calculated from the recent lattice simulations of QCD, while in the low temperature region it is obtained from the hadron gas model. In the intermediate region we use different interpolations characterized by the values of the sound velocity at the local maximum (at T = 0.4 Tc) and local minimum (at T = Tc). In all considered cases the temperature dependent sound velocity functions yield the entropy density, which is consistent with the lattice QCD simulations at high temperature. Our calculations show that the presence of a distinct minimum of the sound velocity leads to a very long (about 20 fm/c) evolution time of the system, which is not compatible with the recent estimates based on the HBT interferometry. Hence, we conclude that the hydrodynamic description is favored in the case where the cross-over phase transition renders the smooth sound velocity function with a possible shallow minimum at Tc.",

The properties of extreme individual objects of the central stellar cluster contribute to our knowledge of star and dust formation close to a supermassive black hole. We initiated an interferometric experiment to understand IRS3 and investigate its properties as spectroscopic and interferometric reference star at 10um. VISIR imaging separates a compact source from diffuse, surrounding emission. The VLTI/MIDI instrument was used to measure visibilities at 10mas resolution of that compact 10um source, still unresolved by a single VLT. Photometry data were added to enable simple SED- and full radiative transfer-models of the data. The luminosity and size estimates show that IRS3 is probably a cool carbon star enshrouded by a complex dust distribution. Dust temperatures were derived. The coinciding interpretation of multiple datasets confirm dust emission at several spatial scales. The IF data resolve the innermost area of dust formation. Despite observed deep silicate absorption towards IRS3 we favor a carbon rich chemistry of the circumstellar dust shell. The silicate absorption most probably takes place in the outer diffuse dust, which is mostly ignored by MIDI measurements.

However, in doing such fits it is assumed that the sampled supernovae are moving with the Hubble flow, i.e. that their peculiar velocities are zero. In reality, peculiar velocities will modify supernova data in a way that can impact best-fit cosmological parameters. We theoretically quantify this effect in the nonlinear regime with a Monte-Carlo analysis, using data from semi-analytic galaxy catalogs that are built from the Millennium N-body simulation. We find scaling relations for the errors in best-fit parameters resulting solely from peculiar velocities, as a function of the total number of sources in a supernova survey N and its maximum redshift z_max. For low redshift surveys, we find that these errors can be of the same order of magnitude as the errors due to an intrinsic magnitude scatter of 0.1 mag. For a survey with N=2000 and z_max=1.7, we estimate that the expected peculiar velocity-induced errors in the best-fit cosmological constant density and equation of state can be sigma_Lambda~0.009 and sigma_w~0.01, respectively, which are subdominant to the errors due to the intrinsic scatter.

    "HWT": "Ferroelectrics display spontaneous and switchable electrical polarization. Until recently, ferroelectricity was believed to disappear at the nanoscale; now, nano-ferroelectrics are being considered in numerous applications. This renewed interest was partly fuelled by the observation of ferroelectric domains in films of a few unit cells thickness, promising further size reduction of ferroelectric devices. It turns out that at reduced scales and dimensionalities the material's properties depend crucially on the intricacies of domain formation, that is, the way the crystal splits into regions with polarization oriented along the different energetically equivalent directions, typically at 180o and 90o from each other. Here we present a step forward in the manipulation and control of ferroelectric domains by the growth of thin films with regular self-patterned arrays of 90o domains only 7 nm wide. This is the narrowest width for 90o domains in epitaxial ferroelectrics that preserves the film lateral coherence, independently of the substrate.",
    "MGT": "This study investigates the size and distribution of smallest 90° domains in epitaxial ferroelectric films, focusing on their role in the overall polarization behavior and stability. Utilizing advanced imaging techniques such as Piezoresponse Force Microscopy (PFM) and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), we systematically examine domain structures in a series of epitaxial Pb(Zr0.52Ti0.48)O3 (PZT) films. Our findings reveal that the formation of 90° domains is critically influenced by film thickness, strain conditions, and electrode configuration. Notably, the smallest domains were observed in films with thicknesses below 20 nm, where strain from the substrate plays a dominant role in domain stabilization. We propose a model linking domain size reduction to enhanced energy barriers for domain wall motion, which in turn contributes to improved fatigue resistance and cycling endurance in these films. Our results provide insights into the fundamental mechanisms governing domain configuration in ferroelectric materials and suggest pathways for optimizing functional properties in device applications. This work advances the understanding of domain dynamics in thin films and opens avenues for engineering domain structures at the nanoscale to enhance ferroelectric performance.",

A comparison is made to show their similarity and difference, especially with respect to the influence on hydrodynamic Lyapunov modes (HLMs). Our numerical simulations show that in both Hamiltonian and dissipative systems HLMs formerly detected via OLVs survive if CLVs are used instead. Moreover the previous classification of two universality classes works for CLVs as well, i.e. the dispersion relation is linear for Hamiltonian systems and quadratic for dissipative systems respectively. The significance of HLMs changes in different ways for Hamiltonian and dissipative systems with the replacement of OLVs by CLVs. For general dissipative systems with nonhyperbolic dynamics the long wave length structure in Lyapunov vectors corresponding to near-zero Lyapunov exponents is strongly reduced if CLVs are used instead, whereas for highly hyperbolic dissipative systems the significance of HLMs is nearly identical for CLVs and OLVs. In contrast the HLM significance of Hamiltonian systems is always comparable for CLVs and OLVs irrespective of hyperbolicity. We also find that in Hamiltonian systems different symmetry relations between conjugate pairs are observed for CLVs and OLVs. Especially, CLVs in a conjugate pair are statistically indistinguishable in consequence of the micro- reversibility of Hamiltonian systems.

An important step toward this goal is the demonstration that electronic structure can be controlled by atomic composition. In compounds with partially occupied transition-metal d shells, one important aspect of the electronic structure is the relative occupancy of different d orbitals. Previous work has established that strain and quantum confinement can be used to influence orbital occupancy. In this paper we demonstrate a different modality for orbital control in transition-metal oxide heterostructures, using density-functional band calculations supplemented by a tight-binding analysis to show that the choice of nontransition-metal counterion X in transition-metal oxide heterostructures composed of alternating LaNiO3 and LaXO3 units strongly affects orbital occupancy, changing the magnitude and in some cases the sign of the orbital polarization.",

The new formula is tested on the case of a strong coupling superconductor Pb$_{0.9}$Bi$_{0.1}$ and an excellent agreement with theoretical predictions is obtained.

    "HWT": "We present results from a detailed experimental investigation of LaFeAsO, the parent material in the series of \"FeAs\" based oxypnictide superconductors. Upon cooling this material undergoes a tetragonal-orthorhombic crystallographic phase transition at ~160 K followed closely by an antiferromagnetic ordering near 145 K. Analysis of these phase transitions using temperature dependent powder X-ray and neutron diffraction measurements is presented. A magnetic moment of ~0.35 Bohr magnetons per iron is derived from Mossbauer spectra in the low temperature phase. Evidence of the structural transition is observed at temperatures well above the structural transition (up to near 200 K) in the diffraction data as well as the polycrystalline elastic moduli probed by resonant ultrasound spectroscopy measurements. The effects of the two phase transitions on the transport properties (resistivity, thermal conductivity, Seebeck coefficient, Hall coefficient), heat capacity, and magnetization of LaFeAsO are also reported, including a dramatic increase in the magnitude of the Hall coefficient below 160 K. The results suggest that the structural distortion leads to a localization of carriers on Fe, producing small local magnetic moments which subsequently order antiferromagnetically upon further cooling. Evidence of strong electron-phonon interactions in the high-temperature tetragonal phase is also observed.",

We propose that the \\emph{other} QGP phase line, beginning at the triple point and rising towards the region of extremely high temperatures and chemical potentials, is described instead by a non-perturbative string effect discovered by Seiberg and Witten. Using an assumed position for the critical point, we are able to use this proposal to obtain a holographic lower bound on the temperature of the triple point.

Preserving the structure becomes more prohibitive due to the distributed and potentially uncooperative nature of such networks, as in the peer-to-peer (P2P) networks. Thus, most practical solutions involve unstructured approaches while attempting to maintain the structure at various levels of protocol stack. The primary focus of this paper is to investigate construction and maintenance of scale-free topologies in a distributed manner without requiring global topology information at the time when nodes join or leave. We consider the uncooperative behavior of peers by limiting the number of neighbors to a pre-defined hard cutoff value (i.e., no peer is a major hub), and the ad-hoc behavior of peers by rewiring the neighbors of nodes leaving the network. We also investigate the effect of these hard cutoffs and rewiring of ad-hoc nodes on the P2P search efficiency.",

    "MGT_raw": "This paper addresses the challenge of comparing and interpolating probability distributions situated on a manifold, a problem pertinent in various fields such as machine learning and computer vision. Traditional methods often fall short when dealing with the geometric complexities inherent to manifolds. We propose a novel framework that leverages the intrinsic geometry of the manifold by employing Riemannian metrics to define meaningful distances between distributions. Our approach introduces a metric-based interpolation technique that preserves the manifold's structure, ensuring smooth transitions between distributions. We present a comparative analysis with existing Euclidean-based methods, demonstrating superior performance in terms of both accuracy and computational efficiency. Empirical experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets, including image and shape analysis, validate our framework's effectiveness.

The dried deposits often exhibit complex structures exemplified by the coffee ring pattern, where most particles have accumulated at the periphery of the deposit. In this work, the formation of deposits during the drying of nanoliter colloidal drops on a flat substrate is investigated numerically and experimentally. A finite-element numerical model is developed that solves the Navier-Stokes, heat and mass transport equations in a Lagrangian framework. The diffusion of vapor in the atmosphere is solved numerically, providing an exact boundary condition for the evaporative flux at the droplet-air interface. Laplace stresses and thermal Marangoni stresses are accounted for. The particle concentration is tracked by solving a continuum advection-diffusion equation. Wetting line motion and the interaction of the free surface of the drop with the growing deposit are modeled based on criteria on wetting angles. Numerical results for evaporation times and flow field are in very good agreement with published experimental and theoretical results. We also performed transient visualization experiments of water and isopropanol drops loaded with polystyrene microsphere evaporating on respectively glass and polydimethylsiloxane substrates. Measured evaporation times, deposit shape and sizes, and flow fields are in very good agreement with the numerical results.

In many cases, the decay rate of classical small amplitude oscillons is known to be exponentially suppressed and so they are extremely long lived. In this work we compute the decay rate of quantized oscillons. We find it to be a power law in the amplitude and couplings of the theory. Therefore, the quantum decay rate is very different to the classical decay rate and is often dominant. We show that essentially all oscillons eventually decay by producing outgoing radiation. In single field theories the outgoing radiation has typically linear growth, while if the oscillon is coupled to other bosons the outgoing radiation can have exponential growth. The latter is a form of parametric resonance: explosive energy transfer from a localized clump into daughter fields. This may lead to interesting phenomenology in the early universe.

Results: The star V1247 Ori is interesting for the study of the UX Orionis phenomenon, in which Herbig Ae/Be stars are occulted by their protoplanetary discs, for three reasons: brightness (V ~ 9.85 mag), large infrared excess at 20-100 mum (F_60 ~ 10 Jy), and photometric stability out of occultation (sigma(V) ~ 0.02 mag), which may help to determine the location and spatial structure of the occulting disc clumps.",
    "MGT": "This study investigates the occultation events observed in the Herbig Ae/Be star V1247 Ori, a pre-main-sequence star exhibiting irregular variability. Using high-resolution photometric and spectroscopic data from ground-based observatories, we analyze these events to decipher the circumstellar environment's structure and dynamics. Our observations reveal periodic dimming episodes, suggesting a complex circumstellar disk with inhomogeneities or evolving structures such as clumps or spiral arms. The spectral analysis indicates the presence of gas and dust, with characteristics consistent with ongoing accretion processes. Variations in spectral lines during occultation events provide insights into the kinematics and composition of the intervening material. We propose that these occultations are likely caused by transient structures within the disk, possibly linked to planet formation or disk instability. Our results contribute to a deeper understanding of the circumstellar environments of Herbig Ae/Be stars and highlight the importance of multi-wavelength monitoring for uncovering the intricate processes governing early stellar evolution. Future observations with space-based telescopes are recommended to enhance the spatial resolution and further elucidate the nature of these occultation events.",

Such a dielectric response of ferroelectric/dielectric thin films has been theoretically addressed in this work. We propose that at the initial stage of the crystallization process in thin films, the transformation from amorphous to crystalline phase should increase substantially the dielectric loss; then, with further increase in the processing temperature, the coalescent growth of small crystalline grains into big ones could be helpful in reducing the dielectric loss by lowering grain boundary densities. The obtained experimental data for (Ba, Sr)TiO3 thin films with 500 nm in thickness were analyzed in terms of the model developed and shown to be in a reasonable agreement with the theoretical results.",

    "HWT": "For general memoryless systems, the typical information theoretic solution - when exists - has a \"single-letter\" form. This reflects the fact that optimum performance can be approached by a random code (or a random binning scheme), generated using independent and identically distributed copies of some single-letter distribution. Is that the form of the solution of any (information theoretic) problem? In fact, some counter examples are known. The most famous is the \"two help one\" problem: Korner and Marton showed that if we want to decode the modulo-two sum of two binary sources from their independent encodings, then linear coding is better than random coding. In this paper we provide another counter example, the \"doubly-dirty\" multiple access channel (MAC). Like the Korner-Marton problem, this is a multi-terminal scenario where side information is distributed among several terminals; each transmitter knows part of the channel interference but the receiver is not aware of any part of it. We give an explicit solution for the capacity region of a binary version of the doubly-dirty MAC, demonstrate how the capacity region can be approached using a linear coding scheme, and prove that the \"best known single-letter region\" is strictly contained in it. We also state a conjecture regarding a similar rate loss of single letter characterization in the Gaussian case.",

The spectrum emitted by this plasma contains diagnostics that have been used to determine the time since the disturbing event, although this determination becomes uncertain as the elements in the plasma return to ionization equilibrium. A general solution for the equilibrium timescale for each element arises from the elegant eigenvector method of solution to the problem of a non-equilibrium plasma described by Masai (1984) and Hughes & Helfand (1985). In general the ionization evolution of an element Z in a constant electron temperature plasma is given by a coupled set of Z+1 first order differential equations. However, they can be recast as Z uncoupled first order differential equations using an eigenvector basis for the system. The solution is then Z separate exponential functions, with the time constants given by the eigenvalues of the rate matrix. The smallest of these eigenvalues gives the scale of slowest return to equilibrium independent of the initial conditions, while conversely the largest eigenvalue is the scale of the fastest change in the ion population. These results hold for an ionizing plasma, a recombining plasma, or even a plasma with random initial conditions, and will allow users of these diagnostics to determine directly if their best-fit result significantly limits the timescale since a disturbance or is so close to equilibrium as to include an arbitrarily-long time.",

Our analysis reveals that the timescales are highly sensitive to these parameters, with higher electron densities and temperatures typically leading to shorter equilibrium timescales.

These growth patterns are manifested in all types of bacteria and yeasts. The ubiquity of these growth patterns suggests that they are driven by a universal mechanism common to all microbial species. In previous work, we showed that a minimal model accounting only for enzyme induction and dilution explains the phenotypes observed in batch cultures of various wild-type and mutant/recombinant cells. Here, we examine the extension of the minimal model to continuous cultures. We show that: (1) Several enzymatic trends, usually attributed to specific regulatory mechanisms such as catabolite repression, are completely accounted for by dilution. (2) The bifurcation diagram of the minimal model for continuous cultures, which classifies the substrate consumption pattern at any given dilution rate and feed concentrations, provides a a precise explanation for the empirically observed correlation between the growth patterns in batch and continuous cultures. (3) Numerical simulations of the model are in excellent agreement with the data. The model captures the variation of the steady state substrate concentrations, cell densities, and enzyme levels during the single- and mixed-substrate growth of bacteria and yeasts at various dilution rates and feed concentrations. (4) This variation is well-approximated by simple analytical expressions that furnish physical insights into the steady states of continuous cultures.

We show that the system belongs to the universality class of paramagnetic-ferromagnetic -helical systems. We vary the coupling constant of the theory, which is obtained from integrating out the gluonic degrees of freedom. In weak coupling, the FF phase is favored at arbitrary flavor asymmetries for sufficiently low temperatures; at intermediate coupling its occupancy domain is shifted towards larger asymmetries. Strong coupling features a new regime of an inhomogeneous FF state, which we identify with a current-carrying Bose-Einstein condensate of tightly bound up and down quarks. We analyze the occupation numbers and the Cooper-pair wave function and show that when the condensate momentum is orthogonal to the particle momentum the minority component contains a blocking region (breach) around the Fermi sphere in the weak-coupling limit, which engulfs more low-momentum modes as the coupling is increased, and eventually leads to a topological change in strong coupling, where the minority Fermi sphere contains either two occupied strips or an empty sphere. For non-orthogonal momenta, the blocking region is either reduced or extinct, i.e., no topological changes are observed.",

Here, we explore how these factors impact the pairing of quarks, especially in the context of FF pairing, where Cooper pairs have a non-zero total momentum. Utilizing advanced theoretical frameworks, including the Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model at weak coupling and the functional renormalization group approach at strong coupling, we map out the phase diagram and identify regions where FF pairing is favored. Our analysis reveals that FF pairing emerges as an energetically favorable state under conditions of mismatched Fermi surfaces, driven by external magnetic fields or charge chemical potential differences. This phase is found to be robust across both weak and strong coupling regimes, with distinct characteristics in each limit. In the weak coupling regime, the FF phase is stabilized by a delicate balance of magnetic catalysis effects and the Zeeman splitting of energy levels.

For a family of these models we find a direct thermal transition from the Coulomb phase to the dimer crystal. While some systems exhibit (strong) first-order transitions in correspondence with the Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson paradigm, we also find clear numerical evidence for continuous transitions.

The method uses two expansions for the Green function, valid in `quasilocal' and `distant past' regimes, which are matched within the normal neighbourhood. We perform our calculation in a static region of the spherically symmetric Nariai spacetime (dS_2 x S^2), on which scalar perturbations are governed by a radial equation with a P\\\"oschl-Teller potential. We combine (i) a very high order quasilocal expansion, and (ii) an expansion in quasinormal modes, to determine the Green function globally. We show it is singular everywhere on the null wavefront (even outside the normal neighbourhood), and apply asymptotic methods to determine its singular structure. We find the Green function undergoes a transition every time the null wavefront passes through a caustic: the singular part follows a repeating four-fold sequence $\\delta(\\sigma)$, $1/\\pi \\sigma$, $-\\delta(\\sigma)$, $-1/\\pi \\sigma$ etc., where $\\sigma$ is Synge's world function. The matched expansion method provides new insight into the non-local properties of the self-force; we find the contribution from the segment of the worldline lying outside the normal neighbourhood is significant. We compute the scalar self-force acting on a static particle, and validate against an alternative method. Finally, we discuss wave propagation on black hole spacetimes (where any expansion in quasinormal modes will be augmented by a branch cut integral) and predict that the Green function in Schwarzschild spacetime will inherit the four-fold singular structure found here.",

The experiment was carried out at the IKP of the University of Cologne in order to identify double octupole states and two-particle configurations in the 146Gd nucleus. The target was surrounded by a compact array of nine individual Ge detectors and one EUROBALL CLUSTER detector. A total of 44 new states have been identified, as well as new gamma rays corresponding to 26 previously known levels. Among these levels, new candidates for the two-particle configuration states have been found as well as for the (3- x 2+) and (3- x 3-) two phonon multiplets. A very important results of this work is the unequivocal assignment of the 6- member of the two phonon octupole state in 146Gd by identifying the E3 branching to the one phonon 3- state. This result presents the first conclusive observation of a 6+ to 3- to 0+ double E3 cascade in the decay of a two-phonon octupole state.",

    "HWT": "A spatially extended classical system with metastable states subject to weak spatiotemporal noise can exhibit a transition in its activation behavior when one or more external parameters are varied. Depending on the potential, the transition can be first or second-order, but there exists no systematic theory of the relation between the order of the transition and the shape of the potential barrier. In this paper, we address that question in detail for a general class of systems whose order parameter is describable by a classical field that can vary both in space and time, and whose zero-noise dynamics are governed by a smooth polynomial potential. We show that a quartic potential barrier can only have second-order transitions, confirming an earlier conjecture [1]. We then derive, through a combination of analytical and numerical arguments, both necessary conditions and sufficient conditions to have a first-order vs. a second-order transition in noise-induced activation behavior, for a large class of systems with smooth polynomial potentials of arbitrary order. We find in particular that the order of the transition is especially sensitive to the potential behavior near the top of the barrier.",

    "HWT": "The physical mechanisms responsible for production of the non-thermal emission in accreting black holes (BH) should be imprinted in the observational apperances of the power law tails in the X-ray spectra from these objects. Different spectral states exhibited by galactic BH binaries allow examination of the photon upscattering under different accretion regimes. We revisit the data collected by Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE) from the BH X-ray binary XTE J1550-564 during two periods of X-ray activity in 1998 and 2000 focusing on the behavior of the high energy cutoff of the power law part of the spectrum. For the 1998 outburst the transition from the low-hard state to the intermediate state was accompanied by a gradual decrease in the cutoff energy which then showed an abrupt reversal to a clear increasing trend as the source evolved to the very high and high-soft states. The 2000 outburst showed only the decreasing part of this pattern. Notably, the photon indexes corresponding to the cutoff increase for the 1998 event are much higher than the index values reached during the 2000 rise transition. We attribute this difference in the cutoff energy behavior to the different partial contributions of the thermal and non-thermal (bulk motion) Comptonization in photon upscattering. Namely, during the 1998 event the higher accretion rate presumably provided more cooling to the Comptonizing media and thus reducing the effectiveness of the thermal upscattering process. Under these conditions the bulk motion takes a leading role in boosting the input soft photons. Monte Carlo simulations of the Comptonization in a bulk motion region near an accreting black hole by Laurent & Titarchuk 2010 strongly support this scenario.",

    "HWT": "The classical method for deriving the macroscopic dynamics of a lattice Boltzmann system is to use a combination of different approximations and expansions. Usually a Chapman-Enskog analysis is performed, either on the continuous Boltzmann system, or its discrete velocity counterpart. Separately a discrete time approximation is introduced to the discrete velocity Boltzmann system, to achieve a practically useful approximation to the continuous system, for use in computation. Thereafter, with some additional arguments, the dynamics of the Chapman-Enskog expansion are linked to the discrete time system to produce the dynamics of the completely discrete scheme. In this paper we put forward a different route to the macroscopic dynamics. We begin with the system discrete in both velocity space and time. We hypothesize that the alternating steps of advection and relaxation, common to all lattice Boltzmann schemes, give rise to a slow invariant manifold. We perform a time step expansion of the discrete time dynamics using the invariance of the manifold. Finally we calculate the dynamics arising from this system. By choosing the fully discrete scheme as a starting point we avoid mixing approximations and arrive at a general form of the microscopic dynamics up to the second order in the time step. We calculate the macroscopic dynamics of two commonly used lattice schemes up to the first order, and hence find the precise form of the deviation from the Navier-Stokes equations in the dissipative term, arising from the discretization of velocity space. Finally we perform a short wave perturbation on the dynamics of these example systems, to find the necessary conditions for their stability.",

Phenomenological properties of the bulk and ridge behaviors are used as inputs to determine the elliptic flow of pion and proton at low p_T. At intermediate p_T the recombination of shower partons with thermal partons becomes more important. The phi dependence arises from the variation of the in-medium path length of the hard parton that generates the shower. The p_T dependence of v_2 is therefore very different at intermediate p_T compared to that at low p_T.

The Friedman equation in this model acquires an unconventional term due to the Lorentz-breaking condensates which has the equation of state w = -1 / (3 gamma) with gamma being a free parameter taking values outside of the range [0,1/3]. Apart from the standard contributions, the perturbations above the Friedmann background contain an extra piece which is proportional to an arbitrary function theta(x) of the space coordinates. This function appears as an integration constant and corresponds to a non-propagating scalar mode which may, however, become dynamical with the account of the higher-derivative corrections. For -1 < gamma < 0 and gamma = 1 the ``anomalous'' perturbations grow slower than the standard ones and thus the model is compatible with observations. Whether the model is experimentally acceptable at other values of \\gamma depends on the value of the function theta(x) at the beginning of the radiation-dominated epoch.",

Methods: Herschel far-infrared PACS and SPIRE observations are combined with existing data at longer and shorter wavelengths to characterize the spectral and physical evolution of massive star-forming regions. Results: The new Herschel images spectacularly show the evolution of the youngest and cold high-mass star-forming regions from mid-infrared shadows on the Wien-side of the spectral energy distribution (SED), via structures almost lost in the background emission around 100mum, to strong emission sources at the Rayleigh-Jeans tail. Fits of the SEDs for four exemplary regions covering evolutionary stages from high-mass starless cores to high-mass protostellar objects reveal that the youngest regions can be fitted by single-component black-bodies with temperatures on the order of 17K. More evolved regions show mid-infrared excess emission from an additional warmer component, which however barely contributes to the total luminosities for the youngest regions. Exceptionally low values of the ratio between bolometric and submm luminosity additionally support the youth of the infrared-dark sources. Conclusions: The Herschel observations reveal the spectral and physical properties of young high-mass star-forming regions in detail. The data clearly outline the evolutionary sequence in the images and SEDs.

We are particularly interested in whether the doping-induced transition between the two states is first order, or the two pure phases are separated by an intermediate phase with coexisting SC and SDW orders. For perfect nesting, the two orders do not coexist, because SDW order, which comes first, gaps the full Fermi surface leaving no space for SC to develop. When nesting is not perfect due to either ellipticity of electron bands or doping-induced difference in chemical potentials for holes and electrons, SDW order still leaves modified Fermi surfaces for not too strong SDW magnetism and the SC order may develop. We show that the two orders coexist only when certain relations between ellipticity and doping are met. In particular, in a compensated metal, ellipticity alone is not sufficient for coexistence of the two orders.",

John Nash proved more than 50 years ago that an equilibrium always exists such that nobody would benefit from unilaterally changing his strategy. Nash Equilibrium is a central concept in game theory, which offers a mathematical foundation for social science and economy. However, it is important from both a theoretical and a practical point of view to understand game playing where individuals are less selfish. This paper offers a constructive generalization of Nash equilibrium to study n-person games where the selfishness of individuals can be defined at any level, including the extreme of complete selfishness. The generalization is constructive since it offers a protocol for individuals in a society to reach an equilibrium. Most importantly, this paper presents experimental results and theoretical investigation to show that the individuals in a society can reduce their selfishness level together to reach a new equilibrium where they can have better payoffs and the society is more stable at the same time. This study suggests that, for the benefit of everyone in a society (including the financial market), the pursuit of maximal payoff by each individual should be controlled at some level either by voluntary good citizenship or by imposed regulations.",

Our research proposes a novel framework that extends the Nash equilibrium by incorporating a mechanism for cooperative strategy adjustments, thus promoting higher collective payoffs without sacrificing individual rationality.\n\nWe develop a mathematical model that integrates a dynamic adjustment process, allowing players to iteratively refine their strategies based on a shared objective of maximizing total payoff. This model employs a convergence algorithm that guides players towards a generalized equilibrium state, characterized by improved stability and efficiency. The proposed equilibrium concept is termed the \"Cooperative Nash Equilibrium\" (CNE), which ensures that any deviation by individual players does not lead to a decrease in the collective payoff, thereby resolving common inefficiencies associated with traditional equilibria.\n\nThrough rigorous theoretical analysis and simulation experiments, we demonstrate that the CNE consistently outperforms the traditional Nash equilibrium in terms of both individual and collective payoffs. The simulations, conducted across various game structures, reveal that the CNE achieves higher levels of stability and cooperation, particularly in multi-agent environments.

The prompt spectrum was best fit by a combination of a blackbody and a power--law model (the quasithermal model), with evidence for high energy emission continuing above 8 MeV. A pseudo-redshift value of pz = 0.95 +/- 0.18 was determined using the spectral fit parameters. The isotropic energy at this pseudo-redshift is 8.5 x 10^{52} erg.

The model is derived by treating the nonlinearity in the perturbation equation (involving the Reynolds stress) as an unknown forcing, yielding a linear relationship between the velocity field response and this nonlinearity. We do not assume small perturbations. We examine propagating modes, permitting comparison of our results to experimental data, and identify the steady component of the velocity field that varies only in the wall-normal direction as the turbulent mean profile. The \"optimal\" forcing shape, that gives the largest velocity response, is assumed to lead to modes that will be dominant and hence observed in turbulent pipe flow. An investigation of the most amplified velocity response at a given wavenumber-frequency combination reveals critical layer-like behaviour reminiscent of the neutrally stable solutions of the Orr-Sommerfeld equation in linearly unstable flow. Two distinct regions in the flow where the influence of viscosity becomes important can be identified, namely a wall layer that scales with $R^{+1/2}$ and a critical layer, where the propagation velocity is equal to the local mean velocity, that scales with $R^{+2/3}$ in pipe flow. This framework appears to be consistent with several scaling results in wall turbulence and reveals a mechanism by which the effects of viscosity can extend well beyond the immediate vicinity of the wall.",

The vast amounts of data are usually represented in the form of matrices and can be considered as knowledge networks. Spectra-based approaches have proved useful in extracting hidden information within such networks and for estimating missing data, but these methods are based essentially on linear assumptions. The physical models of matching, when applicable, often suggest non-linear mechanisms, that may sometimes be identified as noise. The use of non-linear models in data analysis, however, may require the introduction of many parameters, which lowers the statistical weight of the model.

    "HWT": "With the explicit breaking of scale invariance by the trace anomaly of QCD rephrased in terms of spontaneous breaking, low-energy strong interaction dynamics of dense (and also hot) matter can be effectively captured by -- in addition to the Nambu-Goldstone bosons and the vector mesons -- two dilaton fields, the \"soft\" ($\\chi_s$) field that is locked to chiral symmetry and the \"hard\" ($\\chi_h$) field which remains unaffected by chiral symmetry. The interplay of the soft and hard dilatons plays a subtle role in how chiral symmetry is manifested in hot and/or dense matter. The scale anomaly in which the soft component intervenes vanishes at the chiral transition in a way analogous to the restoration of scale symmetry in the Freund-Nambu model, while that of the hard component remains broken throughout the QCD sector. Most remarkable of all is its role in the chiral anomaly sector through a \"homogeneous Wess-Zumino (hWZ) term\" of the form $\\omega_\\mu B^\\mu$ on the structure of a single baryon as well as dense baryonic matter. It figures crucially in predicting a \"Little Bag\" for the nucleon and a \"quarkyonic phase\" in the form of a half-skyrmion matter at high density. We show how the vanishing of the vector-meson mass at the vector manifestation fixed point in hidden local symmetry theory can be related to the property of the \"matter field\" in the Freund-Nambu model that leaves scale symmetry invariant. The emerging structure of dense hadronic matter in the model so constructed suggests what could be amiss in describing dense matter in holographic dual QCD at its large $N_c$ and 't Hooft limit.",

    "HWT": "We have produced brightness and magnetic field maps of the surfaces of CV Cha and CR Cha: two actively accreting G and K-type T Tauri stars in the Chamaeleon I star-forming cloud with ages of 3-5 Myr. Our magnetic field maps show evidence for strong, complex multi-polar fields similar to those obtained for young rapidly rotating main sequence stars. Brightness maps indicate the presence of dark polar caps and low latitude spots -- these brightness maps are very similar to those obtained for other pre-main sequence and rapidly rotating main sequence stars. Only two other classical T Tauri stars have been studied using similar techniques so far: V2129 Oph and BP Tau. CV Cha and CR Cha show magnetic field patterns that are significantly more complex than those recovered for BP Tau, a fully convective T Tauri star. We discuss possible reasons for this difference and suggest that the complexity of the stellar magnetic field is related to the convection zone; with more complex fields being found in T Tauri stars with radiative cores (V2129 Oph, CV Cha and CR Cha). However, it is clearly necessary to conduct magnetic field studies of T Tauri star systems, exploring a wide range of stellar parameters in order to establish how they affect magnetic field generation, and thus how these magnetic fields are likely to affect the evolution of T Tauri star systems as they approach the main sequence.",

The detailed analysis of their Stokes V profiles, obtained with the ESPaDOnS spectropolarimeter, allows for the reconstruction of the stellar magnetic topologies through Zeeman-Doppler Imaging (ZDI).

The magnetic field topology of CV Cha is predominantly poloidal with a significant toroidal component, while CR Cha exhibits a more mixed poloidal-toroidal structure. The differential rotation rates inferred from our data suggest that both stars exhibit moderate to rapid rotation, with CV Cha having a faster equator-pole differential rotation compared to CR Cha.

They evolve in homogeneous electric fields or emerge from needle electrodes with voltages of 10 to 20 kV. The streamer velocity at given streamer length depends only weakly on the initial ionization seed, except in the case of negative streamers in homogeneous fields. We characterize the streamers by length, head radius, head charge and field enhancement. We show that the velocity of positive streamers is mainly determined by their radius and in quantitative agreement with recent experimental results both for radius and velocity. The velocity of negative streamers is dominated by electron drift in the enhanced field; in the low local fields of the present simulations, it is little influenced by photo-ionization. Though negative streamer fronts always move at least with the electron drift velocity in the local field, this drift motion broadens the streamer head, decreases the field enhancement and ultimately leads to slower propagation or even extinction of the negative streamer.",

We focused on small-size systems that are relevant for real biological food webs and for which the fluctuations are playing an important role. We show, using Monte Carlo simulations, that such webs can be non-viable, leading to extinction of all species in small and/or weakly coupled systems. Estimations of the extinction times and survival chances are also given. We show that before the extinction the fraction of highly-connected species (\"omnivores\") is increasing. Viable food webs exhibit a pyramidal structure, where the density of occupied niches is higher at lower trophic levels, and moreover the occupations of adjacent levels are closely correlated. We also demonstrate that the distribution of the lengths of food chains has an exponential character and changes weakly with the parameters of the model. On the contrary, the distribution of avalanche sizes of the extinct species depends strongly on the connectedness of the web. For rather loosely connected systems we recover the power-law type of behavior with the same exponent as found in earlier studies, while for densely-connected webs the distribution is not of a power-law type.",

Consequently, for a MIMO-OFDMA system with $Q$ subcarriers, the proposed opportunistic scheduling and beamforming schemes require only one BFM index and $Q$ supportable throughputs to be returned from each MT to the BS, in contrast to $Q$ BFM indices and $Q$ supportable throughputs required by the conventional schemes.

We combine our emission line sample with earlier works forming the most comprehensive X-ray selected galaxy sample for the study of the X-ray luminosity to the Halpha luminosity - a well-calibrated star-formation indicator - relation.

YbRh2Si2 exhibits a weak antiferromagnetic transition at atmospheric pressure with a N\\'eel temperature of only T_N = 70 mK. By applying a small magnetic field T_N can be continuously suppressed to T=0 at B_c = 60 mT (B_|_c) driving the system to a quantum critical point (QCP). On applying external pressure the magnetic phase is stabilized and T_N(p) is increasing as usually observed in Yb-based heavy-fermion metals. Substituting Yb by La or Rh by Ir allows to create a negative chemical pressure, La (Ir) being smaller than Yb (Rh), and eventually to drive YbRh2Si2 to a pressure controlled QCP. In this paper we compare the effect of external hydrostatic pressure and chemical substitution on the ground-state properties of YbRh2Si2.",

X-ray diffraction and magnetization measurements reveal that chemical substitution induces lattice parameter changes and alters the magnetic ordering temperature, T_N, thus affecting the quantum critical point (QCP). Additionally, applying pressure systematically enhances the competition between magnetic order and Kondo screening, leading to a suppression of T_N and a shift in the QCP.

We argue that hot Jupiter atmospheres, with possibly fast (sonic) wind speeds, may require a more strongly coupled treatment, formally in the regime of radiation-hydrodynamics. To lowest order in v/c, relativistic Doppler shifts distort line profiles along optical paths with finite wind velocity gradients. This leads to flow-dependent deviations in the effective emission and absorption properties of the atmospheric medium. Evaluating the overall impact of these distortions on the radiative structure of a dynamic atmosphere is non-trivial. We present transmissivity and systematic equivalent width excess calculations which suggest possibly important consequences for radiation transport in hot Jupiter atmospheres. If winds are fast and bulk Doppler shifts are indeed important for the global radiative balance, accurate modeling and reliable data interpretation for hot Jupiter atmospheres may prove challenging: it would involve anisotropic and dynamic radiative transfer in a coupled radiation-hydrodynamical flow. On the bright side, it would also imply that the emergent properties of hot Jupiter atmospheres are more direct tracers of their atmospheric flows than is the case for Solar System planets. Radiation-hydrodynamics may also influence radiative transfer in other classes of hot exoplanetary atmospheres with fast winds.",

Our models incorporate multi-wavelength radiative transfer calculations and account for various opacity sources, including molecules such as H2O, TiO, and VO, and their effects on thermal circulation patterns. The simulations reveal that intense stellar irradiation induces significant day-night temperature contrasts, driving strong zonal winds and meridional circulation.

The turbulent to mean field strength ratio is found to be close to constant over the sampled observing range, with a hint of a decrease toward smaller scales, indicating that the role of magnetic field and turbulence is evolving with physical scale.

    "HWT": "(Abridged) Precision cosmology with Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) makes use of the fact that SN Ia luminosities depend on their light-curve shapes and colours. Using Supernova Legacy Survey (SNLS) and other data, we show that there is an additional dependence on the global characteristics of their host galaxies: events of the same light-curve shape and colour are, on average, 0.08mag (~4.0sigma) brighter in massive host galaxies (presumably metal-rich) and galaxies with low specific star-formation rates (sSFR). SNe Ia in galaxies with a low sSFR also have a smaller slope (\"beta\") between their luminosities and colours with ~2.7sigma significance, and a smaller scatter on SN Ia Hubble diagrams (at 95% confidence), though the significance of these effects is dependent on the reddest SNe. SN Ia colours are similar between low-mass and high-mass hosts, leading us to interpret their luminosity differences as an intrinsic property of the SNe and not of some external factor such as dust. If the host stellar mass is interpreted as a metallicity indicator, the luminosity trends are in qualitative agreement with theoretical predictions. We show that the average stellar mass, and therefore the average metallicity, of our SN Ia host galaxies decreases with redshift. The SN Ia luminosity differences consequently introduce a systematic error in cosmological analyses, comparable to the current statistical uncertainties on parameters such as w. We show that the use of two SN Ia absolute magnitudes, one for events in high-mass (metal-rich) galaxies, and one for events in low-mass (metal-poor) galaxies, adequately corrects for the differences. Cosmological fits incorporating these terms give a significant reduction in chi^2 (3.8-4.5sigma).

We analysed fulldisk images obtained with the PSPT, by using three interference filters that sample the Ca II K line with different bandpasses. We studied the dependence of the radiative emission of disk features on the filter bandpass. We also performed a NLTE spectral synthesis of the Ca II K line integrated over the bandpass of PSPT filters. The synthesis was carried out by utilizing both the PRD and CRD with the most recent set of semi empirical atmosphere models in the literature and some earlier atmosphere models. We measured the CLV of intensity values for various solar features identified on PSPT images and compared the results obtained with those derived from the synthesis. We find that CRD calculations derived using the most recent quiet Sun model, on average, reproduce the measured values of the quiet Sun regions slightly more accurately than PRD computations with the same model. This may reflect that the utilized atmospheric model was computed assuming CRD. Calculations with PRD on earlier quiet Sun model atmospheres reproduce measured quantities with a similar accuracy as to that achieved here by applying CRD to the recent model. We also find that the median contrast values measured for most of the identified bright features, disk positions, and filter widths are, on average, a factor 1.9 lower than those derived from PRD simulations performed using the recent bright feature models.

These putative tori have been studied with long-baseline infrared (IR) interferometry, but the spatial scales probed are different for different objects. They are at various distances and also have different physical sizes which apparently scale with the luminosity of the central engine. Here we look at interferometric visibilities as a function of spatial scales normalized by the size of the inner torus radius R_in. This approximately eliminates luminosity and distance dependence and, thus, provides a way to uniformly view the visibilities observed for various objects and at different wavelengths. We can construct a composite visibility curve over a large range of spatial scales if different tori share a common radial structure. The currently available observations do suggest model-independently a common radial surface brightness distribution in the mid-IR that is roughly of a power-law form r^-2 as a function of radius r, and extends to ~100 times R_in. Taking into account the temperature decrease toward outer radii with a simple torus model, this corresponds to the radial surface density distribution of dusty material directly illuminated by the central engine roughly in the range between r^0 and r^-1.

    "HWT": "Globular clusters are useful to test the validity of Newtonian dynamics in the low acceleration regime typical of galaxies, without the complications of non-baryonic dark matter. Specifically, in absence of disturbing effects, e.g. tidal heating, their velocity dispersion is expected to vanish at large radii. If such behaviour is not observed, and in particular if, as observed in elliptical galaxies, the dispersion is found constant at large radii below a certain threshold acceleration, this might indicate a break down of Newtonian dynamics. To minimise the effects of tidal heating in this paper we study the velocity dispersion profile of two distant globular clusters, NGC 1851 and NGC 1904. The velocity dispersion profile is derived from accurate radial velocities measurements, obtained at the ESO 8m VLT telescope. Reliable data for 184 and 146 bona fide cluster star members, respectively for NGC 1851 and NGC 1904, were obtained. These data allow to trace the velocity dispersion profile up to ~2r0, where r0 is the radius at which the cluster internal acceleration of gravity is a0 = 10e-8 cm/s/s. It is found that in both clusters the velocity dispersion becomes constant beyond ~r0. These new results are fully in agreement with those found for other five globular clusters previously investigated as part of this project. Taken all together, these 7 clusters support the claim that the velocity dispersion is constant beyond r0, irrespectively of the specific physical properties of the clusters: mass, size, dynamical history, and distance from the Milky Way. The strong similarly with the constant velocity dispersion observed in elliptical galaxies beyond r0 is suggestive of a common origin for this phenomenon in the two class of objects, and might indicate a breakdown of Newtonian dynamics below a0.",

Utilizing high-resolution spectroscopic data from the Very Large Telescope (VLT) and Gaia astrometric measurements, we construct detailed kinematic models of these clusters.

Surprisingly, both NGC 1851 and NGC 1904 exhibit M/L ratios consistent with stellar population predictions, posing challenges to the dark matter paradigm. We also explore the possibility of modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND) as an alternative explanation for the observed dynamics without invoking dark matter.

    "HWT": "In this paper we give a simple proof of the fact that the average over all dyadic lattices of the dyadic $H^1$-norm of a function gives an equivalent $H^1$-norm. The proof we present works for both one-parameter and multi-parameter Hardy spaces. The results of such type are known. The first result (for one-parameter Hardy spces) belongs to Burgess Davis (1980). Also, by duality, such results are equivalent to the \"BMO from dyadic BMO\" statements proved by Garnett-Jones(1982} for one parameter case, and by Pipher-Ward (2008) for two-parameter case. While the paper generalizes these results to the multi-parameter setting, this is not its main goal. The purpose of the paper is to present an approach leading to a simple proof, which works in both one-parameter and multi-parameter cases. The main idea of treating square function as a Calderon--Zygmind operator is a commonplace in harmonic analysis; the main observation, on which the paper is based, is that one can treat the random dyadic square function this way. After that, all is proved by using the standard and well-known results about Calderon--Zygmind operators in the Hilbert-space-valued setting. As an added bonus, we get a simple proof of the (equivalent by duality) inclusion $\\text{BMO}\\subset \\text{BMO}_d$, $H^1_d \\subset H^1$ in the multi-parameter case. Note, that unlike the one-parameter case, the inclusions in the general situation are far from trivial.",

Contention resolution approaches are always reactive and attempt to minimize the BLR based on local information available at the core node. On the other hand, a proactive approach that avoids burst losses before they occur is desirable. To reduce the probability of burst contention, a more robust routing algorithm than the shortest path is needed. This paper proposes a new routing mechanism for JET-based OBS networks, called Graphical Probabilistic Routing Model (GPRM) that selects less utilized links, on a hop-by-hop basis by using a bayesian network. We assume no wavelength conversion and no buffering to be available at the core nodes of the OBS network. We simulate the proposed approach under dynamic load to demonstrate that it reduces the Burst Loss Ratio (BLR) compared to static approaches by using Network Simulator 2 (ns-2) on NSFnet network topology and with realistic traffic matrix. Simulation results clearly show that the proposed approach outperforms static approaches in terms of BLR.",

We investigate how interactions between excitons and cavity photons lead to non-classical light emission, characterized by photon antibunching. Utilizing a quantum optics framework, we analyze the role of off-resonant coupling in modifying the exciton-cavity interaction, influencing the system's quantum statistical properties. Our theoretical model incorporates multiple exciton states, revealing how these states contribute to the observed antibunching effect. We demonstrate that the interplay between on-resonant and off-resonant interactions results in unique spectral features, which are experimentally verified through photoluminescence measurements.

    "HWT": "We report on a study that finds a positive correlation between black hole mass and variability amplitude in quasars. Roughly 100 quasars at z<0.75 were selected by matching objects from the QUEST1 Variability Survey with broad-lined objects from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. Black hole masses were estimated with the virial method using the broad Hbeta line, and variability was characterized from the QUEST1 light curves. The correlation between black hole mass and variability amplitude is significant at the 99% level or better and does not appear to be caused by obvious selection effects inherent to flux-limited samples. It is most evident for rest frame time lags of the order a few months up to the QUEST1 maximum temporal resolution of about 2 years. The correlation between black hole mass and variability amplitude means that the more massive black holes have larger percentage flux variations. Over 2-3 orders of magnitude in black hole mass, the amplitude increases by approximately 0.2 mag. A likely explanation for the correlation is that the more massive black holes are starving and produce larger flux variations because they do not have a steady inflow of gaseous fuel. Assuming that the variability arises from changes in the accretion rate Li & Cao [8] show that flux variations similar to those observed are expected as a consequence of the more massive black holes having cooler accretion disks.",

Our findings reveal a clear correlation between black hole mass and the characteristic timescales of variability, with more massive black holes exhibiting longer variability timescales. This trend is interpreted as a consequence of the larger emission regions associated with more massive black holes, as predicted by standard accretion disk theory. Additionally, we explore the role of accretion rates and their potential impact on variability characteristics, finding that accretion efficiency significantly modulates the observed variability. Our analysis also highlights the presence of a 'hysteresis' effect, where the variability pattern depends not only on the current state of the quasar but also on its past activity. This suggests complex feedback mechanisms between the central black hole and its surrounding environment.

The DQMC method allows us to test the validity of the use of a momentum independent self-energy which has been a central approximation in previous OSMT studies. In addition, we show that long range antiferromagnetic order (LRAFO) is established in the insulating phase, similar to the single band, square lattice Hubbard Hamiltonian.

    "HWT": "Nuclear spins are promising candidates for quantum information processing because their good isolation from the environment precludes the rapid loss of quantum coherence. Many strategies have been developed to further extend their decoherence times. Some of them make use of decoupling techniques based on the Carr-Purcell and Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill pulse sequences. In many cases, when applied to inhomogeneous samples, they yield a magnetization decay much slower than the Hahn echo. However, we have proved that these decays cannot be associated with longer decoherence times as coherences remain frozen. They result from coherences recovered after their storage as local polarization and thus they can be used as memories. We show here how this freezing of the coherent state, which can subsequently be recovered after times longer than the natural decoherence time of the system, can be generated in a controlled way with the use of field gradients. A similar behaviour of homogeneous samples in inhomogeneous fields are demonstrated. It is emphasized that the effects of inhomogeneities in solid state NMR, independently of their origin, should not be disregarded as they play a crucial role in multipulse sequences.",

We prove the existence of global continua of classical solutions that are periodic and traveling. This is accomplished by first constructing a 1-parameter family of laminar flow solutions, $\\mathcal{T}$, then applying bifurcation theory methods to obtain local curves of small amplitude solutions branching from $\\mathcal{T}$ at an eigenvalue of the linearized problem.

    "HWT": "The origin of massive field stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) has long been an enigma. The recent measurements of large offsets (~100 km/s) between the heliocentric radial velocities of some very massive (O2-type) field stars and the systemic LMC velocity provides a possible explanation of this enigma and suggests that the field stars are runaway stars ejected from their birth places at the very beginning of their parent cluster's dynamical evolution. A straightforward way to prove this explanation is to measure the proper motions of the field stars and to show that they are moving away from one of the nearby star clusters or OB associations. This approach however is complicated by the large distance to the LMC, which makes accurate proper motion measurements difficult. We use an alternative approach for solving the problem, based on the search for bow shocks produced by runaway stars. The geometry of detected bow shocks would allow us to infer the direction of stellar motion and thereby to determine their possible parent clusters. In this paper we present the results of a search for bow shocks around six massive field stars which were suggested in the literature as candidate runaway stars. Using archival (Spitzer Space Telescope) data, we found a bow shock associated with one of our program stars, the O2 V((f*)) star BI 237, which is the first-ever detection of bow shocks in the LMC. Orientation of the bow shock suggests that BI 237 was ejected from the OB association LH 82 (located at ~120 pc in projection from the star). A by-product of our search is the detection of bow shocks generated by four OB stars in the field of the LMC and an arc-like structure attached to the candidate luminous blue variable R81 (HD 269128). The geometry of two of these bow shocks is consistent with the possibility that their associated stars were ejected from the 30 Doradus star forming complex.",

Following previous work using total group luminosity as the mass indicator, here we split our groups by multiplicity and by estimated virial (group halo) mass, and consider red (passive) and blue (star forming) galaxies separately. In addition we utilise two different group catalogues (2PIGG and Yang et al. ) in order to ascertain the impact of the specific grouping algorithm and further investigate the environmental effects via variations in the LF with position in groups. Our main results are that LFs show a steepening faint end for early type galaxies as a function of group mass/ multiplicity, with a much suppressed trend (evident only in high mass groups) for late type galaxies. Variations between LFs as a function of group mass are robust irrespective of which grouping catalogue is used, and broadly speaking what method for determining group `mass' is used. We find in particular that there is a significant deficit of low-mass passive galaxies in low multiplicity groups, as seen in high redshift clusters. Further to this, the variation in the LF appears to only occur in the central regions of systems, and in fact seems to be most strongly dependent on the position in the group relative to the virial radius. Finally, distance-rank magnitude relations were considered. Only the Yang groups demonstrated any evidence of a correlation between a galaxy's position relative to the brightest group member and its luminosity. 2PIGG possessed no such gradient, the conclusion being the FOF algorithm suppresses the signal for weak luminosity--position trends and the Yang grouping algorithm naturally enhances it.",

Our analysis reveals that the shape of the GLF varies systematically with group characteristics. In particular, we observe that more massive groups tend to exhibit a steeper faint-end slope and a higher normalization in the GLF compared to lower mass groups. This suggests that massive groups are more efficient at hosting a multitude of low-luminosity galaxies, possibly due to enhanced processes such as galaxy merging and tidal interactions.\n\nFurthermore, we find that the bright-end of the GLF is also affected by group properties, with a noticeable shift towards higher luminosities in denser environments.

    "MGT_raw": "The study of galaxy formation and evolution is significantly advanced by understanding the distribution of galaxy luminosities within different environments. This paper investigates the variation of the galaxy luminosity function (GLF) with group properties, focusing on how environmental factors influence galaxy evolution. By analyzing a comprehensive sample of galaxy groups across a range of masses and densities, we explore the dependence of the GLF on group-centric parameters such as velocity dispersion, richness, and local density.\n\nUsing data from a large spectroscopic survey, we construct GLFs for different sub-samples of galaxy groups, categorized by these properties. Our analysis reveals that the shape of the GLF varies systematically with group characteristics. In particular, we observe that more massive groups tend to exhibit a steeper faint-end slope and a higher normalization in the GLF compared to lower mass groups. This suggests that massive groups are more efficient at hosting a multitude of low-luminosity galaxies, possibly due to enhanced processes such as galaxy merging and tidal interactions.\n\nFurthermore, we find that the bright-end of the GLF is also affected by group properties, with a noticeable shift towards higher luminosities in denser environments.

    "HWT": "Two gapped quantum ground states in the same phase are connected by an adiabatic evolution which gives rise to a local unitary transformation that maps between the states. On the other hand, gapped ground states remain within the same phase under local unitary transformations. Therefore, local unitary transformations define an equivalence relation and the equivalence classes are the universality classes that define the different phases for gapped quantum systems. Since local unitary transformations can remove local entanglement, the above equivalence/universality classes correspond to pattern of long range entanglement, which is the essence of topological order. The local unitary transformation also allows us to define a wave function renormalization scheme, under which a wave function can flow to a simpler one within the same equivalence/universality class. Using such a setup, we find conditions on the possible fixed-point wave functions where the local unitary transformations have \\emph{finite} dimensions. The solutions of the conditions allow us to classify this type of topological orders, which generalize the string-net classification of topological orders. We also describe an algorithm of wave function renormalization induced by local unitary transformations. The algorithm allows us to calculate the flow of tensor-product wave functions which are not at the fixed points. This will allow us to calculate topological orders as well as symmetry breaking orders in a generic tensor-product state.",

    "prompt": "On the Stability of Elliptical Vortices in Accretion Discs",
    "HWT": "(Abriged) The existence of large-scale and long-lived 2D vortices in accretion discs has been debated for more than a decade. They appear spontaneously in several 2D disc simulations and they are known to accelerate planetesimal formation through a dust trapping process. However, the issue of the stability of these structures to the imposition of 3D disturbances is still not fully understood, and it casts doubts on their long term survival. Aim: We present new results on the 3D stability of elliptical vortices embedded in accretion discs, based on a linear analysis and several non-linear simulations. Methods: We derive the linearised equations governing the 3D perturbations in the core of an elliptical vortex, and we show that they can be reduced to a Floquet problem. We solve this problem numerically in the astrophysical regime and we present several analytical limits for which the mechanism responsible for the instability can be explained. Finally, we compare the results of the linear analysis to some high resolution simulations. Results: We show that most anticyclonic vortices are unstable due to a resonance between the turnover time and the local epicyclic oscillation period. In addition, we demonstrate that a strong vertical stratification does not create any additional stable domain of aspect ratio, but it significantly reduces growth rates for relatively weak (and therefore elongated) vortices. Conclusions: Elliptical vortices are always unstable, whatever the horizontal or vertical aspect-ratio is. The instability can however be weak and is often found at small scales, making it difficult to detect in low-order finite-difference simulations.",

This study investigates the dynamical stability of elliptical vortices embedded in a differentially rotating, viscous disc.

Our analysis reveals that elliptical vortices exhibit increased stability relative to circular vortices, with the degree of stability being modulated by their aspect ratio and the Reynolds number of the disc. We find that low-viscosity environments and strong ellipticity favor vortex persistence, whereas high viscosity leads to rapid decay due to increased viscous dissipation. Additionally, we observe that external forcing, such as spiral density waves, plays a critical role in sustaining vortex structures by injecting angular momentum and energy. The simulations demonstrate that under certain conditions, elliptical vortices can survive for extended periods, significantly influencing the local accretion dynamics and potentially contributing to the formation of planetesimals or other astrophysical phenomena.

Our approach systematically incorporates mass-dependent corrections, leading to improved agreement with experimental observations and enhanced precision in extracting fundamental QCD parameters. The results demonstrate the significance of heavy quark masses in PQCD, offering a more accurate description of hadronic processes.

    "HWT": "The minimum feature size of a crossing-free straight line drawing is the minimum distance between a vertex and a non-incident edge. This quantity measures the resolution needed to display a figure or the tool size needed to mill the figure. The spread is the ratio of the diameter to the minimum feature size. While many algorithms (particularly in meshing) depend on the spread of the input, none explicitly consider finding a mesh whose spread is similar to the input. When a polygon is partitioned into smaller regions, such as triangles or quadrangles, the degradation is the ratio of original to final spread (the final spread is always greater). Here we present an algorithm to quadrangulate a simple n-gon, while achieving constant degradation. Note that although all faces have a quadrangular shape, the number of edges bounding each face may be larger. This method uses Theta(n) Steiner points and produces Theta(n) quadrangles. In fact to obtain constant degradation, Omega(n) Steiner points are required by any algorithm. We also show that, for some polygons, a constant factor cannot be achieved by any triangulation, even with an unbounded number of Steiner points. The specific lower bounds depend on whether Steiner vertices are used or not.",

However, studies of BCGs in optically-selected clusters show that star formation is not enhanced when compared to control samples of non-BCGs of similar stellar mass. Here we analyze a sample of 113 BCGs in low redshift (z<0.1), optically-selected clusters, a matched control sample of non-BCGs, and a smaller sample of BCGs in X-ray selected clusters. We convolve the SDSS images of the BCGs to match the resolution of the GALEX data and we measure UV-optical colours in their inner and outer regions. We find that optically-selected BCGs exhibit smaller scatter in optical colours and redder inner NUV-r colours than the control galaxies, indicating that they are a homogenous population with very little ongoing star formation. The BCGs in the X-ray selected cluster sample span a similar range in optical colours, but have bluer NUV-r colours. Among X-ray selected BCGs, those located in clusters with central cooling times of less than 1 Gyr are significantly bluer than those located in clusters where the central gas cooling times are long. Our main conclusion is that the location of a galaxy at the centre of its halo is not sufficient to determine whether or not it is currently forming stars.

    "HWT": "Context: IRAS 04166+2706 in Taurus is one of the most nearby young stellar objects whose molecular outflow contains a highly collimated fast component. Methods: We have observed the IRAS 04166+2706 outflow with the IRAM Plateau de Bure interferometer in CO(J=2-1) and SiO(J=2-1) achieving angular resolutions between 2'' and 4''. To improve the quality of the CO(2-1) images, we have added single dish data to the interferometer visibilities. Results: The outflow consists of two distinct components. At velocities <10 km/s, the gas forms two opposed, approximately conical shells that have the YSO at their vertex. These shells coincide with the walls of evacuated cavities and seem to result from the acceleration of the ambient gas by a wide-angle wind. At velocities >30 km/s, the gas forms two opposed jets that travel along the center of the cavities and whose emission is dominated by a symmetric collection of at least 7 pairs of peaks. The velocity field of this component presents a sawtooth pattern with the gas in the tail of each peak moving faster than the gas in the head. This pattern, together with a systematic widening of the peaks with distance to the central source, is consistent with the emission arising from internal working surfaces traveling along the jet and resulting from variations in the velocity field of ejection. We interpret this component as the true protostellar wind, and we find its composition consistent with a chemical model of such type of wind. Conclusions: Our results support outflow wind models that have simultaneously wide-angle and narrow components, and suggest that the EHV peaks seen in a number of outflows consist of internally-shocked wind material.",

These evolve in discrete time steps according to a local, shift-invariant unitary evolution. By local we mean that no instantaneous long-range communication can occur. In order to define these over a Hilbert space we must restrict to a base of finite, yet unbounded configurations. We show that QCA always admit a two-layered block representation, and hence the inverse QCA is again a QCA. This is a striking result since the property does not hold for classical one-dimensional cellular automata as defined over such finite configurations. As an example we discuss a bijective cellular automata which becomes non-local as a QCA, in a rare case of reversible computation which does not admit a straightforward quantization. We argue that a whole class of bijective cellular automata should no longer be considered to be reversible in a physical sense.

Based on an energetic argument we predict a general intrinsic instability of an axially symmetric magnetic condensate towards a violation of this symmetry, which leads to the spontaneous formation of an anisotropy gap in the energy spectrum above the critical field. We, therefore, expect that a true Goldstone mode in insulating spin systems, i.e., a strictly linear energy-dispersion relation down to arbitrarily small excitations energies, cannot be observed in any real material.",
    "MGT": "This study investigates the phenomena of U(1) symmetry breaking and axial symmetry violation in TlCuCl3 and related insulating spin systems. Employing a combination of neutron scattering and magnetization measurements, we analyze the low-temperature phase transitions and magnetic properties of these materials. Our findings reveal that TlCuCl3 exhibits a quantum disordered phase characterized by a broken U(1) symmetry, leading to the emergence of a spin-liquid state with fractionalized excitations. The axial symmetry violation is attributed to spin-orbit coupling effects, which play a crucial role in determining the ground state properties. Comparative studies with other analogous systems highlight the universality and variability of these symmetry-breaking phenomena. Theoretical models, including spin-1/2 Heisenberg antiferromagnets on a triangular lattice with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions, are used to interpret experimental observations and predict new quantum phases. This research provides significant insights into the interplay between symmetry, topology, and magnetism in low-dimensional quantum magnets, paving the way for potential applications in quantum information technologies.",

    "prompt": "Identification of the Lithium Depletion Boundary and Age of the Southern Open Cluster Blanco 1",
    "HWT": "We present results from a spectroscopic study of the very low mass members of the Southern open cluster Blanco 1 using the Gemini-N telescope. We obtained intermediate resolution (R~4400) GMOS spectra for 15 cluster candidate members with I~14-20 mag, and employed a series of membership criteria - proximity to the cluster's sequence in an I/I-Ks color-magnitude diagram (CMD), kinematics agreeing with the cluster systemic motion, magnetic activity as a youth indicator - to classify 10 of these objects as probable cluster members. For these objects, we searched for the presence of the Li I 6708 A feature to identify the lithium depletion boundary (LDB) in Blanco 1. The I/I-Ks CMD shows a clear mass segregation in the Li distribution along the cluster sequence; namely, all higher mass stars are found to be Li-poor, while lower mass stars are found to be Li-rich. The division between Li-poor and Li-rich (i.e., the LDB) in Blanco 1 is found at I=$18.78 \\pm 0.24$ and I-Ks=$3.05 \\pm 0.10$. Using current pre-main-sequence evolutionary models we determine an LDB age of $132 \\pm 24$ Myr. Comparing our derived LDB age to upper-main-sequence isochrone ages for Blanco 1, as well as for other open clusters with identified LDBs, we find good chronometric consistency when using stellar evolution models that incorporate a moderate degree of convective core overshoot.",
    "MGT": "The Southern open cluster Blanco 1 offers a unique opportunity to study stellar evolution and cluster dynamics due to its relatively young age and well-defined stellar population. This study focuses on identifying the lithium depletion boundary (LDB) in Blanco 1 to refine the cluster's age estimate. We collected high-resolution spectra from the Blanco 1 members using ESO's VLT/FLAMES instrument, concentrating on late-type pre-main-sequence stars. Spectral analysis was performed to measure lithium abundances, enabling the determination of the LDB. The LDB is identified as the point at which lithium is significantly depleted in the atmospheres of low-mass stars, serving as an age indicator due to lithium's sensitivity to temperature and evolutionary state.\n\nComplementary to the spectral data, we utilized precise photometric measurements from the Gaia DR3, combined with 2MASS and WISE surveys, to construct an accurate color-magnitude diagram (CMD) for Blanco 1. This CMD aids in refining the distance modulus and extinction parameters crucial for LDB placement. We employed Bayesian statistical methods to integrate the spectral and photometric data, allowing us to address uncertainties in both the observed lithium abundances and the cluster's distance.\n\nOur results place the LDB for Blanco 1 at an effective temperature of approximately 3250 K, corresponding to a stellar mass of around 0.08 solar masses. By comparing our findings with theoretical isochrones, we derive an age estimate for Blanco 1 of approximately 40 million years, with an uncertainty of 5 million years. This refined age measurement not only enhances our understanding of Blanco 1's evolutionary state but also contributes valuable data for calibrating stellar and galactic models that depend on precise age determinations. Our study underscores the LDB method's efficacy in establishing ages for young open clusters, offering insights into their formation and dynamical histories.",

    "HWT": "Secluded dark matter models, in which WIMPs annihilate first into metastable mediators, can present novel indirect detection signatures in the form of gamma rays and fluxes of charged particles arriving from directions correlated with the centers of large astrophysical bodies within the solar system, such as the Sun and larger planets. This naturally occurs if the mean free path of the mediator is in excess of the solar (or planetary) radius. We show that existing constraints from water Cerenkov detectors already provide a novel probe of the parameter space of these models, complementary to other sources, with significant scope for future improvement from high angular resolution gamma-ray telescopes such as Fermi-LAT. Fluxes of charged particles produced in mediator decays are also capable of contributing a significant solar system component to the spectrum of energetic electrons and positrons, a possibility which can be tested with the directional and timing information of PAMELA and Fermi.",
    "MGT": "Recent observations and theoretical models suggest that dark matter, a predominant yet enigmatic component of the universe, might be responsible for generating solar gamma rays through secluded interactions. This study explores a novel hypothesis where secluded dark matter particles decay or annihilate within the solar core, producing gamma rays that escape the Sun's dense atmosphere. We utilize data from satellite-based gamma-ray observatories to analyze spectral anomalies coinciding with solar activity cycles. Our research employs a combination of advanced computational simulations and astrophysical measurements to identify distinctive signatures indicative of secluded dark matter processes. By correlating these gamma-ray emissions with theoretical predictions, we aim to elucidate the properties and interactions of dark matter in the solar environment. The findings propose that secluded dark matter could significantly contribute to solar gamma-ray fluxes, offering a new perspective on dark matter's role in cosmic phenomena. This work not only advances understanding of dark matter's indirect detection but also provides insights into solar dynamics, potentially reshaping the paradigms of both particle physics and astrophysics.

    "HWT": "Null hypothesis significance tests and p values are widely used despite very strong arguments against their use in many contexts. Confidence intervals are often recommended as an alternative, but these do not achieve the objective of assessing the credibility of a hypothesis, and the distinction between confidence and probability is an unnecessary confusion. This paper proposes a more straightforward (probabilistic) definition of confidence, and suggests how the idea can be applied to whatever hypotheses are of interest to researchers. The relative merits of the different approaches are discussed using a series of illustrative examples: usually confidence based approaches seem more transparent and useful, but there are some contexts in which p values may be appropriate. I also suggest some methods for converting results from one format to another. (The attractiveness of the idea of confidence is demonstrated by the widespread persistence of the completely incorrect idea that p=5% is equivalent to 95% confidence in the alternative hypothesis. In this paper I show how p values can be used to derive meaningful confidence statements, and the assumptions underlying the derivation. ) Key words: Confidence interval, Confidence level, Hypothesis testing, Null hypothesis significance tests, P value, User friendliness.",

    "HWT": "A macrocell superposed by indoor deployed femtocells forms a geography-overlapped and spectrum-shared two tier network, which can efficiently improve coverage and enhance system capacity. It is important for reducing inter-tier co-channel interference that any femtocell user (FU) can select suitable access channel according to the path losses between itself and the macrocell users (MUs). Path loss should be estimated non-cooperatively since information exchange is difficult between macrocell and femtocells. In this paper, a novel method is proposed for FU to estimate the path loss between itself and any MU independently. According to the adaptive modulation and coding (AMC) mode information broadcasted by the macrocell base station (BS), FU first estimates the path loss between BS and a MU by using Maximum a Posteriori (MAP) method. The probability distribution function (PDF) and statistics of the transmission power of the MU is then derived. According to the sequence of received powers from the MU, FU estimates the path loss between itself and the MU by using minimum mean square error (MMSE) method. Simulation results show that the proposed method can efficiently estimate the path loss between any FU and any MU in all kinds of conditions.",

Unlike traditional cooperative techniques that rely on inter-cell coordination, our approach leverages distributed learning algorithms, enabling femtocells to independently estimate path loss parameters based on localized signal measurements. By utilizing a stochastic gradient descent framework, each femtocell iteratively refines its path loss model, minimizing the need for centralized data processing and reducing overhead. Simulation results demonstrate that our method achieves high accuracy in path loss estimation, with significant improvements over existing non-cooperative algorithms, even in environments with high user mobility and dynamic interference patterns. Furthermore, the proposed method exhibits robustness against varying deployment densities and heterogeneous propagation conditions, making it suitable for diverse indoor scenarios.
