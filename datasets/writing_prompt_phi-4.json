He found him cozy in his favorite blue onesie, peeking out from under a thick blanket on the bed.\n\nHe stood with both legs planted firmly on the boy's bed like a brick wall denying it's demise. A confident bear this teddy was, filled with nothing other than stuffing made of cotton and the will of a steadfast soldier. No matter how tall, heavy or scaly this monster was, he was ready to slay him with his bare paws.\n\nThe cotton that shaped his heart grew fonder of the boy as the nights went on.

He was making sure the dark corners were just that -- dark corners.\n\nLiam pointed to the dark corner Teddy missed when scanning the bedroom. Liam thinks it's because Lily, the white polar bear, was propped up in front of the darkest corner, rendering the corner invisible. Teddy's eyes couldn't pass the chance to look at her moonlit fur, picturing it's radiant glow lightening his brown physique to a golden tone.\n\nA flick of Liam's foot jolted Teddy back to where he stood: amidst no-mans land awaiting the beasts lurking in the shadows. To his surprise, not one monster came to test the mortar of Teddy's modest brick wall that night.

A single proton hit earth traveling at a smidge under the speed of light with the same force as a baseball thrown at about sixty miles an hour.\nWhy do I bring this up? Well because, near as we can tell, that's what happened this time, only a little bigger. One moment I'm out on the Zvezda Module inspecting a micrometeorite impact. The next moment, the Earth is on fire. I'm not being figurative either. The Earth was on. Fire.\nWhatever the hell it was must have come from perpendicular to our orbit and only missed the ISS by a few hundred miles or so because I was looking almost straight down into an ever expanding ring of fire when it hit.\nOne second you're looking down at the Saharan desert; the next, the entirety of Africa is exposed down to the mantle and you're looking at a literal sea of magma.\nWe did the math, there wasn't much left to do beside the math.

We had laughed at something horrible, and in that laughter, we found strength. We would face the plague not as victims, but as a community united, armed with the courage to fight against the inevitable."

I gave it a closer look, when my Geiger counter starter firing off at a dangerous rate. A man came up to me, don't remember his name, and offered me to blow it up for a heavy pay. I.... I took they pay. These people are not crazy, they are insane. I had to put them out of their misery. Especially that Moria girl. She was already started to have brain rot from the radiation. I planted the explosive, went to the Tower, and watched the fireworks from there. But... something was off. The two men with me started to LAUGH. Why were they laughing? Were they.... enjoying the slaughter? That was it.... no more innocent lives. It took only two bullets from Dad's ole pistol to put them both out, but it will take a lifetime to make up for what I had done.\n-The Lone Wanderer",

We’ve fought side by side, sharing both triumphs and losses, but today, I missed them more than ever. \n\nI reflected on the time spent with Linkle, my little sister.

The seemingly empty loft littered with wasted women passed out on the floor, black and white balloons, and the scent of some used up Toronto kush. The drug-fueled energy bounced from room to room carrying with it the sounds and smells of drunk sex and desperation. It was maddening. The music, the wails, the screams. Everything. Pure fucking bliss infected with shudders of emptiness and regret.\n\n\"I said get the fucking table out.\"\n\nThere were three of us there. Abel, I, and the other skinny bitch next to him. We were all sitting on the white, leather sofa in the main room. I slouched on the left end while Abel was away from me, the other girl leaning on him desperately clinging to his black leather jacket. What was her fucking name? Natalie or some shit. I don't even fucking care.\n\n\"Yeah, nigga we got it.\"\n\nTwo other guys came into the room carrying the glass table. Put it gently down in front of us, while Abel started lining the coke up. The two guys then left the room. They were running a trap house nearby. I don't even fucking remember. Too many drugs, too much vodka, and too much of Abel's violent pressuring.\n\nHe turned his fucked up face to me. His right eye was completely red and he had a half-finished blunt burning between his lips.\n\n\"Valerie, you up first.\"\n\nHis smirked as I tried to steady myself. I stared at the coke lines for a few painful moments, not really hearing the moans from Natasha or whatever her fucking name was. I guess they were fucking right there. I looked in the lines and went for it. Just some fucking drugs, right?\n\nThe Weeknd-Houseof Balloons/Glass Table Girls",

Ella stood on the rooftop of her apartment building, the cool breeze ruffling her hair, as \"Riptide\" by Vance Joy played softly through her earbuds. She closed her eyes and let the melody wash over her, each note a reminder of the story she'd crafted around those lyrics—a story of longing and chance encounters.\n\nElla had always felt like she was caught in a riptide, pulled by unseen forces, unable to grasp what she truly wanted. She worked as an art restorer, a job that allowed her to touch history, but left her feeling disconnected from her own life. Her days were spent meticulously cleaning and repairing the past, while her nights were consumed by dreams of something more.\n\nThe lyrics spoke to her in ways she couldn't explain. \"I wish I was a bloody magpie / Cause magpies, they can steal your heart away,\" she mused, imagining herself clever and free, able to take what she desired without hesitation. In her mind, there was a man—a stranger with a smile that could light up her world, someone who could rescue her from the riptide if only she dared to let him in.\n\nOne evening, as she walked home from work, Ella found herself at the riverside park. The setting sun cast a golden glow over the water, and she sat on a bench, lost in thought. That's when she saw him—a young musician with a guitar, playing \"Riptide\" with a passion that made her heart skip a beat. His voice was raw and honest, echoing her own unspoken desires.\n\nHe finished his song and looked up, meeting Ella's eyes for the first time. There was an instant connection, a shared understanding that words were unnecessary. They talked about music, dreams, and the feeling of being adrift. As the night grew darker, they walked along the riverbank, the melody of the song playing in the background.\n\nElla realized that sometimes, the riptide wasn't something to be fought against, but embraced. It was a force that could bring unexpected treasures into her life, like this stranger who understood her without needing to be told. For the first time in a long while, she felt the pull of the riptide guiding her towards something real—a chance at love and a life beyond the confines of her routine.\n\nAs they parted ways, Ella knew this wasn't the end of her story, but a beautiful beginning. The riptide had brought her something she'd longed for, and with it, the courage to face whatever came next.",

He needed to dig a grave, a deep, narrow hole to welcome back one who had been a friend, a brother. Thomas had known James since childhood, sharing secrets and dreams beneath the very trees that now stood as silent sentinels over this somber task. Their friendship was a tapestry of laughter and support, woven through the years with threads of shared adventures and quiet moments.

    "HWT": "Arizona is a hot and sparse state, and you wouldn't except much to happen there. That is, unless, you look underground. Deep below the deserts, and below the crust of the very earth, a subterranean research lab is located. It is full of many eager young college graduates, or at least they were young. The lab has been forgotten by the government, and only three dedicated researchers remain to uncover the secrets of the depths of the earth.\n\nDr. Feldman is the oldest of the group, and spends most of his time reading the great works of the scientific community.\n\nDr. Mccarter is the youngest of the group, and uses her energy primarily for risky experimental endeavors, much to the annoyance of Dr. Feldman\n\nDr. Sheldon is mid-aged, and spends his time cleaning up the messes of the other researchers.\n\nOne day, Dr. Mccarter was trying to think of something to do. That week, she had already grown 4 new types of plants, and genetically modified a squid to be able to breathe oxygen through the air... for about 30 seconds. What else could there be? Suddenly, she had an idea. She rushed to the genetic manipulator and decided to create a virus, but with good intentions. She intended on creating the virus for elder people, in order to assist their aging digestive systems. Unfortunately, she misplaced a few genes, and made it so instead of assisting the digestive system, it made it so the digestive system slowly digested the human body! Immediately, she became the first victim and died within 24 hours. The other team realized this, and quarantined the entire facility before making their way back to civilization.",
    "MGT": "In the sterile environment of the National Institute of Viral Research, Dr. Helena Vasquez and her team huddled around a microscope, their eyes fixed on the petri dish before them. It had been a grueling effort to revive a pathogen believed extinct, buried deep within a layer of permafrost in the Siberian tundra. The team had discovered it only after a freak thaw, and excitement buzzed through the air like electricity. This was uncharted territory, a window into the past, and potentially, a key to understanding viral evolution.\n\nThe pathogen, dubbed \"Permafrost-1,\" was unlike any they had ever seen. Its virion structure was peculiar, with a helical tail and intricate protein spikes that seemed almost artistic in their complexity. Initial tests suggested it was a distant cousin of the ancient poxviruses, but its genetic code told a different story, one that hinted at an unprecedented mechanism of infection.\n\nThe team's goal was to understand its properties fully, but as they began the cautious process of culturing the virus, something unexpected happened. Rather than displaying the aggressive replication rates typical of ancient pathogens, Permafrost-1 began to exhibit a curious behavior. It seemed to thrive only in specific, low-oxygen environments, forming clusters that emitted a faint, bioluminescent glow.\n\nFascinated, Dr. Vasquez increased the oxygen levels to study the virus's response, but it resisted alteration. Instead, it started interacting with the host cells in an unexpected manner. The infected cells began producing a substance that resembled a natural antiviral, a sort of self-defense mechanism that the virus itself seemed to trigger.\n\nAs the team observed, it became clear that Permafrost-1 wasn't a killer virus, as they had initially feared. Instead, it appeared to be a symbiotic pathogen, one that coexisted with its host without causing harm. In fact, the bioluminescent glow seemed to act as a signal, perhaps to attract other organisms that could facilitate its spread in a mutually beneficial relationship.\n\nDr. Vasquez's eyes widened with realization. This was not a threat from the past, but a message. Permafrost-1 was a relic of a time when viruses and hosts had evolved together in harmony. It was a reminder that not all past interactions were hostile, and perhaps, a hint at how future ones could be.\n\nThe discovery shifted the team's focus. Instead of containment, they now explored the potential of Permafrost-1 as a tool for understanding symbiotic viral relationships. What they had feared as a harbinger of doom turned out to be a beacon of hope, illuminating a path to a new era of coexistence between humans and viruses.",

Yet beneath the surface, an ancient memory lingered, dormant, waiting.\n\nAuriel was a place of harmony, where technology and nature coexisted seamlessly. The people lived in blissful ignorance, their days filled with creativity and leisure. Yet, a sense of unfulfillment tugged at the edges of their consciousness, a whisper of something more.\n\nOne evening, as the twin moons cast a silver glow over the city, a celestial phenomenon occurred. The skies shimmered with colors unseen, and a gentle hum resonated through the air. The people of Auriel gathered at the city's heart, drawn by an inexplicable curiosity.\n\nAs the humming grew louder, a rift appeared in the sky, a portal of swirling stars and cosmic energy. From it emerged beings of light and wisdom, their forms ethereal and otherworldly. The people watched in awe, their hearts filled with wonder and trepidation.\n\n\"We are the Architects,\" the beings proclaimed, their voices like a gentle breeze. \"You are our creation, born of stardust and dreams.

Laughter erupted, breaking the ice and bringing a sense of normalcy back to the table.\n\nAs dessert was served, I realized that, despite the unexpected announcement, our family was just as strong and loving as ever. Mom's declaration was important, but it didn't change who she was or how much we cherished her. The warmth of the room returned, filled with the promise of more shared stories and love in the years to come."

Their night light illuminated smiles have faded from my mind's eye. Such happiness and warmth act only as dusted relics of a different world, a good world. Although her smile was lost, her hair was unwavering. The long, blonde strands still gleamed like golden fields of wheat, swaying in the rays of summer. I held her trembling head in my lap and slowly combed my fingers down her bangs. I swallowed the knot in my throat, but couldn't resist the silent tears as I raked tooth fragments and raw flesh from my child's hair. Rivers of maroon clumped the stalks of grain into an alien mess.\n\n\"Daddy, are we the bad guys?\"\n\nComposing myself, I answered, \"No baby girl, the bad guys were going to hurt you.

This delicate sphere mirrored the state of their emotions and relationship, its colors shifting with their feelings: warm and vibrant for love, cool and dull for distance.\n\nEmma and Lucas were childhood friends turned lovers, drawn together by shared laughter and dreams. Their Heartstone glowed with a soft amber light, symbolizing their growing bond. As their relationship deepened, the Heartstone’s light intensified, filling their home with a comforting warmth.\n\nBut love isn't without its trials. A misunderstanding led to a heated argument, and the Heartstone dimmed to a pale blue, reflecting the coldness between them. The change was startling, a tangible reminder of the rift. Lucas, determined to mend things, decided to confront Emma. As he spoke, the Heartstone flickered, responding to the sincerity in his voice.\n\nTogether, they realized the Heartstone wasn't just an object, but a guide—a reflection of their vulnerabilities and strengths. They learned to nurture it, understanding that its existence meant they could never ignore their feelings. The threat of destruction lingered; if the Heartstone shattered, their love might be lost forever.\n\nIn time, they grew wiser, cherishing the Heartstone’s presence as a symbol of their commitment. It transformed their relationship, teaching them the power of communication and forgiveness, and solidifying their bond in ways they never imagined possible."

People need to know what happened, so I think I can risk a little light to tell my story.\n\nThe world as I know it was lost 3 years ago. Thousands of years of human development and advancement lost in a mere three years... It's incredible what can be lost so quickly. Humanity had shifted from living rurally into living amongst each other in vast cities. Culture and technology thrived in these conditions but so did other things like what caused this mess. That's what I suspect at least. Or maybe it was the government. Hell I don't know and I don't care. Even before this I felt more at home in the wilderness. It's safer out here.\n\nAnyway, the cities fell in a few months and the more populated cities soon after that. You see, these \"zombies\" are a disease. Once bitten a person can go days without symptoms. But when they do happen, they happen fast. Once turned, there's no stopping them. They may be dumb and singleminded but damn are they fast.... And deadly.\n\nSo here I am. Traveling during the day and cowering at night. I figure my soul mission at this point is to pass on human knowledge in this little journal of mine. You can't kill em so you have to run. Some people fled to island chains but it turns out immortals don't need to breath and don't mind water. Some people hiked up mountains but those bastards found them too. The only thing you can do is keep moving. Come to think of it, two nights at one camp site is too long.

The confrontation was inevitable.\n\nThe first shot rang out, followed by a chorus of others. Chaos erupted as the undead surged from the shadows, their groans filling the air. Jake and Liam fought back-to-back, their movements a blur of precision and desperation. The battle raged on, each fallen foe a small victory in their struggle for survival.\n\nAs dawn broke, the silence that followed was not the peace they yearned for but a temporary reprieve. Jake and Liam returned to their community, weary but alive, their mission accomplished. The road ahead was fraught with peril, but for now, they had bought humanity a little more time.\n\nIn the command center, Maya watched them return, a glimmer of hope flickering in her eyes.

Eyes that are somewhere between the lightest green and the deepest blue. As if a new color was created for her alone to grace upon this world. When she looks back I'm utterly helpless and yet totally invincible. Time spent with her is the closest to paradise I'm sure I'll ever get. Time spent away from her is crippling torture with only the thought of her radiant smile and ever optimistic nature to keep me from going mad. She is my sole motivation. She gets me out of bed in the morning. I would sacrifice anything and everything for her happiness. Yet, I hesitate. She seems so far away yet so attainable. I question myself every moment we spend together. I should be able to tell her, but I stop myself before I have the chance to form those words.

Yuki wasn't just any gun-slinging bounty hunter; she was a relic from a time when the old ways meshed with the new—a fusion of tradition and technology.\n\nAs she approached the back alley known as the \"Ghost Corral,\" a figure emerged from the shadows, the glint of his mechanical arm catching her eye. \"Yuki Tanaka, the legend,\" he drawled, his voice a mix of gravel and silk. \"I hear you're the best in the business.\"\n\n\"Only the best get through the Ghost Corral,\" Yuki replied, her voice steady as the rain. She dismounted, the sound of her boots on the slick pavement echoing through the narrow space.\n\nThey exchanged a series of moves, a dance as old as time, blending hand-to-hand combat with the precision of cybernetic enhancements. Sparks flew, and the cybernetic gunfire blended with the rhythm of the rain. In the end, Yuki stood victorious, her opponent lying defeated.\n\nAs she walked away, the neon lights continued to dance around her, a reminder that even in this futuristic world, the spirit of the cowboy still rode strong."

There are no laws to protect you, because you do not exist. Yet, you are invincible.\n\nYou have fought, without backup. without defense. Without tools or resources. You have lost your careers, your livelihoods, your dreams, your passions, and you have won progress.\n\nYou have won the right to exist. And my friends, my brothers and sisters, that is something that can't be taken away. Your stories can't be unheard. This next battle is not yours to fight, but it will be yours to win. Lawyers and litigation can not make inroads without humans, without passion and compassion. And you, my family and my wingmen, have blazed a trail anyone can see. You have changed the world.\n\nTomorrow, Congress will hear your voices. We should win. The generals and commanders have seen the value you bring to our military. I can not predict the future, however. If the worst should happen, we will fight again.\n\nHowever, if the law and justice are on our side, my wingmen, then tomorrow shall see the first day of your service. Open. Legal. Supported.

As night fell, I resolved to uncover the mysteries of this parallel existence, determined to understand the changes I could no longer ignore."

It was dark, and although my car was nice, the bourbon did a great job of dulling my senses. I just stayed on my back, and let my eyes shut....\n\nMy eyes pop open to the feeling of sun on my face. I look to my left. Where did the road go? Then my eyes drift to the right. No car either? I frantically get to my feet and look around. The wooded area that was in front of me is still there, but the road has vanished. It has merely been replaced by more trees, endless amounts of trees. My mind races, I run, trying to find my way back to the road. I must have been sleepwalking. I sprint through the trees, searching for the wreck I hoped was just a bad dream. I leave the trees, and the view in front of me opens up.\n\nMy mouth drops as the enormity of whats in front of me hits me. The forest was everywhere within sight, no highway, no buildings, just trees. Well trees and the volcano. But that's been dormant for years...?\n\nThe eruption shook the ground and nearly forced me over the edge of the cliff. As I stand there, I realize that this must be a dream, there's no way this could possibly be happening. One look over the edge makes me realize how I can wake up from this drunken nightmare. Just a few steps and a jump, and I will fly back to my drunken self sitting on the side of the road with the police pulling up. All I have to do is jump. But what benefit would that give me? I have no family, few friends, and my job sucks. I would be going back to a shitty job, no car, and a DUI. What was the rush?\n\nSo for now I'll sit, relax, and enjoy the view.",

I was no longer in my cozy, modern apartment; I had somehow traveled sixty million years into the past.\n\nMy clothes, once crisp and comfortable, were now damp and covered in a fine layer of dirt.

I ventured cautiously into the underbrush, my footsteps muffled by a carpet of fallen leaves. The earth beneath me was alive with the sounds of insects and the rustle of small creatures. My mind raced with thoughts of what this world must have been like sixty million years ago, teeming with life forms long extinct.\n\nAs I walked, the night began to reveal itself. A gentle breeze carried the sound of water nearby. Following the distant gurgle, I found myself at the edge of a river, its waters sparkling under the light of the stars. The reflection of the trees danced on its surface, creating a mesmerizing scene. I knelt down, dipping my hand into the cool water, marveling at its purity.\n\nIn the distance, I spotted movement.

In their attempt to protect a rare and powerful bloom, they had inadvertently disrupted the planet's energies. The bloom, known as the Heart of Selene, had thrummed with a force that was not meant to be harnessed.\n\nThe planet, sentient and vast, felt the imbalance. It groaned and shifted, its tectonic plates murmuring in discontent. Weather patterns spiraled into chaos, with storms brewing where calm seas once lay. The guardians, realizing their error, convened under the canopy of stars.\n\n\"We must make amends,\" declared the eldest guardian, his voice echoing like rustling leaves. \"The Heart of Selene was not meant for us to control. We must return it to its rightful place in the earth.\"\n\nTogether, they embarked on a perilous journey, weaving through tangled roots and over craggy terrain. The forest, sensing their quest, lent its strength, guiding them to the bloom's sacred grove. There, they placed the Heart back into the nurturing soil, where it began to pulse gently, its rhythm harmonizing with the planet's heartbeat.\n\nAs the guardians returned to their duties, the planet sighed in relief. The storm clouds parted, revealing a sky of healing blues. The guardians, humbled by their lesson, vowed to respect the natural order, ensuring that their actions always aligned with the greater balance.\n\nThus, the mystical forest flourished once more, a testament to the guardians' renewed commitment to the planet they had, albeit momentarily, pained."

It was successful enough that most people wanted it, and positive enough that the government forced criminals to get it.\nThe technical name was a little bit too difficult for most people. In short, it was a chemical castration. A very specific gland in your brain was killed, so that a certain reaction would be supressed.\nIm a very few years, Passion crimea went down 98 %, as did club and bar fighting, and sport related incidents.\nViolence slowly fade from society. Crime still existed, but now it was always cold and calculated.\nthe impulse of violence, the uncontrollable burst was now gone. The castration gave people up to five minutes of time between the trigger and the cause, overruling evolution.\nNow we get to think. After five minutes, kicking someone's ass is not such a good idea anymore.\nOf course you know the rest. Now we live in a society where the youngest generation is completely oblivious to violent behaviour. So maybe when their turn comes, there won't be wars at all.

Everyone thought I was going to crack one day and turn into a killer. I was treated like a ticking time bomb. I cant even count the number of visits I've gotten from police and government agencies. Half of them treated me like scum and the other half like I was a mental patient. It all made me sick but after all this time I can hardly blame them. I have been so alone and so shunned by everyone that I can almost imagine one day just doing it. Almost. My parents had always said they didn't believe it, that one day I would see that things aren't always as they appear and that hopefully that happened before it was too late. They always said that I was too kind hearted to do something like that. I just wondered if Ted Bundy's parents had thought the same thing.\nTonight was like many other nights.

    "MGT_raw": "Evelyn stumbled upon the dusty old diary in her grandmother's attic, its pages yellowed with age. The entries were penned by a woman named Clara, whose life seemed remarkably parallel to Evelyn's own. Clara had written of dreams deferred, ambitions stifled, and a longing for a world beyond the four walls of her quaint home.\n\nOne entry from 1952 caught Evelyn's eye: \"Tonight, I shall step outside my garden and into the unknown. The city awaits, with its lights and possibilities.\" The words resonated deeply, igniting a spark within Evelyn. She traced the inked lines, feeling Clara's courage pulse through her veins.\n\nAs the sun dipped below the horizon, Evelyn decided. Tomorrow, she would leave her routine life behind and chase the dreams she had buried for so long.

Why they decided to name an 18 year old from Pennsylvania as it's leader, I couldn't tell you. However, I have settled in alright I guess. The only problem that I have encountered so far was the language barrier, but I brought translators from the states with me.\n\nI have been worrying about today though. I am meeting with ambassadors from South Korea at 5 o'clock for a dinner meeting. My council has also told me today that a parade is being done 'in my honor ', but it really is just to immediate the ambassadors. I told them that I was upset that they kept this from me and I would talk to them when it was completed. They started crying when I left the room to go eat breakfast.\n\nThere is a lot of work I have to do in this country. I share the idea of many Koreans to see a unified Korea. They have given me the nickname of \"The White Knight\" due to, well I guess it is because I am white.\n\nAfter I am done with the meeting I will be flying to New York for a UN Meeting and to meet with the US President. To think when I was born she was the First Lady. But still, this isn't what I expected to be my first trip to the big apple to be like.\n\nI need to go and get ready for the parade. I will be back in North Korea in a few days. Hopefully I will be able to wake up from this nightmare, because if not God is playing a very cruel joke.",

Talking mimes are scary, but they sure as hell aren't intimidating.\n\nToday, I felt like doing a few tricks most mimes do. The typical rope trick, the \"walk through a wind tunnel\" gag, and even a few invisible walls. I jokingly put myself into a tiny box also, before doing a grand finale of pouring invisible water and then spitting out real water looking at the daily paper.\n\nPeople were laughing and I got some money put away into my box, laid a few feet away. I decided to start wrapping it up and went into my box trick. Some people played along and I decided to finish up.\n\nBut the thing is I was stuck.\n\nI never done this before. I didn't know that doing a box trip could actually trap you. People were laughing, and I struggle to yell for help. Some looked like they were clapping but I couldn't hear them. Soundproof walls?! Fuck!\n\nI tried taking my shirt off or something so that police would try escorting me away but I was too squeezed into this box.

He was going to use an old trick, one he'd thought of a long time ago. He glided through the house, careful not to wake anyone – kids' bedrooms shut, with names on all the doors. He made his way through the house, turning on every faucet he found. Finally, he came to the kitchen, triggered the sprinkler head, and waited as water splashed from the ceiling. Five or six kids, he thought, would fly down the stairs into the kitchen – the common area of the house – where he could scare the living shit out of them. But no one came immediately. After a couple of minutes, a couple, likely in their fifties now, slowly climbed down the stairs. They looked so weary, so utterly worn. But he was ready. He steadied his stance, prepared to stare them head-on as chaos whirled around him. When the woman saw him, she froze. *There we go, * he thought.

The Earth person was leaning in and Klath could smell the thick reek of insincerity. It made the membranes on its eyes itch. Klath nodded again, somewhat impatiently. The sign DID say \"I am fluent, speak freely\" in the thirty most common Earth dialects. Supposedly this subject was literate.\n\nCarol flipped her hair over to a more decisively non-flirtatious angle as the huge bug placed the YES cue card on the table and, after a moment of silent eye contact, picked it back up again.

We were never close. Though, in this moment I could remember a particular time when I was young, and she was less likely to be drunk on a Wednesday. I remember the warm touch of her hand on my face as I sat crying, knee skinned from falling off my bike, exaggerating the pain as children tend to do. All I wanted in that moment was comfort. To feel as though everything would be okay and yet she couldn't seem to make that happen; just as I was never able to comfort her in the depths of her sorrow.

It starts with exactly one minute of silence, followed by bursts of increasing intensity, from the base, they are successively twice, thrice, five times, seven times, eleven times stronger.\"\n\n\"Primes,\" the captain muttered under his breath.\n\n\"Exactly, sir. Following that is what appears to be a binary sequence, with each bit lasting exactly one thousandth of a second. It has repeated three times now. I believe it may be a distress signal. Should we check it out, sir?\"\n\n\"Ensign, you know that that star system is twenty light years away. If they used photon emissions for their distress signal, they're probably long gone.\"\n\n\"That's what I thought, sir. But look at the numbers encoded within the binary string. 389, that's the ratio between the lunar and solar distance of earth. 9993, that's the speed of light's ratio to the earth's orbital speed. And there are more. Sir, these numbers only make sense on earth.

You can't cook the flesh, but you can do a lot with the right preparation.

When there's nothing to stimulate you, the mind collapses on itself like a hellish spiral. I need to keep thinking, need to keep myself from slipping away into nothingness. It's so difficult, so difficult to keep focused, so difficult to fight on. There has to be something else, something on the other side, right? I can feel it draining me, chipping away at my being. My memories are melting as well, crumbling like dry sand. I don't want to disappear, don't want to vanish! As long as I keep thinking, I exist! Is this what death really feels like?

I could feel the knowledge of every chord, riff, and solo coursing through my veins.\n\nFlushed with excitement, I leaned forward. \"Second wish: I want to win the lottery. Like, the big one. Billionaire big.\"\n\nThe genie chuckled, a sound like wind chimes in a gentle breeze. \"Fate shall weave your fortune,\" he declared, and the air shimmered around me, the numbers aligning in my mind like a cosmic jackpot.\n\nThe room spun slightly as I caught my breath, my heart racing with the possibilities. The genie stood tall, his presence commanding yet comforting. \"Your final wish,\" he prompted, his voice trailing off like smoke into the ceiling.\n\nI hesitated, the weight of the moment pressing down. \"I want to find true happiness,\" I said, unsure if it was too vague or too ambitious. But as I spoke, a warmth spread through me, a feeling of peace that settled deep in my bones.\n\nThe genie's eyes softened. \"A noble wish,\" he said gently. \"True happiness is found within, but I will guide you toward it.\"\n\nWith a wave of his hand, the smoke from my bong began to swirl around us, forming images of laughter, love, and moments of simple joy.

Each key was a string to somewhere in the world -- Berlin, Tokyo, D. C., and when he died, the world continued anyway. A room tucked away in the suburbs had gone dark, but all around homes grew with a distant warmth as night met the day as if it were any other.\n\nThe screen still teemed with life in that darkness, staring back at me as I sat in that same chair, deaf to the creaking. My fingertips felt along the keys, letters kissed by the faint moonlight, and as the machine grew to its lively hum once more, I looked to the door and saw out clearly into a room now empty.\n\nA table sat alone in the middle of it, stripped of its cloth, silverware, china -- a stillness disturbed by the whirring of the world.",

A contented smile spread across her face as she watched the world around her gradually come back to life.\n\nIn this world bound by battery life, the simple act of charging had become a powerful ritual of renewal, reminding everyone of the delicate balance between technology and existence."

    "MGT_raw": "On a stormy night, driven by desperation, I found myself in an ancient alleyway, the kind that legends whispered about. The air was thick with the scent of rain on cobblestones and something else—a faint, almost intoxicating aroma of something forbidden. Across from me, a figure emerged from the shadows, his eyes glinting with an otherworldly allure. He introduced himself as Mr. Devlin, but I knew better. He was the devil, or at least the closest thing to it I’d ever encountered.\n\nThe exchange was quick and unceremonious. I handed over my sole, my one good shoe, for a promise of prosperity beyond my wildest dreams. Mr. Devlin extended a hand, and in an instant, I felt a surge of energy, my life transformed. My business flourished, wealth amassed, but the price was far from over.\n\nIn the morning, I awoke to a burning sensation in my foot. Panic set in as I discovered my sole—literally—was missing. Not just the shoe, but my foot's skin was gone, replaced by a raw, exposed patch. Horror struck when I realized the devil had made a terrible typo in his contract. I was to give up not my sole, but my sole alone.\n\nDays turned into weeks, and I navigated life on one good foot and a crutch. Every step was a reminder of my folly—a living testament to deals with devils and the importance of reading the fine print. As I limped along, I often wondered whether the riches were worth this painful reminder of a night best forgotten."

    "HWT": "I could feel it, *sense it*, a full second before it happened. An eternity in that second. Every connection in my body lit up softly, like the memory of a camp fire while camping with my Dad, the last time I saw him before he left my mom. Every cell twinged with a sharpness, like the guilt I felt getting caught with my first porno mag as a teen. My heart burned like the passion I felt in church or the first time I kissed a girl or the day I married my wife. That indescribable, holy passion. And my soul ached like the day I buried my daughter in the ground. That ground, now gone. Indescribable agony. Blinding, searing, numbing pain. In that second, every hair on my neck stood at attention. I could feel it in the room. We all felt it. The thing that connected us to each other, that grounded us, made us as one... was gone. The only thing that remained was the empty, sinking feeling we all felt inside, welled up in our stomachs. In our throats. In our souls.\n\nIn an instant, a blinding flash had taken our home from us. All of our genius, our wisdom, the collected knowledge of countless human civilizations had been no match for time. For nature. We felt it, and in that moment before it happened... we knew. Time had orphaned us. There was no going back. Our fate was no longer tied to Earth. There was no more Earth.\n\nAs our ship retreated from that flashing, blinding light, that final symbol of the home we had loved so much... we took our final longing glance and retreated further into the blackness of space. We were strangers, we were orphans. We were hopelessly lost.",

The mission had been arduous, filled with countless hours of training, rigorous protocols, and the weight of being humanity's emissary. Yet, there was also a profound excitement that coursed through Elara's veins—an excitement rooted in the unknown.\n\nElara had grown up on Earth, her childhood stories filled with tales of space exploration and the promise of new frontiers. Now, she stood at the frontier herself, ready to step into history. The mission was simple: to establish a preliminary colony on Xylophius, a planet that, after years of research, had been deemed habitable for human life. The future of humanity rested on their shoulders.\n\nAs the final preparations were made, Elara felt an unexpected pang of nostalgia. She thought about her family, her friends, and the places that had shaped her. She remembered her mother’s smile, the way the autumn leaves would crunch underfoot in their backyard, and the smell of her father’s coffee in the morning. Earth, with all its chaos and beauty, had been her home. Leaving it was like leaving a part of herself behind.\n\nThe farewell was bittersweet. A hushed silence fell over the launchpad as the crowd held their breath, watching the spacecraft ascend, a streak of light against the dawn sky. Elara could see her family among the spectators, waving, their faces a tapestry of hope and sorrow. She imagined the tears and the embraces that would follow once they knew she was truly gone.\n\nAs the distance between Earth and the spacecraft grew, the planet seemed to shrink, becoming a mere dot in the vastness of space. Yet, in her heart, Elara carried with her the essence of Earth—its sounds, its scents, its life. She knew that the stories she would tell about it would become the legends of the new world.\n\nXylophius awaited, a fresh canvas for humanity’s dreams. As the spacecraft settled into orbit, Elara turned her gaze to the horizon of this alien world, its landscape an enigma waiting to be unraveled. With a deep breath, she stepped forward, ready to embrace the future, carrying the farewell of Planet Earth with her wherever she went.",

Either way, it meant the world to her.\n\nI promised to keep her secret, but as you know, I have a penchant for spilling beans. Or perhaps I never spilled them. Maybe Clara's secret was never revealed. You see, I might have told it to everyone in town, or maybe I only muttered it under my breath while taking a stroll by the river. The river is a fine place for secrets, isn’t it?\n\nOne day, Clara disappeared. Some say she left town, others claim she vanished into thin air. I might have seen her in a café in Paris, or maybe it was just a dream. I could have been the one who orchestrated her disappearance, or perhaps I'm the one who's gone missing. Who can say?\n\nYou might think I’m unreliable, and you’d be right. I’m as trustworthy as a house of cards in a hurricane. But I have a reason, a good reason. You see, Clara once told me that the truth is subjective, that reality is a matter of perspective. So, I’ve decided to give you mine.\n\nWas I at the café on 5th Street? Did Clara have a life-altering secret? Did I betray her trust? These are questions I can’t answer, not even to myself. But one thing is certain: in a world where the truth is as elusive as a shadow in the dark, isn’t it better to embrace the mystery?\n\nSo, dear reader, take this story with a grain of salt, a pinch of sugar, and a dash of skepticism. After all, in the end, isn’t life itself an unreliable narrator?"

She lay still, unsure why she was awake till her ears picked up on a subtle difference in the noises of the night-creaking wood more than the house settling, a stiring of the air that she could feel even in her room, and around these lay an absolute silence; she noticed belatedly not even birds were signing under the gaze of the moon.\n\nIt took her a few more seconds before she sat up, her ears straining into the dark to catch the near imperceptible disturbances.

Silently, she swung her legs over the bed, and stepped lightly on the wood beneath her feet. She crept towards the door, making sure to step on the quietest planks of wood as she went. In her head, her increasingly panicked mind was tracking the stranger in the hall, calculating when he would inevitably reach her door. That internal clock reached zero right as she reached the door, and frantically turned the lock. The slight jangle of the handle sounded like a church bell in the quiet. She sensed more than felt the thing in the other side pause.\n\nThen the handel turned, halting against the tumblers. Then there was another sound, quiet as a whisper.

She took a deep breath, feeling the weight of the decision she had made.\n\nSuddenly, a loud roar interrupted her thoughts. Turning around, she saw a massive, shadowy figure descending from the skies. It was a dragon, scales glittering like emeralds in the dying light.

    "MGT_raw": "Lara stood at the edge of the cliff, the ocean breeze tugging gently at her hair. Below, the waves crashed against jagged rocks, sending whitecaps into the air. She clutched the worn leather journal to her chest, its pages filled with secrets she was determined to keep hidden. The sun was beginning its descent, painting the sky in hues of orange and purple. She took a deep breath, feeling the weight of the decision she had made.\n\nSuddenly, a loud roar interrupted her thoughts. Turning around, she saw a massive, shadowy figure descending from the skies. It was a dragon, scales glittering like emeralds in the dying light. Fear gripped her heart, but she remained rooted to the spot, mesmerized by the creature's majesty. The dragon landed beside her, its eyes piercing and intelligent.\n\n\"Traveler,\" the dragon spoke, its voice a deep rumble that echoed through the air, \"why do you seek the secrets of the journal?\"\n\nLara hesitated, then nodded. \"I must protect them. They hold the key to a power that could change everything.\"\n\nThe dragon inclined its head, a gesture that felt oddly respectful. \"Then join me, for I am the Guardian of the Isles. Together, we shall ensure the knowledge remains hidden.\"\n\n---\n\nThe next morning, Lara found herself in a bustling marketplace, far removed from the cliffs and the dragon.

As archaeologist and historians we must never forget the tragedy that betook our home world. Back then, they were all looking for the wrong signs, everyone expected for the world to unexpectedly implode in seconds, but it didn't, and so they laughed and moved on with their lives. Absolutely no-one paid serious attention to the steady and constant rise of the Earth's temperature. Scientist were fighting left and right, politicians and business men were lining their pockets, and the plebeians complained about the heat. When all this was happening the Showreins were silently rubbing their pudgy hands in benign bemusement, whilst praying to their pagan gods to bless \"this earth\". Who would have ever expected such a tragedy, the first encounter with extraterrestrials, to be the last. As everyone now knows, the Showreins are exquisite gourmet chefs who pride themselves in their careful and meticulous cooking preparations, they started in 2012 AD and ended, well you know when. If we did not have a colony on mars at the time, humans would no longer exist. Hence this is why this paper should be taking seriously, for it has come to my attention, that once again, our world is being slowly cooked.",

    "HWT": "You never realize how much last words mean until you have absolutely no way of knowing when the end will come. That's the worst part about all this, the suddenness of it all. I'll be in the middle of a casual conversation with the nice old woman who runs the flower shop, or the balding man at the deli counter, and then I'll be addressing the empty air as the bouquet of daisies or half-cut ham falls to the floor. Just like that, gone.\n\nThe worst part of it all – aside from the fact that anyone I know could disappear at any moment – is the Sound. Picture a small child, cheeks filled with air, waiting for the unsuspecting parent to doze off. He creeps up, right up close, to their ear and releases the air in a concentrated little *pop*. That's the sound people make when they go. It's the sound I dread most now, more than the whine of a police siren or the cry of a newborn baby. I'd rather hear the immense metallic racket of a car crash than that ghastly little *pop*, but I fear the time for accidents has long since passed. There's simply no one left to have them.\n\nI walk the streets aimlessly, hoping against hope that I'll round the corner and stumble across a familiar face. I turn on the television, but every channel's static. At least it's a reminder that there used to be life, just as each little *pop* is the announcement of someone's death. Wherever I go, the Sound cuts through the silence.\n\nAnd now it's just me, left to carry the torch of humanity for as long as I'm able.\n\nI wonder if I'll hear my own little *pop* when I go.",
    "MGT": "In a world where the apocalypse was not defined by nuclear winter or meteor strikes, but by the slow, inexorable drain of humanity's collective consciousness, the new end began quietly, almost unnoticed. It started with a rumor, whispered in the shadows of the internet, that people were losing their memories. At first, it seemed like an urban legend, a ghost story for the digital age.\n\nBut as days turned into weeks, the phenomenon grew undeniable. People awoke to find their pasts fading, their identities slipping through their fingers like grains of sand. The world's archives, once vast repositories of human knowledge, became mazes of missing data, half-written histories, and incomplete maps. Libraries, once bustling with seekers of knowledge, stood eerily silent, their shelves increasingly barren.\n\nAmidst this confusion, a group of survivors emerged, individuals who seemed immune to the amnesiac plague. They called themselves the Keepers, guardians of memory and knowledge. Their leader, a woman named Elara, was a historian by training and a natural leader by necessity. She had noticed the first signs of the fading, but it wasn't until she met others like her that she realized the extent of the catastrophe.\n\nThe Keepers traveled from town to town, gathering what fragments of memory they could salvage. They used what technology remained, recording oral histories and piecing together digital archives. Their mission was clear: to preserve what was left of humanity's story before it vanished altogether.\n\nOne evening, under a sky painted with the hues of an impending storm, Elara and her band of Keepers reached a small village on the brink of forgetting. The villagers, desperate to hold onto their past, welcomed them with open arms. Together, they gathered around bonfires, sharing stories and memories, weaving them into the fabric of their collective consciousness.\n\nAs the nights grew colder and the winds howled louder, Elara realized that the real apocalypse was not the loss of memory, but the fear of forgetting. The Keepers' efforts were not just about preserving the past, but about rekindling the hope and identity that bound humanity together.\n\nIn the heart of the village, they built a sanctuary, a place where stories could be shared and memories preserved. It became a beacon of light in a world dimming with forgetfulness, a testament to the resilience of the human spirit.\n\nIn this new apocalypse, the battle was not against external forces, but against the erosion of the self. And in the end, it was the stories of people, woven together by the Keepers, that held the power to save them all.",

    "HWT": "You wouldn't know it by the badge, but I'm as much a fan of good fun as the next guy. Just last week I'd gotten a call from John Mayers, cashier at the feed mill, about ATV tracks left in his yard, third weekend in a row. Considering his lawn wasn't much more than a sunbaked square of dirt, and Mr. Mayers was a loudmouth & notoriously shit tipper at Peg's, I considered this incident listed in favor of the greater good. Kids need a domain to call their own, a way to blow off steam.\n\nBut to bludgeon a creature like this...this didn't suit the values of Johnsville at all.\n\nThe bat laid by the animal's side, sticky with its blood, blonde hair clinging in patches as low as the first pass of electrical tape on the handle. A pickup truck ambled past and kicked up a cloud of dust, driver and passenger craning to see the crime scene just off the road's shoulder– the couple looked familiar, perhaps from a town over, and we exchanged a quick wave. Prints would be next to impossible here in the mud, but it hardly mattered. One of' em had left a calling card - a greasy trucker's cap that had once been a bright Petty blue, almost for certain a proud piece of daily attire. There were benefits to moving into a small town – sometimes the criminals went right ahead and solved the case for you.\n\nAs I went to wrap the carcass in a white sheet, a glimmer of metal caught the sun. A dog tag, shaped like a squat bone, stamped only ' 4-10-1996 '.\n\nBy my guess, she was eighteen years old...and she didn't even have a name.",

In the sprawling city that never sleeps, anonymity had become her shield, a way to navigate the labyrinthine streets without the burden of identity.\n\nBy day, she moved through crowds like a shadow, blending into the sea of faces. Her life was a series of forgotten encounters, fleeting moments that left no trace. She worked as a barista in a small café tucked away on a side street, where the scent of freshly ground coffee beans mingled with the hum of whispered secrets. Patrons came and went, each leaving behind a piece of their story, but none lingered long enough to be remembered.\n\nHer evenings were spent wandering the city's hidden corners, exploring the places tourists never saw. She watched sunsets from rooftops and listened to the symphony of distant traffic. The city was her canvas, and she painted her existence with strokes of freedom and solitude.\n\nOne night, as she sat on a bench by the river, a sudden rain began to fall. She watched the drops create ripples on the water, each one a reminder of the transient nature of life. It was then that a stranger approached her, an old man with kind eyes and a gentle smile.\n\n\"Excuse me, young lady,\" he said, pulling out an umbrella to shield them both. \"You seem lost in thought.\"\n\nShe nodded, offering a small smile. \"Just thinking about names,\" she replied, her voice barely above a whisper.\n\nThe old man chuckled softly. \"Names are curious things, aren't they?

It was the beginning of something new, a promise of identity and self-discovery. And as she walked home under the starlit sky, she felt a sense of belonging she had never known before. Aurora.

He looked and looked and before long his eyes clouded over with tears and they overflowed and ran down his face. I glanced down, a tear running down my own face. I couldn't imagine what the image was that would bring a person to tears. I pulled my phone out and sent a text to Courtney, telling her I would be home soon. When I looked up the man was gone.\n\nI jumped up and looked around, to see if I could offer comfort but I didn't see him. Quickly I strode over to his seat to see if maybe he had dropped something that would help me identify him, instead I saw the photograph, lying face down.\n\nI reached out and grabbed the photograph and flipped it over and looked at it and saw the man with his new born son, holding him in his arms and gazing so lovingly.\n\nI took the picture, and put it in my wallet.

    "HWT": "I unfolded my arms from my chest, feeling blood surge back into them. With painstaking slowness but total silence, I reached up and removed my rucksack from under my neck, wincing as the kinks in my neck twanged and took up the load of my head. I found the tiny, tough thread of fishing line twisted around my belt loop and drew it taught, then gave it a slow pull. There was a dull clank on the other side of the hatchway as the exterior handle was released. Then I pushed against the metallic wall behind and above me, causing the rolling metal tray to whisper along the rails, and my toes rested lightly on the metal door. I gave the lightest of pushes.\n\nLight poured in around the edges of the hatch as it opened a quarter of an inch. Good, it was dawn. I listened intently for a very long moment, but heard nothing: no slither of flesh, drip of bile, clack of bone, or creak of spoiled larynges. Still moving slowly, I slid the tray farther along the rails, causing the hatch to swing open with a muted creaking. I quickly wound my precious length of fishing line around my fingers, watching the knotted loop at the end skitter along the floor as it scampered around the steel table leg I was using as a pulley in my hatch-release system. Then I turned, lowered my legs, and stood, stamping a little to restore circulation as I swung my rucksack back into place on my shoulder. I took a step, then hesitated and turned, pushing the tray back into the recesses of the morgue refrigerator and carefully shutting the hatch. In these times, if you found a safe hiding place, you saved it, in case you had to come back in a hurry.\n\nAs I set out again, I wondered if it was ironic that a morgue drawer would be a safe haven for the living hiding from the undead.",
    "MGT": "I awoke with a start, confusion clouding my mind as my vision slowly adjusted to the dim light. I was lying in a cramped space, surrounded by chilling silence, save for the faint hum of fluorescent lights above. My heart pounded in my chest, desperate to comprehend the surreal situation. I realized I was in a drawer at the morgue, surrounded by other empty compartments, each one eerily silent, each one a reminder of lives that had passed.\n\nA wave of panic washed over me as I struggled to sit up, the cool metal of the drawer pressing against my skin. I scrambled to steady myself, my eyes flickering open to take in the details of my surroundings. The morgue was a sterile, white-tiled room, filled with the faint smell of disinfectant. The drawers were neatly aligned, each one a temporary resting place for the deceased, waiting to be identified or claimed by loved ones.\n\nMy mind raced, trying to piece together how I ended up here. The last thing I remembered was leaving a bar with friends, a night filled with laughter and drinks. The rest was a blank, a void where my memories should be. I forced myself to stand, my legs wobbly with the effort, careful not to disturb the fragile peace of this mausoleum-like room.\n\nI heard footsteps approaching, the muffled sound growing louder as someone moved through the hall outside. My heart skipped a beat. Was I discovered? Was someone coming to realize I was here? The door swung open, and a figure stepped into the room, wearing the familiar white coat of a mortician. The mortician paused at my drawer, peering down with a furrowed brow.\n\n\"Are you alright?\" they asked, their voice calm and professional, yet tinged with concern. My throat went dry as I tried to form words. \"I need help,\" I finally managed, my voice hoarse with fear.\n\nThe mortician knelt beside me, their expression softening. \"Take a deep breath,\" they advised, reaching for my hand. \"Let's get you out of here.\" As I was lifted from the drawer, my mind began to clear. Panic slowly gave way to relief, but a nagging question lingered: How did I end up in the morgue?\n\nAs I was escorted out of the room, the mortician reassured me they would help me piece together the night. But for now, all I wanted was the comfort of familiar surroundings, away from the cold embrace of the morgue's drawers. That night, I would sleep in my own bed, safe, and ponder the strange twist of fate that had led me there, hoping against hope that my memory would return, piece by piece.",

My heart skipped a beat. Was I discovered? Was someone coming to realize I was here? The door swung open, and a figure stepped into the room, wearing the familiar white coat of a mortician. The mortician paused at my drawer, peering down with a furrowed brow.\n\n\"Are you alright?\" they asked, their voice calm and professional, yet tinged with concern. My throat went dry as I tried to form words. \"I need help,\" I finally managed, my voice hoarse with fear.\n\nThe mortician knelt beside me, their expression softening. \"Take a deep breath,\" they advised, reaching for my hand. \"Let's get you out of here.\" As I was lifted from the drawer, my mind began to clear. Panic slowly gave way to relief, but a nagging question lingered: How did I end up in the morgue?\n\nAs I was escorted out of the room, the mortician reassured me they would help me piece together the night. But for now, all I wanted was the comfort of familiar surroundings, away from the cold embrace of the morgue's drawers. That night, I would sleep in my own bed, safe, and ponder the strange twist of fate that had led me there, hoping against hope that my memory would return, piece by piece."

Shadows leapt up the dank brick walls from guttering candles, fitful in the damp night breeze. The dark shapes tantalised the eye, flitting and reaching, resembling shadows of great demons and lesser creatures of evil.\n\n\"Diablo, my pet,\" Maleficent murmured, holding her hand toward the raven perched upon a heavy beam that spanned the ceiling. Instantly the bird spread its wings and flew down to his mistress, landing on the huge obsidian ring the witch wore on her long thin forefinger. His yellow eye steadily met her weary gaze. She reached with her free hand to stroke his head, tickling him under the beak.\n\n\"Diablo, my love. You, and only you, understand me. I am tired from these years of unyielding search. I am weary of these subservient creatures who fail me each and every time. Crow, it is up to you now. I know you will not fail me, my lovely.\"\n\nA long look of understanding and sympathy passed between the pair, linked as they were in their goals and strange and wicked past.\n\nMaleficent raised her hand, closed her eyes as she felt the soft warmth of the bird's feathers upon her cheek. She touched her lips to his yellow beak and he gave a soft caw; he flapped his great wings and flew from the tower, leaving his mistress alone in the night.",

The creature wriggled free, its eyes wide with surprise at the figure towering over it.\n\nAs she helped it to its feet, Maleficent found herself whispering soothing words, her voice softer than any had heard before.

It was a stormy evening when her world crumbled. Returning from a charity gala, she braved the heavy rain, the streetlights flickering above like dying stars. In a moment of inattention, she slipped on the slick pavement, her body tumbling into the path of the oncoming car. The impact was instantaneous, the world blurring into a haze of pain and shock. As the ambulance sirens wailed in the distance, her consciousness slipped away. In her final moments, she was alone, her fortress of arrogance shattered, unable to reach out for the compassion she so desperately needed. Her dreams of redemption died with her, leaving behind a legacy of shattered perceptions and unfulfilled potential. The world, now smaller without her, moved on, forgetting the warmth that had briefly flickered in her eyes."

Say a Wednesday, perhaps the 9th? Yes, the 9th... *\n\nLoki sat in the corner, rocking back and forth. Hermes sat staring blankly at the TV and Anansi was intermittently eating little snack cakes and chainsmoking cigarette after cigarette after cigarette. Finally Hermes snapped out of his fugue and screamed. \"Where the fuck is he!?\" Anansi dropped his cake and cursed. Loki spasmed, and then began to cry.\n\nThe door opened and in shuffled a rather sheepish Coyote. Without a word Hermes grabbed him and wordlessly slammed the *other* Trickster into the wall. Then he did it again. And again. And a few more times before he started screaming his rage, it was simply noise and fury and fear. Finally the mercurial messenger slumped to the floor as well after releasing Coyote.\n\nTo his credit Coyote took it in stride. The slamming had damaged the wall no small amount, and Coyote took a moment to wipe away the bits of blood trickling from the corners of his mouth and nose. He craned his neck until a resounding **crack** came forth and sighed. The pause had served its purpose, he made sure he had the attention of all present. He only said one thing before the rest was lost as the entire world went mad.\n\n\"So you know how sometimes a Trickster's pranks come back and bite him in the ass?\"",

Anansi spun a web of stories, each thread a tale of wonder and deception. Loki infused the narrative with chaos, ensuring that nothing was as it seemed. Coyote added layers of illusion, bending light and sound to his will. And Hermes, ever the messenger, ensured that the word of their prank spread like wildfire, drawing in the curious and the unsuspecting.\n\nThe day of the prank arrived, and the world watched in awe. A grand festival had been announced, promising wonder and delight. As the gates opened, the crowd was greeted by a spectacle unlike any other—a labyrinth that shifted and shimmered, its paths leading to impossible places.\n\nConfusion spread like ripples in a pond as people wandered through the maze, each twist and turn revealing a new surprise. Anansi's tales whispered in the air, Loki's chaos danced in the shadows, Coyote's illusions played tricks on the senses, and Hermes ensured that the experience was shared far and wide.\n\nAs dusk fell, the prank reached its crescendo, leaving the world in laughter and bewilderment.

She was a sophomore from Georgia, with just a hint of a drawl and a smile that made him wish he could make her laugh forever.\n\n\"I only like Coke,\" she said later that evening, when he asked if she wanted anything to drink. At first he wondered if it was just a Southern thing - they did refer to all soda Coke, after all - but she laughed and assured him that she really did love it. When he brought her the drink, she smiled, and they kissed for hours that night.\n\nThat was two years ago. She would stay over often, and his home became hers as well, her toothbrush a welcome guest at his sink, her woolen sweaters interspersed among his own. He would always make sure to buy Coke for her, even though he personally disliked the beverage. But things changed.\n\nHe would always recall the turning point in their relationship. It was a year and a half in, and things were different between them, although they didn't know it yet. He knew that they had many more fights, but that was normal; honeymoons never lasted forever. She came over after class on a Friday, tired from an exam. They had a small argument the day before - he couldn't recall what about - but it was nothing new, nothing they couldn't recover from.\n\nShe put her bag on the ground. \"Hey, do you have any Coke?\" she called to him, standing in the kitchen. He walked over to the fridge, about to grab some for her, when he realized that somehow, he had forgotten to restock for the first time.\n\n\"No, sorry. Is Pepsi okay?\" he said.\n\nYes, he thought, looking back. That was the day.",

But then I discovered it’s got its own charm.”\n\nEmma raised an eyebrow, a playful smile tugging at her lips. “Is Pepsi okay?” she asked, echoing the question in the air. It wasn’t just about the drink; it was about everything they had been tiptoeing around lately.\n\nJake opened the can, the hiss of carbonation punctuating the silence. “Absolutely. It’s okay to have preferences, to choose differently. Sometimes, what’s second-best is just right for you.”\n\nEmma chuckled, leaning back in her chair. “I remember when we were kids, we’d debate all the time about which was better.

Maybe it’s about understanding that sometimes, what’s okay for you might not be okay for me, and that’s perfectly fine.”\n\nThe room fell quiet again, save for the occasional clink of Emma’s coffee spoon against her mug.

They had always been a team, but sometimes being okay with differences meant growing in new directions. \n\nShe smiled, a genuine warmth flooding her face. “Okay. So, Pepsi’s okay with me, and maybe our paths will be okay too, even if they’re not always parallel.”\n\nJake grinned, raising his can in a mock toast. “To Pepsi, and to whatever comes next.”\n\nEmma clinked her mug against the can, the sound a small celebration of acceptance and understanding.

It started one evening when I noticed the way she avoided sunlight, her pale skin glistening under the moonlight streaming through our window. At first, I was shocked, but Lily simply smiled and said, \"I thought you might figure it out eventually.\"\n\n\"I did,\" I admitted, my voice steady despite my racing heart. \"But it doesn't change anything between us, does it?\"\n\nHer eyes sparkled with a mix of relief and gratitude. \"I hope not,\" she replied, nestling closer against me. \"I love you, vampire or not.\"\n\nIn many ways, Lily's vampiric nature added a layer of intrigue to our lives. Our nights were spent strolling under the stars, exploring the city's hidden alleys where she felt most at home. Her senses were heightened, and the world seemed to come alive with a vibrancy that was almost intoxicating.\n\nI found myself fascinated by her world, eager to understand her unique perspective. Lily taught me about the delicate balance of her existence, the careful rituals she followed to coexist with humans. I learned about her ancient lineage and the centuries of history she carried within her.\n\nDespite the eerie nature of her secret, Lily's presence brought a sense of calm and strength. Her vampire side only heightened the qualities I already admired: her intelligence, her unwavering loyalty, and the way she lit up any room with her radiant energy.\n\nWe faced challenges, naturally. There were moments when the world seemed intent on exposing her secret, but we navigated them together. I became her protector, not just out of love, but out of a deep-seated desire to stand by her side, no matter what.\n\nAs time passed, the idea of Lily being different no longer felt like a burden. Instead, it became a testament to the depth of our connection. We embraced the duality of her existence, finding beauty in the ordinary and the extraordinary.\n\nAnd so, our story continued, woven with threads of moonlight and shadow. In the end, it wasn't about a vampire and her human lover; it was about two souls bound by an unbreakable bond, thriving in the spaces where the night met the dawn.",

    "HWT": "Sirta had been born under a bad omen. The clan just did what they always had done and threw her over the threshold. The people under a bad omen were a threat and had been put in that magical area were nothing can escape once it gets in. The village was safe in that area, the child not so much. Sirta was fed (the village were not savages, they used to just starve these people, but these days, they even allowed them to survive) and learned to scavage, she was not spoken to, but she learned speech from hearing the others. When she spoke to them, they told each other how horribly inappropriate she had just been.\n\nShe tried to be useful to the village by waking them when the jackals were about to attack at night, and it even led to a bit of appreciation, until once, she confused a group of housecats with jackals. The vllagers even threw stones at her and insulted her. It was the only imes they talked to her so she became more unpleasant and caused more problems by being loud, rude and angry. I relished the attention I got. For the first time I was a presence, not an absence. That is how they call the area beyond the threshold: the Absence.\n\nThese days, I don't even do this, the stones left me bruised for too long. I just gave up. Even when thy gave me positive attention, I kept to myself and instead tried to define myself as myself, not as the area they threw me in as a child. I walked away from the village. Maybe I was not the first one who was thrown in here.",
    "MGT": "In the heart of a bustling city, there was a small, dimly lit office where I spent countless hours hunched over a cluttered desk. The stack of papers in front of me seemed to grow taller with each passing day, a constant reminder of my greatest struggle: the relentless pursuit of recognition in a field teeming with talent. My name was Emma, and I was a writer whose voice seemed to disappear into the cacophony of the literary world.\n\nEvery morning, I'd arrive at the office before anyone else, the city still cloaked in the soft embrace of dawn. My fingers would fly across the keyboard, weaving tales that danced at the edge of reality and imagination. But despite the hours spent crafting stories, the response was often silence. Rejection letters piled up, each one a dagger to my ambitions, yet they only fueled my determination.\n\nOne particularly gloomy afternoon, as rain pattered against the window, a new challenge emerged. The prestigious Writers' Guild announced a competition with a grand prize that promised to change everything for the winner. The theme was \"The Unseen Struggle,\" a chance to share a story that spoke to the heart of adversity. It was as if fate had handed me a golden ticket, but with it came an insurmountable pressure.\n\nDays turned into nights as I poured my soul onto the pages, writing about a character who, like me, grappled with the shadows of doubt and the hunger for validation. Her journey mirrored my own—a relentless battle against unseen forces, a quest for a voice in a world that seemed indifferent.\n\nThe deadline loomed like a storm on the horizon, and I found myself at a crossroads. Doubt whispered in my ear, questioning whether my stories were enough, whether anyone would ever understand the depths of my struggle. But I pressed on, fueled by the belief that my words held power, even if the world had yet to see it.\n\nFinally, the day of submission arrived. I clicked \"send\" and leaned back, feeling a mixture of relief and apprehension. Days turned into weeks, and the silence was deafening. Then, one crisp morning, an email notification broke the stillness. My heart raced as I opened it—my story was chosen as the winner.\n\nThe news spread like wildfire, and suddenly, my name was no longer just another face in the crowd. I had finally found my voice, and with it, the recognition I had longed for. The struggle was great, but so was the triumph, a testament to the resilience of the human spirit and the power of perseverance.",
