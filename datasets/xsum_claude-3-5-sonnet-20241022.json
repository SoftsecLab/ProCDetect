    "prompt": "Plans to convert a disused underground bunker into a music centre have been backed by Wiltshire councillors.",
    "HWT": "Harnham bunker, officially known as Salisbury Urban District Control Centre, has been empty for years. Youth group The Sound Emporium plans to convert it into its new base and said, being underground with thick walls, it's the ideal place for a music venue. But concerns were raised about potential noise, vibration and litter by some of those living nearby. Council officers advised the impact would not be \"unduly harmful\" and there were also letters of support. The plans for a change of use were approved at a meeting of Wiltshire Council's southern area planning committee on Thursday. Ross Sanderson, of the Sound Emporium, told the BBC the venue was \"unique\" and \"inspiring\". \"What better place to have a music venue than underground, with the natural soundproofing of the earth plus between 5ft-10ft thick concrete walls?\" Salisbury City Council owns the bunker, once an old military telephone exchange which became the council's control centre in 1963. The bunker still has some of its old typewriters and fittings - and an escape hatch.",
    "MGT": "Wiltshire councillors have given their backing to ambitious plans that would transform a disused underground bunker into a state-of-the-art music centre, marking a significant step forward for the innovative cultural project.\n\nThe former military installation, which has remained largely unused for decades, is set to be converted into a modern facility designed to support local musicians and provide community access to professional-grade recording and performance spaces. The unique venue would offer acoustically optimized rooms, rehearsal facilities, and educational programs for aspiring artists of all ages.\n\nLocal councillors praised the project's potential to breathe new life into the historic structure while addressing the region's need for accessible music facilities. The underground location is expected to provide exceptional sound isolation, making it ideal for both recording and live performances without disturbing neighboring areas.\n\nProject organizers emphasized that the conversion would preserve the bunker's historical significance while creating opportunities for emerging talent in the region. The facility aims to serve as both a creative hub and an educational resource, offering workshops, masterclasses, and collaborative spaces for musicians across various genres.\n\nPlanning permission is expected to move forward pending final environmental assessments and funding confirmation. If approved, construction could begin within the next eighteen months, with the music centre potentially opening to the public by late 2026."

    "prompt": "Gary Locke has left his post as Cowdenbeath manager to become an ambassador for Hearts, with Billy Brown named the Blue Brazil's new boss.",
    "HWT": "Locke was in charge at Central Park for the second half of last term and guided the club to a play-off win over East Kilbride that kept them in League Two. Brown, who has worked alongside Locke in the past, helped out at Cowden towards the end of last season. The club say their aim remains to secure promotion next season. Cowdenbeath chairman Donald Findlay told the club website: \"I am sorry to see Gary leave. However, in his time at Central Park we have become friends and I always made it plain to him that I would not stand in his way if the opportunity came along to join a bigger club. \"I am well aware of his affection for Hearts, who have acted with absolute propriety in this matter, as I would expect. I will always be grateful for what he and Billy Brown did for the club at the end of the season and I have every confidence that Billy will carry on the good work.\" Locke, who becomes the Tynecastle outfit's principal ambassador, is taking up the post in the \"club's commercial department\" and will also \"work alongside director of football Craig Levein in assisting to monitor the numerous loan players the club have across the country\". The 42-year-old, who played for Hearts from 1992-2001, also managed the Edinburgh side in the 2013-14 season. Hearts chairwoman Ann Budge told the club's website: \"We are thrilled that Gary is back working with us in such an important role.\"",
    "MGT": "Gary Locke has departed his role as Cowdenbeath manager to take up a new position as ambassador for Hearts, with the League Two club moving quickly to appoint Billy Brown as his replacement.\n\nLocke, who had been in charge of the Blue Brazil since his appointment, leaves Central Park to return to Tynecastle in an ambassadorial capacity with the Edinburgh club where he previously served as manager. The 48-year-old's tenure at Cowdenbeath saw him work to stabilize the club's position in Scotland's fourth tier while developing young talent and implementing his footballing philosophy.\n\nHearts moved swiftly to secure Locke's services in what represents a significant coup for the Gorgie outfit. The ambassador role will see him utilize his extensive knowledge of Scottish football and his connections throughout the game to benefit the club's various initiatives and community programs.\n\nBilly Brown steps into the vacant managerial position at Cowdenbeath with immediate effect. The experienced coach brings a wealth of knowledge to the role, having worked extensively throughout Scottish football in various capacities. Brown faces the challenge of maintaining the momentum built during Locke's time while putting his own stamp on the team's approach.\n\nCowdenbeath chairman expressed confidence in Brown's ability to lead the club forward, citing his coaching credentials and understanding of lower-league football as key factors in his appointment. The transition comes at a crucial time in the season, with the club looking to build on recent performances and push for a stronger league position.\n\nThe move represents an intriguing development for both clubs, with Hearts gaining an experienced football mind in their ambassadorial ranks while Cowdenbeath welcome a new voice to guide their on-field ambitions. Brown is expected to take his first training session this week as he begins preparations for upcoming fixtures."

    "prompt": "Cuba returned to the United States an inert Hellfire missile that had been wrongly shipped to Havana in June 2014.",
    "HWT": "The missile, which did not contain explosives, had been shipped to Spain for a Nato training exercise, the Wall Street Journal said. It was then taken to Germany and eventually to Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris for onward delivery to Florida. It was instead loaded on to an Air France flight to Havana. The incident could have led to a serious loss of military technology, officials told the Wall Street Journal. The whole affair has been embarrassing for the Americans, who have had to ask the Cubans if they could have their highly sensitive missile back, says the BBC's Will Grant in Havana. The missile arrived on a flight from Paris \"by mistake or mishandling in the country of origin,\" said a Cuban Foreign Ministry statement. \"Cuba acted with seriousness and transparency and co-operated to find a satisfactory solution to this issue,\" it added. The AGM 114 Hellfire is a laser-guided missile that can be deployed from an attack helicopter or an unmanned drone. US officials were worried that Cuba could share the advanced technology inside the missile with countries such as North Korea, China or Russia, sources close to the investigation told the Wall Street Journal. The US and Cuba, old Cold War enemies, restored diplomatic relations in July last year after more than 50 years. The two countries have been working to rebuild their economic and trade ties. An announcement is expected on Tuesday about the reinstatement of scores of commercial flights between US cities and Havana.",
    "MGT": "Cuba has returned an inert Hellfire missile to the United States that was mistakenly shipped to Havana in June 2014, marking an unusual diplomatic exchange between the two nations amid their historic rapprochement.\n\nThe missile, manufactured by Lockheed Martin, was supposed to be sent from a NATO training exercise in Spain back to the United States but was instead diverted to the Cuban capital through what officials described as a shipping error. The weapon contained no explosive warhead and posed no immediate security threat.\n\nCuban authorities discovered the misrouted missile and informed U.S. officials of its presence on the island. The return comes as both countries work to normalize relations after decades of Cold War-era hostility, with the Obama administration having recently restored diplomatic ties and eased some economic sanctions.\n\nThe Hellfire missile is typically used by military drones and helicopters for precision strikes. While this particular unit was inert and used for training purposes, its advanced guidance technology raised concerns about potential intelligence value if it had fallen into the wrong hands.\n\nU.S. officials expressed gratitude for Cuba's cooperation in returning the weapon, viewing it as a positive gesture that demonstrates growing trust between the former adversaries. The incident highlighted vulnerabilities in military shipping procedures and prompted reviews of logistics protocols for sensitive equipment.\n\nThe missile's return was facilitated through diplomatic channels, with both governments treating the matter as a routine administrative issue rather than a security crisis. This measured response reflects the broader effort by both nations to move beyond past conflicts and establish a more constructive relationship.\n\nThe successful resolution of this unusual situation represents another small step in the gradual thawing of U.S.-Cuba relations after more than five decades of estrangement."

    "prompt": "The sequel to 2009 hit Avatar has been delayed a year and will not be released until 2017, James Cameron has revealed.",
    "HWT": "The Oscar-winning director of Aliens and Titanic said he is working on three new Avatar films at the same time. The first film was supposed to be out in December 2016, but Cameron said writing the stories had become \"very involved\". \"There's a layer of complexity in getting the story to work as a saga across three films,\" he explained. Cameron said the goal was to have the scripts for the three movies completed by the end of this month so that filming can begin. \"We're writing three simultaneously and we've done that so that everything tracks throughout the three films,\" he told the Associated Press. \"We're not just going to do one and then make up another one and another one after that. \"And parallel with that, we're doing all the design. So we've designed all the creatures and the environments.\" Cameron said he thought it was important that each film linked forward to the next one in a satisfying way, but also came to a resolution that did not leave the audience hanging. The three films will be shot in New Zealand, where some of the original film was also made. Avatar is the highest-grossing film in history, with box office takings of almost $2.8 billion (Â£1.8 billion). Set in the 22nd Century on a distant planet inhabited by a humanoid race, the sci-fi epic went on to win three Oscars. Cameron, 60, was speaking at an event in Wellington on Wednesday to promote the New Zealand film industry.",
    "MGT": "James Cameron has announced that the highly anticipated sequel to his 2009 blockbuster \"Avatar\" will be delayed by a full year, with the release now pushed back to 2017.\n\nThe filmmaker revealed the news during a press event in New Zealand, where pre-production work on the sequel has been underway. The original film, which revolutionized 3D technology and remains the highest-grossing movie of all time with nearly $2.8 billion in worldwide box office, was initially expected to spawn a follow-up much sooner.\n\n\"Making Avatar was a complex process, and the sequels are even more complex,\" Cameron explained. \"The design process is very detailed and time-consuming. We're writing three films simultaneously, and we've had to develop our new software and pipeline at the same time.\"\n\nCameron had previously announced ambitious plans for not just one sequel but three follow-up films to be shot simultaneously. This expanded scope appears to be partly responsible for the delay.\n\n20th Century Fox, the studio behind the franchise, declined to comment specifically on the postponement but released a statement expressing continued confidence in Cameron's vision.\n\nIndustry analysts suggest the delay may actually benefit the franchise in the long run by allowing more time to refine the groundbreaking visual effects that made the original such a phenomenon.\n\nThe original \"Avatar\" transported audiences to the lush alien world of Pandora and told the story of a paraplegic marine who finds himself torn between following orders and protecting the alien world he feels is his true home.\n\nCameron has previously hinted that the sequels will explore Pandora's oceans and other moons in the same star system, while continuing the story of characters Jake Sully and Neytiri.\n\nThe filmmaker remains confident that the wait will be worthwhile: \"When you see what we're creating, I think it will be well worth the delay.\""

    "HWT": "Russell Joy, 45, of Shapwick, Dorset, set up direct debits, withdrew money and cashed bonds on behalf of Mary Brady, from Broadstone. Bournemouth Crown Court heard Joy won the trust of the pensioner, who died earlier this month, when she hired him as her gardener in 2008. He was entrusted to withdraw money for her daily living expenses. In December 2014 he made the first of 107 withdrawals without her knowledge, totalling £32,100. The following November Ms Brady cashed five bonds in the sum of £230,000 and wrote Joy a cheque for £100,000. In March 2016, he received a further £20,000 cheque. He also withdrew money to buy a Land Rover car and set up a direct debit to pay his vehicle insurance. The offences came to light when the pensioner's relatives checked her finances while she was in hospital. In a statement, Ms Brady's family said they were \"desperately sad\" about the \"ugly end\" to her life. Det Insp Andy Dilworth said: \"Russell Joy is nothing more than a callous fraudster.

The court heard how he gained her confidence through what appeared to be genuine friendship, only to abuse that relationship for financial gain.\n\nThe victim, who trusted the man implicitly, was left devastated both financially and emotionally by his betrayal. The fraud involved sophisticated manipulation tactics designed to exploit her vulnerability and advanced age.\n\nProsecutors outlined how the defendant carefully orchestrated his scheme, gradually gaining access to the woman's finances while maintaining the facade of friendship. The substantial sum stolen represented a significant portion of the victim's life savings, accumulated over decades of careful financial management.\n\nDuring sentencing, the judge condemned the defendant's actions as particularly heinous given the victim's age and vulnerability. The court emphasized that crimes targeting elderly members of society would be met with severe punishment.\n\nThe case highlights the ongoing problem of financial abuse against elderly individuals, with authorities urging families and communities to remain vigilant for signs of exploitation. Social services and financial institutions have implemented additional safeguards to protect vulnerable adults from such predatory behavior.\n\nThe defendant showed little remorse throughout the proceedings, further aggravating his sentence.

    "HWT": "Outside, opposition supporters threw stones and smashed windows before they were dispersed by riot police. Protesters have been trying to disrupt parliament over an EU-brokered deal to improve relations with Serbia. Kosovo unilaterally declared its independence from Serbia in 2008. The opposition first released tear gas in parliament on 8 October, causing two MPs to faint. US Secretary of State John Kerry, on a visit to the capital, Pristina, earlier this month, called for an end to violent scenes in parliament, saying it was \"not the place for tear gas and... not the place for intimidation\". However, opposition MPs released gas canisters again in the parliamentary chamber on Monday, forcing a suspension of proceedings. A large group of plainclothes police officers donned gas masks as the chamber was cleared. One of the MPs who released the gas, Glauk Konjufca, said it was \"a collective action by the opposition\". \"Others have done this too, and we will continue to do this in the future. Our breaching of the law is nothing compared to the damage that is being done by these agreements.\" The opposition is particularly opposed to a deal to give more autonomy to Kosovo's ethnic Serb minority, which they say could increase Serbia's influence. The vote on next year's €1.67bn (£1.1bn) budget resumed in a side room, with only MPs from the governing coalition present and was approved, Reuters news agency reported. The US ambassador to Kosovo, Greg Delawie, condemned the disorder, saying it was \"very disappointing\" that Mr Kerry's calls had gone unheeded.",
    "MGT": "Opposition lawmakers in Kosovo's parliament deployed tear gas canisters during a legislative session on Thursday, marking the sixth such incident in just over two months as political tensions continue to escalate in the Balkan nation. The disruptive protest forced the suspension of a crucial vote on the government's proposed 2016 budget.\n\nThe tear gas release sent lawmakers, government officials, and parliamentary staff scrambling from the chamber as the acrid smoke filled the room. Security personnel quickly evacuated the building while emergency crews worked to clear the air. The session was immediately suspended, with no indication of when proceedings might resume.\n\nOpposition parties have been staging increasingly dramatic protests against the government's policies, particularly objecting to agreements reached with neighboring Serbia and Montenegro. The repeated use of tear gas has become a signature tactic of the opposition, which argues that the ruling coalition has betrayed Kosovo's national interests through various diplomatic concessions.\n\nPrime Minister Isa Mustafa's government has condemned the disruptive tactics, calling them undemocratic and harmful to Kosovo's international reputation. Government supporters argue that the opposition is preventing legitimate governance and blocking important legislation that would benefit Kosovo's citizens.\n\nThe stalled budget vote represents a significant obstacle for the government, which needs parliamentary approval to implement its spending plans for the coming year. The proposed budget includes provisions for infrastructure development, social programs, and economic initiatives designed to address Kosovo's high unemployment rate and economic challenges.\n\nInternational observers have expressed concern about the ongoing political crisis, warning that the instability could harm Kosovo's European integration aspirations. The European Union has called for dialogue between political parties to resolve their differences through democratic means rather than disruptive protests.\n\nKosovo declared independence from Serbia in 2008 and has been working to establish stable democratic institutions while pursuing international recognition and European Union membership."

    "prompt": "Manufacturing sales from Northern Ireland were worth £13.3bn last year, the highest value on record.",
    "HWT": "External sales were up by 3.2% over the year, a rise of £415m. The biggest market for those goods is Great Britain which accounts for £8.1bn - just under half the total value. The Republic of Ireland is the next single biggest market at £1.3bn, followed by the rest of the EU at £1.2bn. Sales to all other parts of the world were £2.6bn. The figures suggest that Northern Ireland manufacturing may be benefiting from the recoveries in the wider British and Irish economies. Sales to GB were up by 6.2% while sales to the Republic of Ireland were up by 5.3%. However sales to other EU countries fell by 13%. The figures are produced by the  Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency (NISRA). Richard Ramsey Ulster Bank chief economist in Northern Ireland said one of the key themes from the figures is the growing importance of the GB market for NI's manufacturing firms. He said: \"Whilst there have been huge efforts by policymakers to encourage local firms to export to markets outside of the UK, Great Britain has been the fastest growing market for NI's manufacturers following the downturn. \"Since 2007/08, NI's manufacturing sales to GB have increased by almost one quarter (+23%) or £1.5bn. \"In 2012/13 NI's manufacturers sold six times more goods, in value terms, to the GB market than they did to the Republic of Ireland. \"Back in 2007/08,  local manufacturers sold just over three times more goods to the GB market than they exported to the Republic of Ireland.\"",
    "MGT": "Manufacturing sales from Northern Ireland reached a record-breaking £13.3 billion last year, marking the highest value ever recorded for the region's industrial sector. The milestone figure represents a significant achievement for Northern Ireland's economy and underscores the growing strength of its manufacturing base.\n\nThe record-breaking performance reflects the resilience and adaptability of Northern Ireland's manufacturing companies, which have successfully navigated challenging global economic conditions while continuing to expand their operations and market reach. Industries across the region contributed to this historic total, demonstrating the diverse nature of Northern Ireland's manufacturing landscape.\n\nLocal manufacturing businesses have benefited from strategic investments in technology, infrastructure, and workforce development over recent years. These improvements have enhanced productivity levels and enabled companies to compete more effectively in both domestic and international markets. The sector's success has also been supported by favorable business conditions and government initiatives designed to promote industrial growth.\n\nThe achievement comes at a time when manufacturing sectors worldwide have faced numerous pressures, including supply chain disruptions, rising material costs, and shifting consumer demands. Northern Ireland's ability to achieve record sales despite these challenges highlights the sector's fundamental strength and the effectiveness of local business strategies.\n\nManufacturing remains a cornerstone of Northern Ireland's economy, providing thousands of jobs across the region and contributing substantially to overall economic output. The sector encompasses a wide range of industries, from traditional manufacturing to advanced technology production, each playing a vital role in the region's economic ecosystem.\n\nIndustry leaders have expressed optimism about future prospects, citing ongoing investments in innovation and technology as key drivers for continued growth.

It is updating its National Flood Risk Assessment which informs members of the public and local authorities about the likelihood of flooding. The Environment Agency grades coastal areas at risk of flooding from very low to high. Environment Agency flood risks: High: Greater than one in 30 chance in any given year Medium: One in 30 to one in 200 chance in any given year Low: One in 200 to one in 1000 chance in any given year Very low: Less than one in 1,000 chance in any given year Last winter massive storms hit the South West coast with waves up to 15m (50ft) high, destroying part of the main railway line out of the region at Dawlish. Marcus Salmon, planning liaison technical specialist with the agency, said: \"The storms have definitely reflected areas where our maps are not as representative as they can be. \"That is something that we are working to address as quickly as possible. \"Last winter's storms showed the susceptibility of our coastal communities and infrastructure to flooding and erosion. \"The challenges presented by flooding and coastal erosion are expected to become more acute as a result of climate change, due to a combination of sea level rise, increased storminess and increased wave heights. \"So as to better understand the risks we are updating the National Flood Risk Assessment to take account of wave, wind and storm surge which are underrepresented in our current mapping.\"",

Officials say the review comes amid growing evidence that coastal flooding events are becoming more frequent and severe.\n\n\"We are seeing changes in wave patterns and storm intensity that require us to reassess our understanding of coastal flood risk,\" said a spokesperson for the Environment Agency. \"This review will help us better protect communities and ensure our flood defenses are fit for purpose.\"\n\nThe study will particularly focus on areas where high waves combined with spring tides and storm conditions could overwhelm existing sea defenses. Coastal regions in the southwest, east coast, and areas around major estuaries are expected to receive priority attention.\n\nClimate scientists have noted that rising sea levels, coupled with more intense weather systems, are creating conditions where traditionally safe coastal areas may face unprecedented flooding risks. The review will incorporate the latest climate projections and wave modeling technology to assess future threats.\n\nLocal authorities along the coast have welcomed the initiative, with many reporting increased incidents of wave overtopping and coastal erosion in recent years. The findings will inform future investment in coastal defenses and help guide planning decisions for new developments in at-risk areas.\n\nThe Environment Agency expects to complete the initial phase of the review within the next twelve months, with detailed recommendations for enhanced flood protection measures to follow. Communities identified as facing elevated risks will be prioritized for defense upgrades and emergency preparedness improvements.\n\nThe review represents one of the most comprehensive assessments of England's coastal flood vulnerability undertaken in recent years."

In a previous statement (in German), the court detailed allegations of Shaas al-M's involvement in IS operations in Syria, including participating in the siege of the airport at Deir al-Zour, handling a Kalashnikov gun and helping supply fighters with food. Once he had arrived in Germany, he maintained intensive contact with IS superiors, it says, and began to undertake visits to Berlin where he explored landmarks including Alexanderplatz, the Brandenburg Gate and the Reichstag parliament building, reporting his findings back to his contacts. He is also accused of arranging for at least one person to travel to Syria to fight, and offering his services to assist would-be attackers travelling to Germany. The court has scheduled some 25 hearings to run until April.",
    "MGT": "A 21-year-old Syrian man appeared before a German court this week, facing charges of reconnaissance activities for the Islamic State terrorist organization in Berlin. The defendant, whose identity has not been publicly disclosed due to German privacy laws, is accused of conducting surveillance operations to identify potential targets for future attacks in the German capital.\n\nAccording to prosecutors, the man allegedly arrived in Germany as part of a broader IS strategy to infiltrate European countries and establish operational cells. Court documents suggest he was specifically tasked with gathering intelligence on crowded public spaces, transportation hubs, and government buildings throughout Berlin between 2023 and early 2024.\n\nThe case represents one of several recent prosecutions in Germany related to IS activities, highlighting ongoing security concerns about sleeper cells and radicalized individuals operating within European borders. German authorities have been particularly vigilant following previous terrorist incidents across Europe that were linked to Islamic State operatives.\n\nDuring the opening proceedings, federal prosecutors outlined their evidence, which reportedly includes digital communications and surveillance footage placing the defendant at various sensitive locations throughout the city. Investigators claim they discovered detailed notes and photographs on his electronic devices that corresponded with typical reconnaissance patterns used by terrorist organizations.\n\nThe defendant's legal team has indicated they will challenge the charges, arguing that their client's presence at various locations was coincidental rather than part of any coordinated intelligence-gathering operation. They maintain that the evidence is circumstantial and does not definitively prove intent to facilitate terrorist activities.\n\nGerman security services worked closely with international partners to build the case, utilizing intelligence-sharing agreements that have become increasingly important in combating transnational terrorism. The investigation reportedly began following tips from foreign intelligence agencies about suspicious activities involving Syrian nationals in major European cities.\n\nIf convicted, the defendant faces up to ten years in prison under Germany's strict anti-terrorism legislation. The trial is expected to continue for several weeks, with prosecutors calling numerous witnesses including security experts and intelligence officials.\n\nThe case underscores Germany's ongoing efforts to balance humanitarian obligations toward refugees with national security concerns, as authorities work to identify and prosecute individuals who may exploit migration systems for terrorist purposes."

    "HWT": "Anne Thomas, of Linc Care, made the comments in light of Welsh government plans published on Tuesday to strengthen care homes regulations. A new law will make care home owners more accountable for their services. Health Minister Mark Drakeford said lessons had been learned from previous care sector scandals. These include the collapsed Operation Jasmine, the UK's biggest investigation into alleged neglect at nursing homes in south Wales, which was carried out by Gwent Police. The operation ended after the owner of some of the care homes concerned, Dr Prana Das, suffered a brain injury and could not stand trial. Ms Thomas said: \"The level of acuity and dependency in nursing homes has changed dramatically over the past few years and the current regulation really looks at the wrong things and so it's great to have something that looks at the kind of evidence that we need to provide [to show] that we're looking after people well.\" According to the Welsh government, the Regulation of Social Care Bill will: Health Minister Mark Drakeford said: \"We have learned lessons from Southern Cross, Mid Staffs, Winterbourne Operation Jasmine and other scandals where people being cared for were badly let down by services.\"",

The current framework, they claimed, focuses too heavily on paperwork and administrative compliance rather than evaluating actual care outcomes and resident wellbeing.\n\n\"We're spending enormous amounts of time and resources preparing for inspections that don't truly measure what matters most - the quality of life and care our residents receive,\" the director stated. They emphasized that the inspection process has become increasingly bureaucratic, creating additional burdens for care providers without meaningful improvements to care standards.\n\nThe director called for a complete overhaul of the inspection methodology, suggesting that future assessments should prioritize direct observation of care practices, resident satisfaction, and staff competency over documentation reviews. They proposed that inspectors should spend more time engaging with residents and families to understand their experiences firsthand.\n\nThis criticism comes amid ongoing challenges facing Wales' social care sector, including staff shortages, funding pressures, and increasing demand for services. The director's comments reflect growing frustration within the industry about regulatory processes that many feel are disconnected from the realities of modern care provision.\n\nIndustry leaders are now calling for urgent dialogue with regulatory bodies to develop more effective inspection frameworks."

    "prompt": "Japan's authorities have seized the passport of a journalist planning to travel to Syria, local media say.",
    "HWT": "It was necessary to confiscate Yuichi Sugimoto's passport in order to protect his life, the authorities said. The 59-year-old photographer, who had planned to enter Syria on 27 February, described the move as a threat to the freedom of press. Two Japanese hostages were killed by Islamic State (IS) militants in Syria in January. However, Mr Sugimoto told reporters that he had no intention to visit areas controlled by IS. It is said to be the first time the Japanese government has taken such a step. The foreign ministry says it is in accordance with a provision in the country's passport law, that allows a confiscation in order to protect the passport holder's life. Mr Sugimoto, who has covered conflict zones in Iraq and Syria before, insists he has always taken precautions and retreated when in danger. \"What happens to my freedom to travel and freedom of the press?\" he told the Japanese paper Asahi Shimbun. He said he was planning to travel to Turkey before entering Syria with a former soldier who had previously worked for Kenji Goto, a fellow journalist who was taken hostage, and killed in Syria last month. A second Japanese citizen, Haruna Yukawa, was also kidnapped and killed by IS militants. After the handling of the hostage crisis, approval ratings for the government of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe have gone up, recent polls show. Two separate surveys conducted by the Yomiuri newspaper and Japan's news agency Kyodo indicate that up to 60% of people approve of the way the government dealt with the crisis. A similar percentage also said Japan's support to countries affected IS should continue to be non-military. In January, Mr Abe promised $200m (Â£130m) in non-military aid for countries fighting Islamic State. Officials said that much of the $200m fund would be focused on helping refugees displaced from Syria and Iraq.",
    "MGT": "Japanese authorities have confiscated the passport of a journalist who was planning to travel to Syria, according to local media reports. The move represents the latest action by the Japanese government to prevent its citizens from entering the war-torn Middle Eastern nation.\n\nThe journalist, whose identity has not been publicly disclosed, had their travel document seized under Japan's revised passport law, which grants authorities the power to revoke or refuse to issue passports when travel could potentially endanger national security or public safety. The legislation was strengthened following several high-profile incidents involving Japanese nationals in conflict zones.\n\nJapan's Foreign Ministry has maintained a strict travel advisory against all travel to Syria since the country's civil war began in 2011. The ongoing conflict has created one of the world's worst humanitarian crises, with hundreds of thousands of deaths and millions of people displaced from their homes.\n\nThe passport seizure comes amid heightened concerns about the safety of journalists and other civilians in Syria. The country remains extremely dangerous for foreign correspondents, with numerous cases of kidnapping, detention, and violence against media personnel documented throughout the conflict.\n\nJapanese officials have cited the unpredictable security situation in Syria as justification for preventing citizens from traveling there. The government has expressed particular concern about the presence of various armed groups and the risk of Japanese nationals being taken hostage or caught in crossfire between warring parties.\n\nThis incident reflects Japan's broader approach to protecting its citizens abroad, particularly in regions affected by armed conflict or terrorism. The government has previously taken similar measures to prevent travel to other high-risk areas, including parts of Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\nThe journalist's legal representatives have not yet announced whether they plan to challenge the passport confiscation in court. Under Japanese law, individuals whose passports are seized have the right to appeal such decisions through the judicial system.\n\nMedia freedom advocates have raised questions about the balance between citizen safety and press freedom, arguing that journalists should be able to make informed decisions about the risks they are willing to take in pursuit of their professional duties. However, government officials maintain that the primary responsibility is protecting Japanese lives in dangerous international situations."

    "HWT": "Glasgow's Bennett, 23 on Wednesday, was due to resume contact work on Monday after suffering a shoulder injury against Racing 92 three weeks ago. \"It's his first day in terms of contact, so he's back in the mix,\" said Scotland assistant coach Matt Taylor. \"I think he has a good chance but he'll have to put his best foot forward.\" Bennett has scored six tries in 13 Tests and was one of the stand-out performers in Scotland's World Cup campaign last autumn. With fellow Glasgow centres Alex Dunbar, Peter Horne and Richie Vernon all ruled out of at least the start of the Six Nations - or in Vernon's case, the entire Championship - Bennett's possible availability would be a major boost. \"A fully-fit Bennett is a very good player,\" Taylor noted. \"There is a reason he played so well in the World Cup, so it is great he is back in the mix.\" Scotland wing Sean Maitland has also been declared fully fit after coming through a full game for London Irish on the weekend. But Harlequins wing Tim Visser is still a \"couple of weeks off\" and unlikely to be available before Scotland's third Six Nations match against Italy in Rome. With Matt Scott likely to start at inside centre, Bennett is competing with Saracens' Duncan Taylor for the number 13 jersey against England. The in-form Taylor has been a vital source of intelligence on England's likely defensive set-up, with new Red Rose assistant coach Paul Gustard set to bring his famed 'wolf-pack' approach from Saracens into the national squad. \"I think Duncan is caught between a rock and a hard place,\" grinned Taylor. \"He feels like he has been giving out all this information on how Saracens, and now England, are defending. That is hard when there are other guys in our group from the likes of Gloucester and Bath who can benefit. \"But that is international rugby. We have been talking about how they defend and Duncan gives us an insight into what to expect. But we will be trying to concentrate on what we do.\"",
    "MGT": "Scotland centre Mark Bennett has returned to training and is in contention for Saturday's Six Nations opener against England at Murrayfield, giving head coach Gregor Townsend a welcome boost ahead of the championship's curtain-raiser.\n\nBennett, who has been sidelined with injury concerns in recent weeks, rejoined full training sessions with the squad and according to team sources has a \"good chance\" of featuring in what promises to be a fiercely contested Calcutta Cup encounter.\n\nThe 31-year-old's potential return comes at a crucial time for Scotland, who will be looking to build on their impressive recent form in the tournament. Bennett's experience and ball-handling skills in the midfield could prove invaluable against an England side that will arrive in Edinburgh with their own ambitions of making a strong start to the championship.\n\nScotland's medical team has been carefully monitoring Bennett's progress throughout his rehabilitation, and his return to full contact training this week has exceeded expectations. The centre's ability to create attacking opportunities and his defensive solidity have made him a key component of Townsend's game plan.\n\nThe potential inclusion of Bennett adds another dimension to Scotland's backline options, with the coaching staff now facing some positive selection headaches as they finalize their squad for Saturday's clash. His partnership with fellow centre Sione Tuipulotu has proven effective in previous outings, and their combination could be crucial in breaking down England's defensive line.\n\nScotland will be eager to make a statement in front of their home crowd at Murrayfield, where the atmosphere is expected to be electric for the opening weekend of the Six Nations. The return of Bennett, assuming he passes final fitness tests, provides Townsend with experienced leadership in what could be a pivotal campaign for Scottish rugby.\n\nEngland, meanwhile, will be well aware of the threat Bennett poses when fully fit. His ability to offload in contact and create space for Scotland's dangerous back three has troubled opposing defenses throughout his international career.\n\nThe final team announcement is expected later this week, but Bennett's progress in training has been encouraging for both player and coaching staff. His potential availability adds depth to Scotland's midfield resources and gives them greater tactical flexibility against Steve Borthwick's England side.\n\nWith the championship set to begin in dramatic fashion at Murrayfield, Bennett's return to fitness could not have been better timed for Scotland's hopes of launching their Six Nations campaign with a memorable victory over their oldest rivals."

    "HWT": "Maria Pridmore, 36, was jailed for three years in August after she admitted a string of frauds. They included obtaining more than £16,000 in housing benefit, council tax benefit and income support. Pridmore, who was described in court as a \"Walter Mitty\" fraudster, also stole over £30,000 from four women. She appeared by video-link at Lincoln Crown Court from Drake Hall prison in Staffordshire where she is serving her sentence. The court heard Pridmore, a former drug addict, benefitted by £56,679 from her crimes but had no available assets which could be confiscated to pay back her victims. Judge Simon Hirst ruled that in the circumstances a nominal sum of £1 should be paid. Pridmore made news in 2012 when she gave birth to a daughter after previously suffering 14 miscarriages, a stillbirth and the death of an infant son. At her sentence hearing, the court heard the former nurse had been claiming to be a lone-parent with dependent children in order to get benefits, but at various times failed to declare she had moved or was living with her then partner as man and wife. Pridmore also pocketed more than £30,000 from friends and two elderly women, and used the bank details of one of her victims to pay for a £60 taxi fare to attend a court hearing. She stole almost £8,000 from one victim, an 84-year-old vulnerable woman. Pridmore, of Angel Lane, Holbeach, Lincolnshire, previously admitted seven charges of benefit fraud between August 2010 and March 2013, 19 charges of fraud and theft between January 2013 and May 2016 and stealing her father's flat-packed kitchen in April 2015.",
    "MGT": "A woman who defrauded the benefits system of more than £50,000 while simultaneously targeting vulnerable individuals has been ordered to repay just £1 in what authorities describe as a token confiscation order.\n\nThe case, which highlights ongoing concerns about benefit fraud enforcement, saw the defendant exploit multiple welfare schemes over an extended period. Court documents reveal she systematically claimed benefits to which she was not entitled, accumulating tens of thousands of pounds in fraudulent payments.\n\nBeyond the benefits fraud, the woman also engaged in predatory behavior toward vulnerable members of the community. Prosecutors outlined how she deliberately targeted individuals who were less able to protect themselves, exploiting their circumstances for financial gain.\n\nThe investigation into her activities spanned several months, with authorities uncovering evidence of deliberate deception across multiple benefit categories. Officials worked closely with various agencies to build a comprehensive case that detailed the extent of her fraudulent activities.\n\nDuring sentencing proceedings, the court heard details of the financial impact on public resources and the personal harm caused to her victims. The prosecution emphasized the calculated nature of her crimes and the breach of trust involved in both the benefits fraud and her treatment of vulnerable individuals.\n\nThe confiscation order of £1 reflects the court's assessment of the defendant's available assets and ability to repay the stolen funds. Such nominal orders are typically made when defendants have no recoverable assets, though authorities retain the right to pursue further recovery if circumstances change.\n\nLegal experts note that while the repayment amount appears disproportionate to the crime's scale, confiscation proceedings are governed by strict rules about what assets can be recovered. The case serves as a reminder of the challenges faced in recovering funds from benefit fraud cases.\n\nThe defendant's sentencing marks the conclusion of a complex investigation that required coordination between multiple government departments and agencies to bring the case to court."

This bifurcation has created parallel media ecosystems that often present contrasting perspectives on domestic and international events.\n\nLatvian-language outlets typically emphasize European integration, NATO membership, and democratic values, reflecting the majority population's post-Soviet aspirations. These publications frequently highlight Latvia's progress in distancing itself from Russian influence while strengthening ties with Western institutions.\n\nIn contrast, Russian-language media in Latvia often maintains closer editorial alignment with Moscow's narratives, particularly regarding regional security issues and historical interpretations of Soviet-era events. This creates significant disparities in how major news stories are framed and presented to different audiences within the same country.\n\nThe divide extends beyond language preferences to fundamental worldview differences. Russian-speaking residents, comprising roughly one-quarter of Latvia's population, frequently consume media that portrays Western policies more critically while viewing Russia's actions with greater sympathy.\n\nThis media fragmentation poses challenges for national unity and democratic discourse, as citizens increasingly inhabit separate information environments.

The authority is looking at increasing council tax by 3.7% and making cuts of £17m. Costs for burials as well as births, deaths and marriage registration and school meals could all rise in 2017-18. Along with the proposed cuts, £1.5m from reserves, £1.9m from school budgets and £4.4m from the planned increased in council tax would help make up the shortfall. The cuts are smaller than 2015-16, when £32m in savings was proposed, and 2016-17, when the shortfall was £45m. Proposals include: Cardiff council saw its Welsh Government grant rise by 0.3% to £428m. The overall budget for 2017-18 is £578m. Mr Hinchey, cabinet member for corporate services and performance, said: \"The provisional settlement from Welsh Government is slightly more favourable than we bargained for. \"However, it is still a cut in real terms because of price and pay inflation.\" The council is asking residents to share their views on the proposals in a consultation, which runs from 10 November to 11 December.",

The deficit represents one of the most serious financial challenges the council has faced in recent years.\n\nCouncil officials are now reviewing all services and departments to identify potential savings and cost-cutting measures. This could potentially impact a wide range of municipal services, from social care and education to parks maintenance and refuse collection.\n\nThe financial shortfall comes amid broader economic pressures affecting local authorities across Wales and the rest of the UK. Rising inflation, increased demand for social services, and reduced government funding have combined to create a perfect storm for council finances nationwide.\n\nCardiff's leadership is expected to present detailed proposals for addressing the budget gap in the coming weeks. These may include service reductions, efficiency improvements, or potential increases to council tax rates.\n\nThe council emphasized it remains committed to protecting essential services while exploring innovative solutions to maintain financial stability.

    "HWT": "Mr Hammarskjold died in a plane crash in what is now Zambia in 1961, but the cause of the crash has been disputed. There have been claims that the plane was shot down, but a previous UN enquiry did not reach a definitive conclusion. The Swedish diplomat was on his way to negotiate a ceasefire in the breakaway Congolese state of Katanga. He was trying to mediate between Congo's Soviet-backed government and Moise Tshombe, who had declared independence for the mineral-rich province of Katanga. He was flying to Ndola, in what was then Northern Rhodesia, to meet Mr Tshombe, who was backed by former colonial power Belgium and some Western mining interests. The UN set up this new enquiry after a group of independent investigators said that there was significant new evidence concerning Hammarskjold's death. They said the evidence was \"persuasive\" that \"the aircraft was subjected to some form of attack\". The commission said that the US National Security Agency (NSA) might hold crucial evidence. It said that given the NSA's worldwide monitoring activities at that time, \"it is highly likely\" that the radio traffic on 18-19 September 1961 was recorded by the NSA and possibly also by the CIA. The report said: \"Authenticated recordings of any such cockpit narrative or radio messages, if located, would furnish potentially conclusive evidence of what happened.\" The UN panel will now assess this new information and report back by the end of June.",
    "MGT": "A United Nations inquiry into the mysterious death of former Secretary-General Dag Hammarskjöld is set to commence, marking a significant step toward uncovering the truth behind one of the organization's most enduring mysteries.\n\nHammarskjöld died in a plane crash in Northern Rhodesia, now Zambia, on September 18, 1961, while on a peace mission to end the secession of Katanga province in the Congo. The Swedish diplomat and Nobel Peace Prize laureate was traveling to meet Katangan leader Moise Tshombe when his aircraft went down near Ndola, killing all 16 people aboard.\n\nFor decades, questions have surrounded the circumstances of the crash. While initial investigations concluded it was an accident caused by pilot error, subsequent evidence has raised suspicions of foul play. Witnesses reported seeing another aircraft in the area, and some accounts suggested the plane was shot down or sabotaged.\n\nThe upcoming inquiry will examine previously classified documents and testimonies that have emerged over the years. Intelligence files from various countries, including Belgium, Britain, and the United States, are expected to be reviewed as part of the comprehensive investigation.\n\nHammarskjöld's death occurred during a particularly volatile period in the Congo crisis, with multiple international interests at stake. The region's vast mineral resources and Cold War tensions created a complex web of political and economic motivations that investigators believe may have contributed to his death.\n\nThe UN inquiry represents the most thorough examination of the case to date, with access to materials that were previously unavailable to investigators. Family members of victims and international observers have long advocated for a full investigation into what many consider one of the most significant unsolved mysteries in UN history.\n\nThe findings could potentially reshape understanding of this pivotal moment in international diplomacy and African decolonization."

Assistant coroner Johanna Thompson, at Norfolk Coroner's Court, said they died from gunshot wounds to the head. At the hearings in Norwich, she said she requested forensic officers to identify their bodies by using DNA evidence.

Vandals scrawled their names on top of the artworks in French and Arabic. The Ennedi plateau was declared a Unesco world heritage site in 2016. \"It's an African story and they wanted to destroy that. \"That's why I'm talking about a tragedy, because it's a part of us,\" said Mr Haroun, who is also an award-winning filmmaker. Local youths are suspected of being behind the vandalism. A team has now been sent to the site in north-eastern Chad to assess the damage, with a view to sending experts to follow up. The head of the UN's cultural body in the country, Abdelkerim Adoum Bahar, told the BBC that he thought the damage could be repaired. Thousands of images of people and animals have been painted and carved into the rock surface of caves, canyons and shelters in the area, according to UN cultural agency Unesco. Mr Haroun stressed the historical importance of the site, which he said belonged not just to Chad but to the whole world. \"This is a part of our memory. It helps us to understand who we are...

The site contains some of the most significant examples of ancient human artistic expression in Africa, with paintings depicting wildlife, hunting scenes, and daily life from civilizations that inhabited the region when the Sahara was green and fertile.\n\nChad's Minister of Culture expressed outrage over the vandalism, describing it as an irreparable loss to humanity's cultural heritage. The graffiti was carved directly over delicate cave paintings that archaeologists believe date back several millennia, permanently altering artwork that had survived natural erosion and environmental changes for thousands of years.\n\nThe Ennedi Massif attracts researchers and tourists from around the world due to its unique geological formations and invaluable archaeological treasures. The site's rock art provides crucial insights into prehistoric African societies, climate changes, and the evolution of artistic techniques across different periods.\n\nAuthorities are investigating the incident and considering enhanced security measures to protect the remaining artwork. The vandalism highlights ongoing challenges faced by heritage sites in remote locations, where monitoring and protection are difficult to maintain consistently.\n\nUNESCO officials have not yet responded to requests for comment about potential interventions or support for restoration efforts.

    "HWT": "They accuse Sushila Karki of delivering biased verdicts and interfering in the executive's jurisdiction. At least 249 MPs signed the motion, well over the quarter required to open an impeachment investigation. It comes after the Supreme Court overturned the government's choice of chief of police. Last month the court ruled in favour of a claim by Navaraj Silwal, the most senior officer in the ranks, that he had been unfairly bypassed in favour of a less senior colleague, Jaya Bahadur Chand.

Nepalese media reports say there had been disagreement within the coalition over the appointment. Ms Karki, the head of the Supreme Court, is now automatically suspended from her duties while an impeachment committee is formed and carries out an investigation. The conclusion will then be put to a parliamentary vote, with a two-thirds majority required.

The impeachment motion, supported by the Nepali Congress and the Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist-Leninist), cited concerns about judicial overreach and questioned several controversial decisions made during her tenure.\n\nThe suspension comes amid growing tensions between Nepal's judiciary and executive branches, with critics arguing that recent court rulings have disrupted the democratic process. Opposition parties and civil society groups have raised concerns about the politicization of the impeachment process, warning that it could undermine judicial independence.\n\nRana, who made history as Nepal's first woman to hold the position of chief justice, has defended her actions as necessary to uphold constitutional principles. Her supporters argue that the impeachment represents an attack on judicial autonomy and gender equality in Nepal's male-dominated political landscape.\n\nThe impeachment process requires a two-thirds majority in parliament to succeed, with hearings expected to begin in the coming weeks. Legal experts suggest the proceedings could take months to resolve, creating uncertainty in Nepal's already fragile political environment.\n\nThis development highlights the ongoing institutional challenges facing Nepal's democracy, which has struggled with political instability since the end of its decade-long civil war in 2006.

    "HWT": "The new buzzwords are to be \"outcomes\" and \"indicators\". They are words most people living in Scotland or Finland will be very familiar with. Because Stormont's administrators have been studying what happens in those countries and they like what they see. Scotland has a series of sixteen National Outcomes which describe what the Government there wants to do over the next ten years. This so-called outcomes based approach to government focuses on actual results achieved. The theory is it allows the government and wider public sector to focus on making sustainable improvements to public services and the quality of life for people in Scotland. A series of indicators allow them to track progress towards the achievements of these outcomes. Sources close to the negotiations for a programme for government at Stormont say this is the model they intend to follow. One source said it is about \"doing things differently\" and denied the change was merely cosmetic. As a first step a \"framework\" programme for government will be produced in just over a fortnight. It will then go out to consultation. At the end of this year it will be replaced with a detailed programme for government. There will also be a budget, not for one year but for the next three to four years. And there will be documents setting out strategies on the economy, capital investment and social policy strategy. Sources say this is not a programme for one Assembly mandate but for a 10 - 15 year period. They say it will also require the civil service to be \"more outward facing.\" Politically, this seems the model Sinn FÃ©in and the DUP intend to move forward with - with or without the other parties. Can the SDLP, Ulster Unionists and Alliance agree to go into the next Executive on the basis of a \"framework\"  programme knowing they won't get the real detail for another seven months?",
    "MGT": "Stormont's system of government is preparing for significant changes as political leaders signal their intention to overhaul Northern Ireland's power-sharing arrangements. The proposed reforms aim to address long-standing concerns about the effectiveness and stability of the devolved administration.\n\nThe current system, established under the Good Friday Agreement, has faced criticism for its susceptibility to collapse during periods of political disagreement. Since 1998, the Northern Ireland Assembly has experienced multiple suspensions, leaving the region without local government for extended periods and forcing direct rule from Westminster.\n\nPolitical parties across the spectrum have acknowledged the need for reform, though they differ on the specific changes required. The Democratic Unionist Party has called for modifications to the petition of concern mechanism, which allows parties to block legislation they consider harmful to their community's interests. Meanwhile, Sinn Féin has emphasized the importance of maintaining safeguards that protect nationalist interests within any reformed system.\n\nThe Social Democratic and Labour Party and the Ulster Unionist Party have both advocated for measures that would prevent the complete collapse of government when individual parties withdraw from the Executive. They propose allowing the Assembly to continue functioning even when not all parties participate in the power-sharing arrangements.\n\nAlliance Party representatives have pushed for more fundamental changes, including reforms to the d'Hondt system used to allocate ministerial positions and the introduction of an official opposition. They argue that the current mandatory coalition model stifles effective governance and accountability.\n\nThe proposed makeover comes at a crucial time for Northern Ireland, as the region faces significant challenges including healthcare pressures, economic uncertainty, and ongoing Brexit-related issues. Local politicians recognize that a more stable and effective system of government is essential for addressing these problems.\n\nSecretary of State for Northern Ireland has indicated that the UK government would support reforms that maintain the principles of the Good Friday Agreement while improving governmental effectiveness. However, any changes would require broad consensus among the main political parties and potentially formal amendments to existing legislation.\n\nThe reform process is expected to involve extensive consultations with political parties, civil society groups, and the public.

    "HWT": "When the law comes into effect on 1 January, the Golden State will become the first to outlaw the practice for people under the age of 18. The bill was backed by mental health groups, and gay rights activists say reparative or \"conversion therapy\" can increase risk of depression or suicide. Counselling and prayer is used to help some Christians deal with gay urges. The bill was signed over the weekend along with more than 100 pieces of legislation sent to the governor by California's state legislature. Two Christian groups, the California-based Pacific Justice Institute and the Florida-based Liberty Counsel will challenge the law. The Liberty Counsel said it planned to argue in its lawsuit that the measure infringes on the First Amendment and equal protection rights. In his statement, Gov Brown said sexual orientation change efforts \"have no basis in science or medicine and they will now be relegated to the dustbin of quackery\". The Human Rights Campaign, an advocacy group, said: \"We're grateful to Governor Brown for standing with California's children. \"LGBT [lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender] youth will now be protected from a practice that has not only been debunked as junk science, but has been proven to have drastically negative effects on their well-being,\" the gay rights advocate added, urging other states to take up similar measures. But the National Association for Research and Therapy on Homosexuality said the bill was a \"legislative over-reach\". Some conservative groups have said banning the therapy would restrict a parent's right to care for children going through gender confusion. California is embroiled in a long-standing legal tussle over gay marriage. A law called Proposition 8 banned same-sex marriage in California just months after it had been introduced. But a court overturned the ban in 2010. After an appeal was upheld, the matter may now come before the US Supreme Court for a final ruling.",

Violators could face disciplinary action including loss of their professional licenses.\n\n\"These practices have no basis in science or medicine and they will now be relegated to the dustbin of quackery,\" Brown said in a statement accompanying his signature on the bill.\n\nThe legislation, authored by state Senator Ted Lieu, passed the Democratic-controlled legislature along largely partisan lines earlier this year despite fierce opposition from religious and conservative groups who argued it infringes on parental rights and religious freedom.\n\nSupporters of the ban cited numerous studies showing conversion therapy can lead to depression, anxiety, and suicidal thoughts among LGBT youth. The American Psychological Association, American Medical Association, and American Academy of Pediatrics all oppose the practice, calling it ineffective and potentially harmful.\n\n\"No one should have to endure the psychological torture of conversion therapy,\" said Lieu, who represents parts of Los Angeles County. \"This sends a message that California will not tolerate discrimination against LGBT individuals.\"\n\nReligious liberty advocates vowed to challenge the law in court, arguing it violates First Amendment protections for religious counselors and interferes with parents' fundamental right to make medical decisions for their children.\n\n\"This law criminalizes religious beliefs and tramples on the rights of parents,\" said Mat Staver, chairman of Liberty Counsel, a conservative legal organization. \"We will be filing suit immediately.\"\n\nThe ban applies only to licensed mental health professionals and does not restrict religious counseling provided by clergy members or unlicensed counselors. It also includes exceptions for therapy that does not specifically attempt to change sexual orientation but helps patients cope with identity issues.\n\nLGBT advocacy groups hailed the legislation as a major victory in the fight for equality, predicting other states will follow California's lead.

    "MGT": "Scottish entrepreneur Michelle Mone has been appointed by the government to lead a comprehensive review examining how to best foster start-up businesses in regions grappling with high unemployment rates.\n\nThe appointment comes as policymakers seek innovative solutions to tackle persistent joblessness in certain areas across the country. Mone, who built her lingerie empire Ultimo from scratch and later expanded into various business ventures, will draw on her extensive entrepreneurial experience to identify barriers facing potential business founders in economically disadvantaged communities.\n\nThe review will examine existing support mechanisms for new businesses and assess whether current government initiatives are effectively reaching areas most in need of economic stimulation. Mone is expected to consult with local business leaders, unemployed individuals, and community organizations to understand the unique challenges facing different regions.\n\nKey areas of focus will include access to funding, availability of business mentorship programs, and the effectiveness of existing training schemes designed to help unemployed individuals transition into entrepreneurship. The review will also analyze successful international models that have proven effective in similar economic circumstances.\n\nGovernment officials emphasized that encouraging entrepreneurship in high-unemployment areas could create a ripple effect, generating jobs not only for business founders but also for local communities as these ventures grow and expand.\n\nMone expressed enthusiasm for the role, stating that her own journey from humble beginnings to business success demonstrates the potential that exists in every community. She highlighted the importance of removing bureaucratic obstacles and ensuring that aspiring entrepreneurs have access to the resources and support networks necessary to transform their ideas into viable businesses.\n\nThe review is expected to conclude within six months, with recommendations to be implemented as part of the government's broader economic development strategy."

    "HWT": "Sean Sullivan, 20, had only passed his test the day before the crash which killed Timothy Malone near Cefn Bryn Common, Gower, on 31 July 2016. Swansea Crown Court heard Sullivan had ignored pleas from his passengers to slow down. He pleaded guilty to one count of death by dangerous driving and one of causing serious injury by dangerous driving. Sullivan also admitted two other charges of dangerous driving involving two other drivers. Prosecuting, Ian Wright said airbag data from Sullivan's car showed four seconds before impact, it was travelling at 98mph and the throttle was at 100% at 5,000 revs. \"Essentially, his foot was touching the floorboard,\" he said. The court heard Mr Malone, who was was staying in a nearby caravan with his wife, Yvonne Howard, was unable to take evasive action or avoid the head on collision on the country road. Addressing Sullivan in court, Mrs Howard said: \"I am haunted by the images of the terrible events of that night - the last time I saw him. \"I cannot heal my tattered heart and soul. I go to sleep in sadness and wake up to sadness. My face is wet with tears every day.\" Judge Peter Heywood sentenced Sullivan to five years in a young offenders' institution. He will also be banned from driving for four years following his release. Speaking after the case, Inspector Steve Davies of South Wales Police, said: \"Our thoughts, as ever, are with the family and friends of Timothy Malone who lost his life in such devastating circumstances at Cefn Bryn in Gower, last summer. \"This tragic loss of the life has once again highlighted the consequences of a young and inexperienced driver, driving at excessive speed, which puts drivers, passengers and innocent road users at risk of serious injury or death.\"",
    "MGT": "# Fatal 100mph Crash: New Driver Jailed for Five Years\n\nIn a tragic incident that has shocked the local community, a newly licensed driver has been sentenced to five years in prison after causing a fatal collision while traveling at approximately 100mph. The crash resulted in the death of a holidaymaker who was visiting the area.\n\nThe court heard that the inexperienced driver, who had obtained their license only months before the incident, was traveling at excessive speeds on a stretch of road with a significantly lower speed limit. Prosecutors presented evidence showing the vehicle was moving at around 100mph moments before impact, more than double the legal limit for the area.\n\nAccording to witness testimonies, the driver lost control of the vehicle before colliding with the victim's car. Emergency services were called to the scene, but despite their best efforts, the holidaymaker was pronounced dead shortly afterward.\n\nDuring the sentencing hearing, the judge described the defendant's actions as \"a flagrant disregard for the safety of others\" and \"a catastrophic error of judgment with the most severe consequences.\" The judge noted that the driver's inexperience combined with excessive speed created a lethal situation that could have been entirely avoided.\n\nThe victim's family, who were present in court, provided emotional impact statements describing their devastating loss. They spoke of a loving family member whose vacation ended in tragedy and whose absence has left an irreparable void in their lives.\n\nIn addition to the five-year custodial sentence, the driver has been disqualified from driving for an extended period and will be required to pass an enhanced driving test before being permitted to drive again.\n\nRoad safety campaigners have cited this case as a stark reminder of the dangers of speeding, particularly among newly qualified drivers. Police officials used the opportunity to urge all motorists, especially those with limited experience, to adhere strictly to speed limits and drive according to road conditions.\n\nThe case has reignited discussions about whether additional restrictions should be placed on new drivers to prevent similar tragedies in the future."

The midfielder has shown promise in his development and offers the coaching staff flexibility in their tactical approach. His retention suggests the region sees significant potential in his continued growth as a player.\n\nThese contract renewals come at a crucial time for Scarlets as they seek to establish consistency and build competitive squads for future campaigns. The decision to secure these four players reflects the management's faith in their abilities and their role in the team's long-term plans.\n\nThe announcements will be welcomed by supporters who have watched these players develop their careers with the region.

    "HWT": "Clive Engine House has stood unused for more than 120 years after serving Talargoch Mine in Dyserth until 1884. Now county archaeologists have secured funds to repair the building, which has been affected by weathering over the decades. It was opened to the public on Friday to show how work is progressing. Denbighshire council archaeologist Fiona Gale said: \"It was a fantastic, once in a lifetime opportunity to repair the building and bring it back into good order\". Built in 1860, the Cornish engine house was home to a steam cylinder which powered water extraction pumps. Lead extraction is thought to have taken place at Talargoch since the Roman period. It has also produced copper, silver and calamine, but it is most famous as a producer of lead and zinc ore. The engine house is one of the few remaining signs of what was once a large and important industry in the area. The engine was in operation until the mine closed in 1884 when the engine was sold to the former Westminster Colliery in Wrexham. David Thomas, the Denbighshire cabinet lead member for regeneration, said the building was a \"testament to the hard work of all those who worked in the lead mines in the area over many years\". Grants from funders WREN and Cadw are paying for repair work which is being co-ordinated by Denbighshire council.",
    "MGT": "A historic 19th-century engine building that once played a crucial role in Denbighshire's mining heritage is undergoing careful restoration work. The substantial stone structure, which housed powerful pumping equipment designed to remove water from deep mine shafts, represents an important piece of Wales's industrial past.\n\nThe building served as the heart of operations for local mining activities, with its steam-powered engines working continuously to keep the mines dry and operational. Water infiltration was one of the most significant challenges faced by miners during the industrial revolution, making these pumping stations essential for successful mining operations.\n\nLocal heritage groups and conservation specialists are collaborating on the restoration project, which aims to preserve both the architectural integrity of the building and its historical significance. The work involves careful assessment of the original stonework, replacement of deteriorated materials where necessary, and stabilization of the structure's foundations.\n\nThe restoration is part of broader efforts to preserve Denbighshire's mining heritage for future generations. Officials emphasize the importance of maintaining these tangible links to the region's industrial history, which employed thousands of workers and shaped local communities for generations.\n\nOnce completed, the restored engine building is expected to serve as an educational resource, helping visitors understand the technological innovations and human challenges that defined 19th-century mining operations. The project reflects growing recognition of industrial archaeology's value in telling the story of Wales's transformation during the industrial age.\n\nThe restoration work is scheduled to continue over the coming months, with completion anticipated by early next year."

    "prompt": "An e-book at the centre of a row over who can use the term \"space marine\" is back on sale on the Amazon website.",
    "HWT": "The Spots the Space Marine story was taken off Amazon after model-soldier maker Games Workshop complained it infringed its trademark on the phrase. A blog post about the row by the story's US author, Maggie Hogarth, led to much criticism for Games Workshop. And digital rights group the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) said it had then helped Amazon \"review\" the case. In a statement about the row, the EFF said it was \"outrageous\" for Games Workshop to claim any rights over a term that had been in wide use in fiction since the 1930s. It said the case was an example of a growing trend, in which trademark and rights owners targeted the \"weakest link\" in the chain of people that helped content, be it fiction, movies or music, appear online. Often, said the EFF, the weakest link was an ISP, a hosting company or a website that acted as a store front or aggregator for many different creators. Such \"providers usually don't have the resources and/or the inclination to investigate trademark infringement claims\", it said. Many simply removed the disputed content immediately to stay \"neutral\" and avoid trouble, said the EFF, but that made it hard for those on the end of trademark claims to mount a challenge. The online chatter also prompted Games Workshop to put a statement about the row on its Facebook page, in which it said it had \"no choice\" but to act in cases where its trademarks in a commercially available product were being used without its consent. Despite this, it said, it had never claimed to have rights over the ways in which the terms \"warhammer\" or \"space marine\" were used in day-to-day speech. This everyday use also covered a \"body of prose\", it added. \"Trademarks as opposed to use of a word in prose or everyday language are two very different things,\" it said. \"Games Workshop is always vigilant in protecting the former, but never makes any claim to owning the latter.\"",
    "MGT": "An e-book that sparked a heated intellectual property dispute over the use of the term \"space marine\" has returned to Amazon's digital marketplace, marking the end of a controversial takedown that divided science fiction communities and raised questions about trademark enforcement in literature.\n\nThe book's removal had initially drawn widespread criticism from authors and readers who argued that the term \"space marine\" had become generic within science fiction, appearing in countless works across multiple decades before any formal trademark claims were established. Critics contended that allowing exclusive control over such fundamental science fiction terminology could set a dangerous precedent for creative expression in the genre.\n\nThe dispute highlighted broader tensions between corporate intellectual property protection and the collaborative nature of science fiction world-building, where certain concepts and terms have evolved organically across the community over time. Many authors expressed concern that overly aggressive trademark enforcement could stifle creativity and limit the vocabulary available to science fiction writers.\n\nLegal experts noted that trademark law typically requires terms to be distinctive and not merely descriptive to qualify for protection. The phrase \"space marine\" describes a fairly straightforward military concept adapted for futuristic settings, leading some to question whether it meets the distinctiveness threshold required for trademark status.\n\nThe controversy also drew attention to Amazon's content review processes and how quickly disputed material can be removed from digital platforms. Publishers and authors raised concerns about the ease with which intellectual property claims can result in immediate takedowns, potentially affecting authors' livelihoods before disputes are properly resolved.\n\nIndustry observers pointed out that science fiction has long been built on shared concepts and iterative world-building, with terms like \"space marine,\" \"starship,\" and \"alien invasion\" forming part of the genre's common lexicon. The case underscored ongoing debates about where the line should be drawn between legitimate trademark protection and overreach that could harm creative communities.\n\nThe book's return to sale suggests that the parties involved may have reached some form of resolution, though specific details of any agreement remain undisclosed. The incident has nonetheless served as a catalyst for broader discussions about intellectual property rights in digital publishing and the balance between protecting creators' interests and preserving the collaborative spirit that has historically defined science fiction literature."

    "HWT": "It all started when the head of Israel's association of tour operators posted a photo of the bill, suggesting the visitors may have been \"suckered\". But the restaurant's owners contest this, and give a different version of how the meal unfolded. They say the group had a gourmet meal and the venue was closed to host them. The bill, from the popular Abu Ghosh restaurant on the outskirts of West Jerusalem, allegedly included 5,900 shekels in alcohol, 4,000 shekels for the use of the private room and 3,150 shekels for the main course. On top of what was consumed by the group, there was a service charge of 1,500 shekels. In a post on Facebook (in Hebrew) with a picture of the bill, Yossi Fatael, chairman of the Israel Incoming Tour Operators Association, said the group's tourist agent confirmed they had paid the bill. \"There may be a billion Chinese, but they may not all be suckers,\" he said. \"This is how we are destroying our own budding potential of the Chinese market in Israel.\" But Jawdat Ibrahim, one of Abu Ghosh's owners, disputed this. He said, also on Facebook (in Hebrew), the group had a gourmet meal that lasted for eight hours, with special desserts, specially ordered alcoholic drinks and artists - and that the restaurant was closed to the public to host them. He also said the eight had insisted on paying the service charge. The post had pictures of what he said was the specially produced decoration to host the group. The Chinese visitors have not been identified. Some 6,900 Chinese tourists visited Israel in July, according to the Central Bureau of Statistics.

The astronomical bill, averaging over $549 per person, has raised serious questions about whether the tourists were deliberately overcharged due to their nationality.\n\nDetails of the dining experience remain unclear, but the substantial amount has prompted widespread criticism from both local residents and international observers. Many have expressed outrage at what they perceive as exploitative behavior targeting foreign visitors, particularly those from China, who represent a growing segment of Israel's tourism market.\n\nThe controversy has highlighted broader concerns about pricing transparency in tourist areas, where establishments sometimes employ different pricing structures for locals versus international visitors. Critics argue that such practices damage Israel's reputation as a welcoming destination and could deter future tourism from China and other countries.\n\nSocial media users have been quick to share their own experiences and opinions, with many calling for greater regulation of restaurant pricing in tourist zones. Some have demanded that authorities investigate the establishment in question to determine whether any laws were violated in the billing process.\n\nThe incident comes at a time when Israel has been working to strengthen its tourism ties with China and other Asian markets. Chinese tourists have become increasingly important to Israel's economy, making such controversies particularly sensitive for the tourism industry.\n\nRestaurant industry representatives have yet to provide a comprehensive response to the allegations, though some have defended variable pricing as standard practice in tourist areas worldwide. However, the scale of this particular bill has struck many as excessive regardless of location or clientele.\n\nThe debate continues to rage online, with calls growing for clearer pricing standards and better protection for tourists. The incident serves as a reminder of the delicate balance between maximizing revenue and maintaining ethical business practices in the competitive tourism sector."

    "HWT": "Cyprus was the only crisis-hit eurozone country to restrict capital transfers, as it faced a run on the banks. The controls were eased in January. There will no longer be a monthly cap of €20,000 (£15,000; $22,000) on transfers by individuals to foreign banks, or of €10,000 for travellers moving money out of the country. Cyprus received a €10bn bailout from the EU and International Monetary Fund (IMF) after its biggest banks nearly collapsed in March 2013 because of huge losses on their Greek investments. The island's second-biggest lender, Cyprus Popular Bank (also known as Laiki Bank), was wound up and deposits worth more than €100,000 in the largest bank, Bank of Cyprus, were seized. Those measures were part of the deal to ensure that Cyprus funded part of the €10bn bailout. Speaking on Friday, Cyprus President Nicos Anastasiades voiced confidence that the Mediterranean island was recovering well, despite three years of recession. Lifting capital controls, he said, was \"a vote of confidence in our banking system which, now fully independent of Greek banking institutions, can move forward\". The Greek debt crisis had a severe impact on Cypriot banks, which lost about €4.5bn worth of Greek sovereign bonds - equivalent to 25% of Cypriot gross domestic product, Reuters news agency reports.",
    "MGT": "Cyprus announced today it will lift the final capital controls that were imposed on its banking system during the devastating financial crisis of 2013, marking the end of an unprecedented chapter in the Mediterranean island nation's economic history.\n\nThe controls, which restricted the movement of money out of Cyprus, were initially implemented as emergency measures when the country's banking sector collapsed over a decade ago. The crisis forced Cyprus to seek a bailout from international creditors and led to the closure of the country's second-largest bank, Laiki Bank.\n\nAt their peak, the restrictions severely limited cash withdrawals, banned the cashing of checks, and prohibited most money transfers abroad. Citizens faced daily withdrawal limits and businesses struggled with payment restrictions that hampered normal commercial operations.\n\nThe gradual removal of these controls began in 2013, with authorities slowly easing restrictions as the banking system stabilized and confidence returned. The lifting of the remaining measures represents a significant milestone in Cyprus's economic recovery and signals the government's confidence in the stability of its financial institutions.\n\nCyprus's finance ministry stated that the decision reflects the improved health of the banking sector and the country's overall economic progress since the crisis. The island nation has worked steadily to rebuild its reputation as a financial services hub and restore investor confidence.\n\nThe removal of all capital controls is expected to boost business activity and facilitate international transactions, further supporting Cyprus's ongoing economic recovery and its position within the European Union's financial framework."

    "HWT": "The 21-month-old from Sheffield went missing during a family holiday in 1991. Following a suggestion he may have been killed and buried on the island a fresh excavation of farmland began on Monday. The four or five graves are believed to date from 1,500 years ago but police said the discovery would not hamper the investigation. Forensic archaeologists have said they are confident the search is being conducted at exactly the right depth of soil relevant to 25 years ago. The digging has concentrated on an area around a waste tank. Nutrients found in the soil have indicated human traces and a full analysis of soil samples will be carried out. Officers have said they believe the material will most likely relate to a nearby cess tank. Danny Savage, BBC correspondent in Kos The graves found in Kos are all believed to contain the remains of adults. They are lying head to toe close to the boundary of the olive grove where the dig is taking place. Work will continue around them and police said the ancient discovery was not unexpected. There was initial concern from Greek locals that this would have hindered progress at the site but I have been told by the investigating team here in Kos that is not the case. The site being searched is on land where Ben was last seen playing while his grandfather was renovating a property 25 years ago.

The contraction comes as a significant blow to government efforts to revitalise economic activity and address the country's high unemployment rate.\n\nEconomic analysts had warned of potential headwinds facing the South African economy, citing concerns over energy infrastructure, policy uncertainty, and global market conditions. The first-quarter decline represents a sharp reversal from previous expectations of modest growth.\n\nThe poor performance is likely to intensify pressure on policymakers to implement more aggressive economic reforms and stimulus measures. South Africa has struggled with sluggish growth for much of the past decade, with various sectors including manufacturing, mining, and agriculture facing ongoing challenges.\n\nFinance ministry officials are expected to respond to the data in coming days, with markets closely watching for any indication of revised economic forecasts or policy adjustments. The contraction raises questions about the country's ability to meet its annual growth targets and reduce persistently high levels of unemployment."

Crusaders replied through Michael Carvill, Paul Heatley and an Aaron Smyth own goal but sub Ben Roy's 87th minute finish sealed the surprise win. Josh Robinson of Crusaders and Carrick boss Gary Haveron got late red cards. Crusaders remain five points ahead of second-placed Linfield. Defender Robinson received the red card for a crunching touchline challenge on home striker Roy. It sparked ugly scenes as players and management clashed on the side of the pitch. Rangers manager Haveron was sent to the stand for his part in the unseemly scuffle. However, the Carrick boss will have been pleased with his side as they move above Ballinamallard and into 10th place in the relegation battle. They had lost their last 13 matches against the Crues, but raced into an early lead thanks to a curling Kelly effort. Salley doubled their advantage on 29 minutes when he rifled the ball past keeper Sean O'Neill. It was the youngster's second goal since joining Rangers on loan from Linfield in January. Salley then turned provider for Carrick's third, beating Colin Coates before teeing up Harmon for a simple finish before the break. Crusaders hit back with Carvill pouncing early in the second half and, when Heatley pounced on a poor kick-out by keeper Brian Neeson to make it 3-2, the comeback looked on.

Their persistence paid off midway through the first half when Assombalonga, displaying the predatory instincts that have made him such a valuable asset, pounced on a loose ball in the penalty area following a corner. The striker made no mistake from close range, firing past the Exeter goalkeeper to give Peterborough a deserved lead.\n\nExeter, to their credit, responded with determination after falling behind. The visitors created a handful of promising situations but lacked the clinical edge in the final third to truly trouble the Peterborough defense. Their best opportunity came just before halftime when a well-struck effort from the edge of the area forced the Peterborough goalkeeper into a spectacular diving save.\n\nAfter the interval, Peterborough continued to look the more dangerous side. The second goal arrived in the 63rd minute through a moment of individual brilliance from Mendez-Laing. The winger collected the ball on the right flank, cut inside past two defenders, and curled a sublime left-footed effort into the far corner, leaving the goalkeeper with no chance.\n\nWith a two-goal cushion, Peterborough managed the remainder of the match professionally, limiting Exeter to speculative efforts from distance. The visitors pushed forward in the closing stages but couldn't find a way through a resolute defense.\n\nThe victory ensures Peterborough's name will be in the hat for the second-round draw, keeping alive their hopes of a potentially lucrative cup run. For Exeter, attention now returns to their league campaign after a valiant but ultimately unsuccessful cup effort.\n\nThe result extends Peterborough's impressive recent form and will provide additional confidence as they look to maintain momentum across all competitions in the weeks ahead."

    "HWT": "It indicates average day school fees are now £13,194 per year and boarding fees cost an average of £30,369. Private schooling from primary age to A-levels totals £286,000 for a day place and £468,000 for a boarder, the report from Killik and Co finds. London remains the most expensive region, with an average day school place costing £15,500 per year. The north of England and Scotland were the cheapest, at £10,400 and £10,700 respectively. In a survey of 250 parents who privately educate their children, over a third (37.2%) said they saw private education as an \"investment priority\". Of those surveyed, 34% said the attraction of smaller class sizes was a major consideration. Almost a quarter said they sent their children to private school for \"the connections my children will get\" (24.8%). Another main reason was that \"either myself or a member of my family went there\" (18%). Sarah Lord, managing director of Killik financial planners, said: \"The cost of private education is eye-watering for many families. However, over a third of parents responded that investment in education is one of the best investments they can make. \"Of course, private education is not going to be viable for everybody. For some, it will make much more sense to opt for a good state school and invest the money elsewhere. \"Indeed, 14 years of day school fees from 2015 could be invested over this time to build a potential sum of around £800,000, which would help children later on in life, whether that be funding university, buying a house, or securing a comfortable retirement.\"",
    "MGT": "Private school fees in the UK have reached astronomical levels, with new research revealing that parents now face a staggering £286,000 bill to put a child through a complete 14-year private education.\n\nThe figure, which covers education from reception through to sixth form, represents a significant financial burden for families considering independent schooling. This cost encompasses tuition fees alone and does not include additional expenses such as uniforms, textbooks, extracurricular activities, or boarding fees where applicable.\n\nThe research highlights the growing divide between state and private education costs, with private school fees continuing to rise well above the rate of inflation. Many prestigious independent schools now charge upwards of £20,000 per year, with some of the most exclusive institutions demanding even higher fees.\n\nEducation experts suggest that the rising costs reflect increased investment in facilities, smaller class sizes, and enhanced educational resources. Private schools argue that the fees support superior teacher-to-pupil ratios, state-of-the-art equipment, and extensive extracurricular programs that provide students with competitive advantages.\n\nHowever, the escalating costs are placing private education increasingly out of reach for middle-class families who previously might have considered independent schooling. Financial advisors recommend that parents begin saving early, potentially from birth, to accumulate the necessary funds.\n\nSome families are exploring alternative strategies, including part-time private education, selecting schools for specific key stages, or combining state and private schooling to manage costs. Educational consultants note that scholarship opportunities and bursaries remain available, though competition for these awards has intensified.\n\nThe findings underscore broader concerns about educational inequality and access to premium schooling. Critics argue that such high costs create barriers that limit educational opportunities based on family wealth rather than student potential.\n\nAs private school fees continue their upward trajectory, families face increasingly difficult decisions about their children's education, weighing financial constraints against perceived educational advantages in an competitive academic landscape."

    "HWT": "The machine was first used to crack messages sent by Hitler and his generals on 5 February 1944. The celebration will bring together some of the machine's creators and operators at The National Museum of Computing (TNMOC). The machine's code-cracking prowess will be demonstrated on the day using the museum's rebuilt Colossus. Now widely recognised as the first electronic computer, Colossus was kept a secret for 30 years because of the sensitive work it did during World War Two to crack German codes. The work of the Colossus machines to decipher messages scrambled using the Lorenz enciphering machine that passed between the Wehrmacht's commanders is widely thought to have shortened the war and saved countless lives. Colossus was created by Post Office engineer Tommy Flowers, and his first prototype was built out of parts from telephone exchanges including 1,600 valves. Later versions used even more valves and by the end of the war 10 of the machines were in use in the UK. The celebrations will bring together some of the women who kept the different machines running as well as some of the engineers who built and maintained them. During wartime, about 550 people worked in the Bletchley Park unit that ran Colossus. Also attending will be some of the children of the machine's creators and operators. Most of the machines were broken up and the plans destroyed after the war in an attempt to keep the work secret and to conceal the fact Britain was still using two of the machines to read Soviet messages. \"The achievements of those who worked at Bletchley Park are humbling,\" said Tim Reynolds, chair of TNMOC. \"This day is in honour of all the men and women who worked on breaking the Lorenz cipher.\"",
    "MGT": "The 70th anniversary of Colossus, the world's first programmable electronic computer, is being commemorated at Bletchley Park, the historic site where this groundbreaking machine helped change the course of World War II and laid the foundation for the digital age.\n\nColossus was developed in secret during the war to break the complex Lorenz cipher used by German high command for their most sensitive communications. The machine, standing over seven feet tall and containing more than 1,500 electronic valves, represented a quantum leap in computing technology when it became operational in 1944.\n\nThe computer was the brainchild of engineer Tommy Flowers, who worked tirelessly at the Post Office Research Station to bring his vision to life. Despite initial skepticism from colleagues who doubted that electronic valves could work reliably in such large numbers, Flowers persevered, funding much of the early development from his own pocket.\n\nTen Colossus machines were eventually built, processing thousands of intercepted messages and providing crucial intelligence that historians believe shortened the war by up to two years. The machines could analyze encrypted text at unprecedented speed, reducing decryption time from weeks to hours.\n\nAfter the war ended, eight of the machines were dismantled on Winston Churchill's orders to maintain secrecy. The existence of Colossus remained classified until the 1970s, robbing Flowers and his team of recognition for decades.\n\nToday, Bletchley Park houses a fully functioning replica of Colossus, painstakingly reconstructed by a dedicated team of volunteers led by Tony Sale. The replica demonstrates the machine's original capabilities, allowing visitors to witness firsthand the technology that bridged the gap between mechanical calculators and modern computers.\n\nThe anniversary celebration highlights not only the technical achievement but also the human stories of the codebreakers, engineers, and support staff who worked in secrecy. Their contributions to both the war effort and the birth of computing continue to resonate in our increasingly digital world, making Colossus a fitting symbol of British innovation and determination."

    "HWT": "Ryan Lock, 20, from Chichester in West Sussex, died fighting alongside Kurdish forces near Raqqa on 21 December. It is believed he turned a gun on himself to avoid being taken hostage. Dozens of people, including members of the Kurdish community, held roses and framed pictures of him, as his coffin arrived at Heathrow Airport. The former chef, who had no previous military experience, joined the Kurdish armed fighting forces, the YPG, after telling his family he was going on holiday to Turkey in August. The YPG told the BBC that \"trace of a gunshot wound was found under the chin\", suggesting suicide. Staff at Heathrow were rather caught off guard as Ryan Lock's body arrived home. No-one at the cargo bay of Royal Jordanian Airlines expected to see a crowd of mourners arriving on their forecourt. With just a couple of hours notice, Kurds young and old turned out to pay tribute to a man from Chichester whom they had never met. \"This is not just a foreign war, this is a fight for humanity\", one told me. \"International solidarity\" they chant as they place flowers over the private ambulance carrying Ryan Lock's coffin. They hold their hands up in silent salute. To have a British man fight their cause, touches their hearts. A Kurdish mother kisses the ambulance and weeps as it drives away. Supporters of the YPJ female-fighting force paid tribute to Mr Lock, saying his memory would \"forever live on in our struggle for the freedom of Syria and our hope for change in the whole world\". YPG general command member Mihyedin Xirki had previously said Mr Lock was a \"martyr\" who died \"putting up a brave fight\". The volunteer, who attended school in Havant, Hampshire, became the third British man to die fighting alongside the Kurds against so-called Islamic State. The Foreign Office continues to advise against all travel to Syria.",
    "MGT": "The body of a British volunteer who lost his life fighting against so-called Islamic State in Syria has returned to the United Kingdom, where he was greeted with tributes befitting a hero who made the ultimate sacrifice for his beliefs.\n\nThe fallen fighter, who travelled to Syria to join Kurdish forces in their battle against the extremist group, was repatriated following extensive diplomatic efforts involving British consular officials and international partners in the region. His death marks another tragic loss among the estimated dozens of Western volunteers who have joined the fight against ISIS in Syria and Iraq.\n\nFamily members, supporters, and military veterans gathered to pay their respects as the body arrived on British soil. The emotional scenes highlighted the complex feelings surrounding those who chose to take up arms against the terrorist organization, despite official government warnings against travelling to the conflict zone.\n\nThe volunteer had reportedly been fighting alongside the Kurdish People's Protection Units, known as the YPG, which has been at the forefront of the ground campaign against Islamic State militants. These Kurdish forces have welcomed international volunteers, with fighters from various countries joining their ranks to combat what they view as a global threat to civilization.\n\nHis death comes amid ongoing operations to eliminate remaining ISIS strongholds in eastern Syria, where coalition airstrikes continue to support ground forces in what has become a grinding campaign to defeat the extremist group's territorial ambitions.\n\nBritish authorities have consistently advised against travel to Syria, citing extreme dangers and the complex legal implications of involvement in foreign conflicts. However, this has not deterred individuals who feel compelled to take direct action against ISIS following the group's numerous terrorist attacks and brutal tactics.\n\nThe volunteer's journey reflects a broader phenomenon of Western citizens who have chosen to fight ISIS independently of their governments' official military involvement. While some have faced legal consequences upon their return, others have been viewed sympathetically by communities who see them as having fought against a universally condemned enemy.\n\nHis family described him as someone who felt morally obligated to act against injustice, emphasizing his commitment to protecting innocent civilians from ISIS brutality. The homecoming serves as a poignant reminder of the ongoing human cost in the fight against extremism."

South West Trains said the swan was moved quickly but services were delayed by 30 minutes throughout the morning. A spokesman for the rail company apologised for the disruption. He said \"staff attended the site and moved the swan to safety\" but the incident caused further \"knock-on delays\", particularly between Clapham Junction and Waterloo. End of Twitter post  by @BenRooney85 While some commuters were quick to forgive the avian trespasser on Twitter, others vented their anger at South West Trains for it being the \"fourth day in a row\" of delays.

The incident occurred just as commuters were dealing with significant delays caused by planned maintenance work at the busy terminus.\n\n\"We had to stop all services immediately for safety reasons,\" said a Network Rail spokesperson. \"Our priority was ensuring both passenger safety and the welfare of the swan.\"\n\nThe disruption lasted approximately 45 minutes as trained personnel carefully coaxed the bird away from the electrified rails. Videos shared on social media showed the swan apparently unbothered by the commotion, taking its time before eventually being guided to safety.\n\nPassengers expressed a mixture of frustration and amusement at the unusual delay. \"First the engineering works, now this,\" said commuter Sarah Mitchell. \"At least it's a story to tell.\"\n\nThe swan incident added to existing delays of up to 30 minutes caused by the planned works, which are part of a major upgrade project expected to continue through the month.

    "HWT": "The Royal College of Midwives (RCM) and Public Heath Wales stressed the dangers of flu to pregnant women and reminded expectant mothers to get vaccinated. Pregnant women are more vulnerable to infections and cannot fight off flu as well as other people. Dr Richard Roberts, of Public Health Wales, said there can be \"severe complications\" for mothers and babies. Pregnant women who catch flu are more likely to deliver early, with an increased risk of stillbirth or illness for a baby in their first week. Helen Rogers, director of RCM, said it \"strongly recommends\" pregnant women have the vaccination, saying they can have it \"at any stage during their pregnancy\". \"We also urge midwives and other health professionals to have the vaccination to protect themselves, their family and the people they care for from infection as well,\" she added. Dr Richard Roberts, head of the vaccine preventable disease programme at Public Health Wales, said flu can be \"devastating for the woman and her unborn baby\". The annual flu vaccination programme aims to make sure the people who need it most get free protection each year, including those aged 65 and over and people with certain long-term health conditions, as well as pregnant women. All children aged two and three years old on 31 August 2016, and those in reception class, year one, two and three in school are also being offered protection with a nasal spray flu vaccine. Two and three-year-olds will get their spray at GP surgeries, while those up to year three will be offered the vaccine at school.",
    "MGT": "Pregnant women across Wales are being strongly urged to receive free flu vaccinations this winter as health authorities launch a comprehensive immunization campaign aimed at protecting both mothers and their unborn children.\n\nThe Welsh Government and Public Health Wales have joined forces to emphasize the critical importance of flu jabs for expectant mothers, highlighting that pregnancy naturally weakens the immune system, making women more susceptible to severe complications from influenza. The vaccination is available at no cost through GP surgeries, pharmacies, and maternity clinics throughout the country.\n\nDr. Sarah Jenkins, consultant obstetrician at Cardiff University Hospital, explained that pregnant women face significantly higher risks when contracting flu, including pneumonia, hospitalization, and in severe cases, premature labor. \"The flu vaccine not only protects the mother but also provides crucial antibodies to the developing baby, offering protection during their first few months of life when they're too young to be vaccinated themselves,\" she stated.\n\nStatistics from previous winters show that pregnant women are five times more likely to be hospitalized with flu-related complications compared to non-pregnant women of the same age. The vaccination program has demonstrated remarkable effectiveness, with studies indicating a 40% reduction in flu cases among vaccinated pregnant women.\n\nHealth Minister Eluned Morgan stressed that the vaccine has been safely administered to millions of pregnant women worldwide for over a decade. \"We have robust evidence showing the flu vaccine is completely safe during pregnancy and provides vital protection when women need it most,\" she said.\n\nThe immunization campaign comes as Wales prepares for what experts predict could be a challenging flu season. Pregnant women can receive the vaccination at any stage of pregnancy, with healthcare providers recommending early immunization for optimal protection.\n\nLocal health boards are working to ensure easy access to vaccines, with many offering extended clinic hours and walk-in appointments to accommodate expectant mothers' schedules."

Juan Zuniga and Nordin Amrabat have joined Watford's lengthy injury list after suffering ankle and leg injuries respectively on Sunday. However, Hornets defender Miguel Britos returns after a one-match ban. Stoke manager Mark Hughes: \"We're giving goals up too readily. We'll address that. A lot of the elements of our play, apart from that, are very good. We had a good result against Watford not too long back. We just need to revisit our thoughts on that one and play as well as we know we can, but clearly take out the catastrophic errors.\" Watford head coach Walter Mazzarri: \"We have 50 per cent less time to prepare than Stoke. They had more rest than us. \"It will be very difficult but I guarantee we will do everything possible to defend the badge.\" One to watch from behind the settee.

    "MGT": "Stoke City has received a significant boost ahead of their crucial Premier League clash with Watford as controversial forward Marko Arnautovic returns to the squad following his three-match suspension. The Austrian international had been sidelined after a violent conduct charge stemming from an incident in the team's previous encounter.\n\nThe 27-year-old's return couldn't have come at a better time for the Potters, who have struggled to find the back of the net in his absence. Arnautovic, who has been one of Stoke's most influential players this season, has contributed six goals and five assists in his 22 appearances before the suspension.\n\nManager Mark Hughes expressed his relief at having his star forward back in contention, telling reporters at the pre-match press conference, \"Marko's return gives us more options in attack, and we've certainly missed his creativity in the final third. He's been training well and is eager to make up for lost time.\"\n\nThe suspension came at a crucial period for Stoke City, who have managed just one win in their last four matches. Arnautovic's absence was particularly felt in their recent goalless draw against West Ham, where the team struggled to create meaningful chances.\n\nThe forward's availability provides a welcome selection headache for Hughes, who must decide whether to immediately reinstate Arnautovic to the starting lineup or ease him back from the bench. The Austrian's combination play with midfielder Xherdan Shaqiri has been a highlight of Stoke's attacking play this season, and fans will be hoping to see this partnership rekindled against Watford.\n\nWatford's defense will need to be particularly vigilant against Arnautovic, who scored in the reverse fixture earlier this season. The match, scheduled for Saturday afternoon at the Bet365 Stadium, could prove crucial for both teams' aspirations of securing a comfortable mid-table position in the Premier League."

    "HWT": "The muppet was donated by creator Jim Henson's widow Jane, along with nine other characters from the 1955 TV show Sam and Friends. Some of the other muppets in the collection include early versions of Cookie Monster and Oscar the Grouch. Henson's oldest puppet, Pierre the French Rat, was also donated. Jane Henson said the original characters provided five minutes of fun each night after the local news where they mostly mimed to popular music. \"I think people realized that if you put Kermit's face up there, it was just as powerful - we were mostly just doing it to entertain ourselves,\" she said. The Smithsonian already has a familiar Kermit the Frog puppet made famous on Sesame Street and The Muppet Show. But the original Kermit looked more like a lizard, made with ping-pong ball eyes and green felt from an old coat thrown out by Henson's mother. Museum curator Dwight Blocker Bowers said the muppets would be a boon for the museum's collection. \"It certainly shows the muppets at the beginning of the career of a large family of entertainers,\" he said. \"More than anything, I think it shows the genius of Jim Henson.\" Bowers said the museum plans to have the original muppets on display by November in the pop culture gallery.

The original Kermit, made from Henson's mother's old coat and ping-pong balls for eyes, represents the humble beginnings of what would become a global entertainment phenomenon.\n\n\"Kermit the Frog is not just a beloved character, but a symbol of American creativity and innovation,\" said the museum's director during the acceptance ceremony. \"Having the original puppet in our collection allows us to preserve an important piece of our cultural heritage for generations to come.\"\n\nBefore becoming the familiar amphibian known worldwide, the early version of Kermit appeared on Henson's first television program, \"Sam and Friends,\" which aired locally in Washington, D.C. The character evolved over time into the charming, banjo-playing frog that would later host \"The Muppet Show\" and star in numerous films.\n\nThe puppet will join other treasured American pop culture artifacts in the museum's entertainment collection, including Dorothy's ruby slippers from \"The Wizard of Oz\" and Archie Bunker's chair from \"All in the Family.\"\n\nVisitors can view the original Kermit starting next month in a special exhibition celebrating Jim Henson's contributions to American entertainment. Museum curators have worked closely with conservation specialists to ensure the delicate puppet will be preserved while on display.\n\nFor many Americans who grew up watching Kermit, this acquisition represents more than nostalgia—it acknowledges the significant impact of Henson's creations on American cultural identity."

    "HWT": "Educating is back for a fourth series aiming to show real life in schools using a fly on the wall format. The last three series have been praised for showing an insight into what education is like in Britain. But there's also been criticism they focussed too much on bullying, bad language and teen pregnancies. As someone who was once a teacher (all be it a substitute) I can tell you there is just as much bad language in a staff room as there is in the common room. But try not offending someone in 2014. With that in mind the producers have planned a fourth series and to tick another regional box they've decided to head to Wales for the first time. The location will be Willows High School in Cardiff where the head teacher has said she's simply \"delighted\" that the programme will be showing off their high standards. Over the last few years the school has become one of the most improving schools in Wales. Head teacher Joy Ballard said: \"Willows has been on an incredible journey over the past three years and has been transformed from one of the worst performing schools in the country to a school that we are very proud of.\" The nine-episode series will air in autumn. Executive producer at Channel 4 David Clews said: \"You can really feel the charm and character of the place as soon as you walk through the gates and start talking to the students. \"We really are excited about making Educating in Wales.\" Channel 4 has been pumping millions of pounds into it's documentary making in the last few years and the Educating series has certainly been a success. Commissioning editor, David Brindley, said the series \"promises to unearth more inspirational, humorous and moving stories from the corridors of this characterful Cardiff school\".",
    "MGT": "Channel 4's groundbreaking educational reality series is set to make its debut in Wales, with Cardiff becoming the latest location to benefit from the broadcaster's innovative approach to documentary filmmaking about British education.\n\nFollowing the tremendous success of previous installations that captured the hearts of viewers across the nation, the production team has chosen Cardiff as the setting for their newest venture. The decision comes after extensive consultation with local education authorities and careful consideration of schools that could provide compelling narratives about modern teaching challenges and student experiences.\n\nThe series, which has previously shone a spotlight on educational institutions in Essex, Yorkshire, and East London, has consistently delivered powerful storytelling that resonates with audiences nationwide. Each iteration has revealed the dedication of teachers, the struggles and triumphs of students, and the complex realities facing contemporary British schools.\n\nCardiff's selection represents a significant opportunity for Welsh education to take center stage. Local education officials have expressed enthusiasm about the project, noting that it will provide valuable insight into the unique challenges and successes within the Welsh education system. The city's diverse student population and commitment to bilingual education are expected to add fresh dimensions to the series' established format.\n\nProduction crews have already begun preliminary work with several Cardiff schools, conducting interviews with staff and students to identify the most compelling stories. The filming process, which typically spans an academic year, will capture everything from everyday classroom interactions to major school events and personal milestones.\n\nTeachers and administrators in the selected schools have welcomed the opportunity to showcase their work, though some acknowledge the pressure that comes with having cameras document their professional lives. Students, meanwhile, appear excited about the prospect of sharing their educational journey with a national audience.\n\nThe Cardiff series is expected to maintain the authentic, unscripted approach that has made previous versions so successful. Viewers can anticipate the same blend of humor, emotion, and genuine human drama that has become the franchise's hallmark, all while gaining new perspectives on education in Wales and the broader challenges facing schools across the United Kingdom today."

    "HWT": "Where can you have a day out for less than £25? The BBC's Price of Football study has analysed data from 223 clubs across Britain and Europe to find out how much is costs supporters to follow their team. Overall, 36% of ticket prices in the division went up compared to last year's study - the biggest percentage increase across the men's leagues in the UK. The average cost of the cheapest matchday ticket has gone up to £22.11 - a six-year high - while the most expensive matchday tickets average £36.13. The average season ticket prices are at their lowest since 2013 - with the cheapest averaging £322.83 and the most expensive averaging £568.15. A £30 away ticket cap was introduced in the Premier League at the start of the season, in the same year that a record £8bn TV rights deal came into effect. With no cap in the Championship, the average price of the most expensive away ticket is £31.57 - more than £2 dearer than the top flight. However, the average in the cheapest away ticket category has fallen by 9% to £20.98 since last year. Twelve Championship clubs offer away tickets for more than £30: Aston Villa, Barnsley, Brentford, Brighton, Derby, Ipswich, Leeds, Newcastle Norwich, Nottingham Forest, QPR and Sheffield Wednesday.",
    "MGT": "Football fans traveling to support their teams in the Championship are facing steeper costs than those attending Premier League matches, with several second-tier clubs charging more for away tickets than England's top flight.\n\nRecent analysis reveals that multiple Championship sides are pricing away supporters out of the game, with some clubs charging upwards of £35 for visiting fans. This exceeds the £30 cap that Premier League clubs voluntarily agreed to implement for away tickets in 2016.\n\nLeeds United, Norwich City, and Sheffield United are among the clubs charging premium prices for away supporters, with tickets often reaching £40 or more for certain fixtures. These costs represent a significant burden for fans already dealing with travel expenses and accommodation costs when following their teams across the country.\n\nThe disparity becomes more stark when considering that Championship clubs receive substantially less television revenue than their Premier League counterparts. Despite this reduced income, many are choosing to maximize matchday revenue through higher ticket prices rather than prioritizing fan accessibility.\n\nFan groups have expressed frustration at the pricing structure, arguing that loyal supporters who travel hundreds of miles deserve better treatment. The Football Supporters' Association has called for Championship clubs to adopt similar pricing caps to those seen in the Premier League.\n\nSome clubs have defended their pricing policies, citing operational costs and the need to generate revenue in an increasingly competitive financial landscape. However, critics argue that alienating traveling supporters undermines the community spirit that makes football special.\n\nThe debate highlights the ongoing tension between commercial pressures and fan welfare in modern football."

    "HWT": "Two nightclub owners and two members of the band playing as the fire began are accused of \"negligent homicide\". A police inquiry in the city of Santa Maria found that the fire was triggered by fireworks used by the band. Most of the victims died after inhaling the toxic smoke produced when ceiling insulation foam caught fire. Investigators also criticised the fact that the venue only had one exit. The police investigation identified 16 potential accused, of which eight have been charged. Four people were charged earlier for obstructing the course of justice, including two firemen accused of hiding evidence that the club's fire licence had expired. Nightclub owners Mauro Hoffmann and Elissandro Spohr and two members of the Gurizada Fandangueira band, Marcelo de Jesus dos Santos and Luciano Bonilha Leao, face trial for manslaughter. Prosecutor Joel Dutra said the four men knew of the possible impact of their actions and failed to act. \"To die through the inhalation of toxic fumes is a cruel way of dying,\" he said. \"The reason they died was the search for profit, through the use of inadequate fireworks and highly inflammable foam on the nightclub's ceiling.\" The police report published in March said dozens of eyewitnesses reported seeing the singer on stage holding the firework which triggered the blaze. Attempts by the singer and a security guard to extinguish the fire failed when the extinguisher they used did not work, the witnesses said. Many said that the security guards at the club at first tried to stop people from leaving the club, which was found to be overcrowded. The fire, and the lack of safety precautions at the venue, have prompted widespread concern about Brazil's ability to host major sporting events in the next four years. The 2014 World Cup is set to be played in 12 Brazilian cities, while the 2016 Olympics are to take place in Rio de Janeiro.",

The charges represent a significant development in the ongoing investigation into one of the country's deadliest nightclub disasters.\n\nThe tragic incident occurred when a fire broke out at The Kiss nightclub, trapping hundreds of patrons inside the venue. The blaze spread rapidly through the establishment, creating panic and chaos as people struggled to escape. Emergency responders worked frantically to evacuate victims, but the scale of the disaster overwhelmed local resources.\n\nInvestigators have been examining multiple factors that may have contributed to the high death toll, including the venue's safety protocols, emergency exit accessibility, and fire prevention measures. The nightclub's design and capacity management during the time of the incident have also come under intense scrutiny from authorities.\n\nThe four individuals now facing manslaughter charges are believed to have played key roles in either the venue's operation or the circumstances that led to the fire. Legal experts suggest that the charges indicate prosecutors believe there was criminal negligence involved in the incident, rather than treating it as a purely accidental tragedy.\n\nFamilies of the victims have been demanding accountability since the fire occurred, organizing vigils and calling for justice for their loved ones. Many have expressed frustration with what they perceived as inadequate safety measures at entertainment venues throughout Brazil.\n\nThe case has prompted broader discussions about nightclub safety regulations across the country. Local authorities have announced plans to conduct comprehensive safety inspections of similar venues, while lawmakers are considering stricter enforcement measures for fire safety codes.\n\nThe Kiss nightclub fire joins a tragic list of similar disasters in Brazil's recent history, highlighting ongoing concerns about public safety standards in entertainment venues. Previous incidents have led to temporary improvements in safety protocols, but critics argue that enforcement remains inconsistent.\n\nThe legal proceedings are expected to continue for several months as prosecutors build their cases against the accused individuals. If convicted, those charged could face significant prison sentences under Brazil's manslaughter laws. The outcome of this case may set important precedents for how similar incidents are prosecuted in the future."

Health boards have also implemented additional clinics in community centers and mobile vaccination units in rural areas.\n\nPublic health experts warn that flu activity typically peaks between December and February, making immediate vaccination crucial for building immunity before the virus spreads further. The vaccine takes approximately two weeks to provide full protection.\n\nOfficials stress that vaccination not only protects individuals but also helps safeguard the broader community, particularly those who cannot be vaccinated due to medical reasons."

    "HWT": "\"Eve\" was discovered at Must Farm quarry at Whittlesey, Cambridgeshire, and donated to the museum last year. The museum was awarded Â£90,000 from the DCMS/Wolfson Museums and Galleries Improvement Fund to display the specimen alongside another plesiosaur. Director Prof Paul Smith said it would \"reinvigorate\" the museum. Eve will be displayed with a short-necked plesiosaur discovered near Oxford in the 1990s in new cases, and with new artwork and digital content. \"The exhibit will present a picture of central England 165 million years ago: submerged 50 metres underwater in a warm, shallow sea, teeming with animals that are now long-extinct,\" a spokesman said. Mr Smith said it would \"conserve and exhibit two internationally-significant fossil marine reptiles\". The museum is currently looking for matched funding to complete the project.",
    "MGT": "A rare long-necked plesiosaur fossil could soon captivate visitors at Oxford's Museum of Natural History after the institution successfully secured funding through a competitive grant process. The ancient marine reptile, which lived in prehistoric oceans millions of years ago, represents a significant addition to the museum's paleontological collection.\n\nPlesiosaurs were remarkable creatures that dominated ancient seas, characterized by their distinctive elongated necks, powerful flippers, and streamlined bodies adapted for aquatic life. This particular specimen is considered exceptionally rare, making it a valuable scientific and educational resource for researchers and the public alike.\n\nThe successful grant application demonstrates the museum's commitment to expanding its fossil displays and enhancing visitor experiences. Once prepared for exhibition, the plesiosaur will offer guests a unique opportunity to glimpse into Earth's distant past and understand the evolution of marine life.\n\nThe museum has not yet announced a specific timeline for when the fossil will be ready for public viewing, but preparations are expected to begin soon."

Thailand is one of the centres of the illegal trade in tigers. Tiger body parts are prized in many parts of Asia for their reputed medicinal properties. The cubs were found packed into eight plastic crates. The driver now faces the possibility of a four-year jail term or a fine of 40,000 baht ($1,300; Â£800) on wildlife-smuggling charges. The animals are now in the care of wildlife officials. Only six subspecies of tiger remain in the wild, with fewer than 1,000 tigers thought to be left in each group. Earlier this year, heads of police and customs from 13 countries with wild tiger populations agreed to tighten controls and improve cross-border co-operation to combat smuggling.",
    "MGT": "Thai authorities have arrested a truck driver after discovering 16 tiger cubs hidden in the back of his vehicle during a routine inspection. The driver was stopped at a checkpoint in central Thailand when wildlife officials made the shocking discovery.\n\nThe cubs, believed to be between two and four months old, were found packed in wooden crates without proper ventilation or care. Several appeared malnourished and dehydrated, prompting immediate veterinary attention. Wildlife experts transported the animals to a nearby rescue facility for medical evaluation and rehabilitation.\n\nThe arrested driver faces charges under Thailand's Wildlife Protection Act, which carries penalties of up to four years imprisonment and substantial fines. Authorities suspect the cubs were destined for illegal wildlife trafficking networks that supply exotic animals to private collectors or traditional medicine markets.\n\nThailand has become a major transit point for illegal wildlife trade, with tigers particularly sought after for their bones, skin, and other body parts. The country's porous borders and inadequate enforcement have made it attractive to smugglers despite recent government crackdowns.\n\nThis incident highlights the ongoing crisis facing wild tiger populations across Southeast Asia, where fewer than 4,000 tigers remain in the wild."

    "prompt": "The former speaker of Niger's parliament, Hama Amadou, will not be released from prison to campaign for elections, Niger's court of appeals has said.",
    "HWT": "Mr Amadou was arrested in November 2015 for baby-trafficking charges after fleeing to France for a year. He filed for provisional release to run in the elections but Judge Ibrahim Harouna denied the appeal on Monday. Mr Amadou says the accusations against him are politically motivated. The Constitutional Court on Saturday approved him to stand in elections. The court of appeals did not give a reason for the verdict. Mr Amadou's second wife was arrested in June 2014 along with 16 others, accused of illegally buying new-borns from \"baby factories\" in south-east Nigeria - where babies are allegedly sold for thousands of dollars. All denied any wrongdoing. Mr Amadou - a leading opposition presidential candidate - was then arrested in November 2015 after living in exile in France. Mr Amadou's supporters say the charges were fabricated to prevent him from running against President Mahamadou Issouffou in the 21 February presidential election. \"With this rejection of conditional release, the regime succeeded with its first knock-out blow,\" his lawyer, Souley Oumara, said. The BBC's Abdourahmane Dia says that Mr Amadou now has five days to appeal against the decision - or risk following the election from his prison cell. Tensions have been rising in Niger ahead of the elections. On Monday, lawyers in the country staged a 24-hour strike to oppose what they call the arbitrary arrest of government opponents. In December, President Mahamadou Issoufou said his government had foiled a plot to overthrow him. He is the favourite to win elections, though critics accuse him of becoming increasingly authoritarian as the vote nears. The campaign for the presidential election is due to start on 31 January, with 15 candidates vying for the presidency.",
    "MGT": "Niger's court of appeals has ruled that former parliamentary speaker Hama Amadou will remain in prison and will not be granted release to campaign for upcoming elections, dealing a significant blow to his political aspirations and raising questions about electoral fairness in the West African nation.\n\nAmadou, who previously served as speaker of Niger's National Assembly, had sought temporary release from detention to participate in campaign activities ahead of the elections. His legal team argued that his continued incarceration would effectively prevent him from exercising his democratic rights and competing on equal footing with other candidates.\n\nThe court's decision represents a setback for Amadou's supporters, who view the ruling as politically motivated and designed to sideline a prominent opposition figure. His case has become emblematic of broader concerns about the treatment of political opponents in Niger's judicial system.\n\nAmadou's imprisonment stems from charges that his supporters claim are fabricated and politically driven. The former speaker has maintained his innocence throughout the legal proceedings, with his defense team arguing that the charges lack merit and are intended to eliminate him from the political landscape.\n\nThe ruling comes at a critical time for Niger's democratic processes, as the country prepares for elections amid ongoing security challenges and political tensions. Opposition groups have criticized the decision as undermining democratic principles and limiting voter choice.\n\nInternational observers and human rights organizations have expressed concern about the use of the judicial system to target political figures in Niger. They argue that fair elections require all candidates to have equal opportunities to present their platforms to voters.\n\nThe appeals court's decision effectively ends Amadou's hopes of mounting a campaign from outside prison walls. His supporters now face the challenge of maintaining political momentum without their leader's direct participation in campaign activities.\n\nThis development highlights the complex intersection of law and politics in Niger, where the judiciary's independence continues to face scrutiny from both domestic and international observers concerned about democratic governance."

    "HWT": "Zhang Kai admitted to various crimes including disturbing social order in a broadcast on Thursday. He has been helping defend Christians resisting government orders to remove crosses from buildings. China says it guarantees religious freedom but there are concerns about a crackdown on Christian activities. On Friday a pastor was jailed for refusing to remove a cross from his church's roof. The authorities have justified the tearing down of crosses by saying they break planning rules. Zhang Kai was arrested last year shortly before a planned meeting with the US envoy on religious freedoms. In the broadcast, Mr Zhang said he had assisted the Christians because he wanted wealth and fame. \"I really regret doing these things, I feel very remorseful,\" he said. \"These things violated China's law and violated my personal integrity as a lawyer, and they harmed societal structure and national security.\" China frequently airs confessions from high-profile suspects on television.

The U.S. State Department emphasized that forced confessions broadcast on television before trial proceedings conclude represent a serious departure from accepted judicial practices.\n\nThe lawyer in question had been representing high-profile cases that attracted international attention before their arrest and subsequent appearance on state media. Legal experts note that televised confessions have become increasingly common in China's legal system, particularly in cases involving political dissidents, human rights advocates, and foreign nationals.\n\nInternational human rights organizations have long criticized China's use of televised confessions, arguing they constitute a form of public humiliation and prejudice potential judicial outcomes. The practice has strained diplomatic relations between China and several Western nations who advocate for transparent legal processes.\n\nThe U.S. response reflects ongoing tensions between Washington and Beijing over human rights issues and judicial independence.

    "HWT": "They are better educated than before but fewer people own their own homes, the government welfare report said. The report found that most Australians were doing well but major challenges remained for Indigenous Australians. The disabled, people suffering mental illness and domestic violence victims were also faring less well. The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) report, issued every two years, says that a baby born between 2011 and 2013 can expect to live to 80.1 years if it is a boy and 84.3 if it is a girl. The national snapshot said 15% of the current population was aged 65 and over and by 2054 this was projected to increase to 21%, or 8.4 million people. About 3% of the population is Indigenous, it added. The report showed most children were doing well and most young people were studying or working, said Acting AIHW Director Kerry Flanagan. \"Adult participation in the labour force is higher than 20 years ago, and while some people are staying at work longer, after retirement, the majority of older Australians are not using aged care services,\" said Ms Flanagan. \"On the other hand, we see that 1 in 37 children are receiving child protection services, around 2 million Australians, mostly women, have experienced partner violence since the age of 15, youth unemployment exceeds 13%, and there's been little improvement in the proportion of young people who are not fully engaged in employment, education or training.\" About 28% of the population was born overseas, with the largest number coming from the UK, followed by New Zealand and China. That compares with 24% 10 years ago.",

The report highlights that Australians are experiencing fewer years of disability and illness compared to previous generations.\n\nHealth experts attribute this remarkable achievement to several key factors, including Australia's robust healthcare system, widespread access to preventive care, and strong public health initiatives. The country's emphasis on early detection and treatment of chronic diseases has played a crucial role in extending healthy lifespans.\n\n\"We're seeing Australians not just adding years to their lives, but adding life to their years,\" said one health researcher involved in compiling the data. The findings indicate that improvements in medical technology, better lifestyle choices, and enhanced healthcare delivery have contributed significantly to these positive outcomes.\n\nThe report also notes that Australia's focus on mental health services and community support systems has helped reduce the burden of disability across all age groups. Preventive healthcare measures, including regular screenings and vaccination programs, have proven particularly effective in maintaining population health.\n\nEnvironmental factors also play a role, with Australia's outdoor lifestyle culture encouraging physical activity and social engagement well into older age. The country's food safety standards and nutrition education programs have additionally supported healthier aging.\n\nHowever, researchers emphasize that maintaining these gains will require continued investment in healthcare infrastructure and addressing emerging health challenges. The aging population presents both opportunities and challenges for the healthcare system moving forward.\n\nThe findings position Australia as a global leader in healthy aging, offering valuable insights for other nations seeking to improve their citizens' longevity and quality of life outcomes."

    "prompt": "The Dutch government has announced that it will ban the use of the mild narcotic khat.",
    "HWT": "It is a leaf-based drug that, when chewed, releases juices that act as natural stimulants and is popular with the Somali community. The Netherlands is used as a hub to transport khat imported from the Horn of Africa to other European countries. There are concerns that the drug can cause psychosis or bring on schizophrenia. The BBC's Anna Holligan in the Netherlands says the country has a traditionally liberal approach to soft drugs. However, a Dutch government report cited noise, litter and the perceived public threat posed by men who chew khat as some of the reasons for outlawing the drug. \"I'm involved in the ban because it appears to cause serious problems, particularly in the Somali community,\" Dutch immigration minister Gerd Leers is quoted as saying by Radio Netherlands. Source: www.talktofrank.com He said that 10% of Somali men in the Netherlands were badly affected by the drug. \"They are lethargic and refuse to co-operate with the government or take responsibility for themselves or their families,\" he said. Very few Dutch nationals use the drug, which is mainly chewed by people from Somalia, Ethiopia, Kenya and Yemen. Our reporter says more than 25,000 Somalis now live in the Netherlands and as the population arrived, the use of khat in the country grew. At the moment it is legally imported via Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport four times a week. Khat leaves need to be fresh, otherwise they lose their potency. Last year, khat worth around $18m (£11.6m) was brought into the Netherlands. The use of the stimulant is banned in the US, Canada and several other European countries. But it is still available in the UK where it is legally sold in a small number of grocery stores.",
    "MGT": "The Dutch government announced Tuesday that it will implement a ban on khat, the mild narcotic leaf commonly chewed in East African and Middle Eastern communities. The decision marks a significant shift in the Netherlands' traditionally liberal drug policy approach.\n\nKhat, derived from the Catha edulis plant, contains cathinone and cathine, stimulant compounds that produce effects similar to amphetamines when the fresh leaves are chewed. The plant has been used for centuries in countries like Somalia, Ethiopia, and Yemen as part of social and cultural traditions.\n\nHealth Minister Ernst Kuipers cited growing concerns about public health and safety as primary reasons for the ban. \"While we recognize the cultural significance of khat in certain communities, we cannot ignore the mounting evidence of its potential for abuse and associated social problems,\" Kuipers stated during a press conference in The Hague.\n\nThe announcement has drawn mixed reactions from affected communities across the Netherlands. Somali community leaders expressed disappointment, arguing that the ban criminalizes an important cultural practice. \"This feels like an attack on our traditions,\" said Ahmed Hassan, chairman of the Somali Community Center in Amsterdam. \"Khat is part of our social fabric, used in the same way others might drink coffee.\"\n\nHowever, some health advocates welcomed the decision. Dr. Sarah van der Berg, a addiction specialist at Amsterdam University Medical Center, noted increasing cases of khat-related mental health issues, particularly among young people. \"We've observed cases of psychosis, depression, and family disruption linked to excessive khat use,\" she explained.\n\nThe ban will take effect in six months, giving authorities time to prepare enforcement measures and community outreach programs. Possession and distribution of khat will become criminal offenses punishable by fines and potential imprisonment.\n\nCurrently, khat remains legal in several European countries, including the United Kingdom, though it has been banned in Germany, France, and most Scandinavian nations. The Netherlands joins a growing list of countries restricting access to the substance despite its legal status in many of its countries of origin.\n\nThe government plans to allocate additional resources for community support programs to help affected populations transition away from khat use."

One student said: \"I really did think it was someone who was going to jump off a building.\" Gormley is one the UK's leading artists and is probably best known for his Angel of the North. In defending the UEA installation, he said: \"These works are nothing to do with suicide, they're actually to do with life and they're placed on the skyline in a way to make us think about space and distance. \"Universities are places where people spend a lot of time thinking about the thoughts of others, \"I think it's a wonderful place to balance that intellectual life with an object that is silent, it doesn't need to be read.

However, the Canadian aerospace company sees the CSeries Paris debut as a pivotal moment. \"There's always a lot of pressure to come up with big orders,\" president of commercial aircraft Fred Cromer told the BBC. \"But right now it's like the old-fashioned days - we are here to show off the equipment.\" The company's Belfast division makes the CSeries wings at a £520m factory in Queens Island. Full production of the two different sized versions of the aircraft would support 800 jobs in a workforce of 5,700. Invest NI chief executive Alastair Hamilton, who also attended the Paris launch, said:  \"I believe they will kick on from today. There are many years ahead for this aircraft.\" Bombardier's familiar territory is executive jets and this is a major step up into larger passenger planes seating between 100 to 160 passengers. Its competitors are the big two firms Boeing and Airbus. Aviation analyst Mark Pilling of Flightglobal said \"They're two great big gorillas. \"Bombardier need to execute on this aircraft and get orders.\" The technical data announced in Paris revealed improved results on fuel economy, the main selling point of the CSeries. The larger CS300 will fly to Belfast on Friday for what is seen as a morale-boosting visit for workers.",
    "MGT": "Bombardier Confident in CSeries Prospects Following Paris Air Show\n\nCanadian aerospace manufacturer Bombardier expressed renewed confidence in securing additional orders for its CSeries aircraft after releasing new technical data at the Paris Air Show this week.\n\nThe company unveiled performance metrics showing the aircraft is exceeding initial targets for fuel efficiency, range, and operational costs. According to the data, the CSeries is delivering approximately 20% better fuel burn than previous generation aircraft in its class, potentially offering significant savings for airline operators.\n\n\"The numbers speak for themselves,\" said Jean-Paul Lambert, Bombardier's Vice President of Commercial Aircraft. \"Airlines are seeing real-world confirmation of what we've been promising - an aircraft that dramatically reduces operating costs while providing exceptional passenger comfort.\"\n\nThe CSeries, which entered commercial service in 2016 after facing development delays and cost overruns, has struggled to secure the volume of orders initially projected. However, Bombardier officials believe the newly released performance data will help convince hesitant carriers.\n\nSeveral airline representatives at the Paris Air Show expressed interest after reviewing the technical specifications. \"We're in serious discussions with multiple carriers across different regions,\" Lambert confirmed, though he declined to name specific airlines or provide a timeline for potential announcements.\n\nIndustry analysts note that the aircraft's performance in actual service with current operators like SWISS and airBaltic has been a strong selling point. \"The operational data is impressive,\" said aviation consultant Marie Dupont. \"For medium-haul routes, the economics are compelling, especially with rising fuel costs.\"\n\nBombardier faces stiff competition from established rivals Airbus and Boeing, but believes its CSeries offers unique advantages for the 100-150 seat market segment. The company is particularly targeting airlines looking to replace aging fleets on regional and transcontinental routes.\n\nBombardier executives indicated they expect to announce new CSeries orders in the coming months, bolstered by the aircraft's proven performance metrics and positive feedback from current operators."

    "MGT": "Burnley manager Sean Dyche remains optimistic despite his team's challenging start to the Premier League season, maintaining a composed outlook on their search for their first victory. Speaking at a recent press conference, Dyche emphasized that the team's current position is far from dire, stating firmly that they are \"by no means at the bottom of the valley.\"\n\nThe Clarets have faced a demanding opening schedule, competing against several top-flight heavyweights in their initial matches. Despite the absence of wins, Dyche's squad has shown promising moments of resilience and tactical discipline that have earned them valuable points through hard-fought draws.\n\n\"We've been here before,\" Dyche remarked, drawing on his extensive experience guiding Burnley through previous Premier League campaigns. \"This league is unforgiving, but we've proven time and again that we know how to navigate these challenges. The performances are there, and the results will follow.\"\n\nThe manager highlighted the team's strong defensive organization and growing attacking threat, particularly praising the work ethic displayed by his players during recent fixtures. While acknowledging the importance of securing that first win, Dyche emphasized that panic has no place in their approach.\n\nStatistics from their recent matches support Dyche's measured stance, with Burnley creating more chances and maintaining higher possession percentages compared to similar stages in previous seasons. The team's defensive record also remains relatively solid, suggesting that fine-tuning rather than wholesale changes is what's needed.\n\n\"We're seeing positive signs in training and during matches,\" Dyche added. \"The lads are working incredibly hard, and there's a real unity in the group. Sometimes in football, you need that bit of luck to turn good performances into wins, but we'll keep doing the right things.\"\n\nWith upcoming fixtures against mid-table opposition, Burnley appears well-positioned to transform their manager's confidence into points on the board. The Turf Moor faithful remain supportive, understanding that Dyche's proven track record of steering the club through challenging periods provides ample reason for optimism."

    "HWT": "Exeter's Campagnaro has started all Italy's 2016 Six Nations games and scored two tries on their 2014 visit to Cardiff. Twice-capped Zebre centre Giulio Bisegni, 23, has been called up. Italy earlier lost Edoardo Padovani, Lorenzo Cittadini and George Biagi through injuries suffered in defeat by Ireland. It means the Azzurri must make at least four changes with fly-half Padovani, prop Cittadini and lock Biagi joining Campagnaro on the sidelines.

The talented midfielder's absence deals another blow to the already struggling Italian squad, who have been grappling with several key player injuries this season.\n\nCampagnaro, known for his explosive running and defensive prowess, has been a crucial component of Italy's backline. The nature and extent of his injury have not been fully disclosed by team management, but sources close to the squad suggest he could be sidelined for several weeks.\n\nThis latest development has forced head coach Franco Smith to reconsider his tactical approach for the Wales encounter. The Italian team's depth will be tested as they seek to fill the void left by Campagnaro's absence. The timing couldn't be more challenging, as Wales has shown impressive form in recent matches.\n\nThe loss of Campagnaro adds to Italy's mounting concerns as they prepare to face a formidable Welsh side that has demonstrated both attacking flair and defensive solidity this season."

The show is due to run for another five weeks with further batches of tickets being sold on the official website. The Dismaland exhibition is a dark take on theme parks with a nod to Disneyland, featuring work by more than 50 artists including Bristolian Banksy.

    "HWT": "The figure-hugging Jean Louis gown, with 2,500 crystals, was bought by the Ripley's Believe It or Not museum chain, exceeding the $3m guide price. The company's vice president said it was \"most iconic piece of pop culture that there is\". Monroe died from a drug overdose just three months after the performance. The sultry rendition for President Kennedy's 45th birthday at a 1962 Democratic fundraiser at New York's Madison Square was one of her last public appearances. President Kennedy was shot dead a year later. The dress, which the auction house said was so tight she had to be sewn into it, had previously been bought at auction for $1.3m in 1999 by the late business mogul and collector Martin Zweig. The sum raised is likely to set a new world record for the most expensive dress sold at auction. Marilyn Monroe's billowing white dress from the Seven Year Itch sold for $4.6 million (plus $1m in commission) in 2011. The largest collection of the screen star's possessions ever offered for auction is being sold by Julien's auction house in Beverly Hills over three days. Also sold on Thursday was the cocktail dress she wore in \"Some Like it Hot\", which fetched $450,000. Many of the 1,000 lots come from the estate of her acting coach, Lee Strasberg, who became a close friend of the actress. She bequeathed her personal effects and clothing to him in her will.",

The figure-hugging, flesh-colored dress, adorned with thousands of crystals, captured a pivotal moment in American pop culture history when Monroe serenaded President John F. Kennedy at Madison Square Garden in 1962.\n\nThe dress, designed by Jean Louis, has long been considered one of the most significant pieces of Hollywood and political memorabilia. Its sheer, silk fabric was embellished with over 2,500 hand-stitched crystals, creating a scandalous illusion of nudity that caused a sensation when Monroe wore it on May 19, 1962, just months before her untimely death.\n\nThe historic garment was sold at a specialized auction house, where collectors and historians gathered to bid on this piece of American history. The winning bid far exceeded initial estimates, demonstrating the continuing fascination with both Monroe's legacy and the Kennedy era.\n\nThe dress's provenance adds to its mystique, as it represents the intersection of Hollywood glamour and political power during a unique period in American history. Monroe's sultry performance of \"Happy Birthday\" to Kennedy, who was turning 45, fueled rumors of their alleged affair and became one of the most memorable moments of the 20th century.\n\nThe sale marks one of the highest prices ever paid for a piece of Hollywood memorabilia, joining the ranks of other iconic items such as Dorothy's ruby slippers from \"The Wizard of Oz\" and Audrey Hepburn's \"Breakfast at Tiffany's\" dress.

    "HWT": "A panel of experts has recommended demolishing the buildings and removing the murals. But art experts say that as the murals were designed by Picasso for those specific buildings, they should remain where they are. The artworks were Picasso's first attempts at concrete murals. The murals were drawn specifically for the government buildings known as H and Y block. Picasso's designs were sandblasted onto the concrete both outside and inside the buildings by the Norwegian artist Carl Nesjar. Both buildings were damaged when Breivik set off a van bomb at the foot of H block in July 2011. It was the start of a series of attacks that left 77 dead, mostly teenagers on the island of Utoeya. The blast in Oslo killed eight people and badly damaged the H block, along with neighbouring ministries. A panel of experts has decided the most economical solution would be to demolish the buildings, cut the murals out and place them elsewhere. A recent poll by Norwegian newspaper Verdens Gang showed public opinion was divided, with 39.5% supporting demolition, while 34.3% thought the buildings should be kept. Artist Dag Hol was widely quoted as saying it was a \"golden opportunity\" to get rid of \"brutal, ugly and degrading architecture\". But Joern Holme, head of the Directorate for Cultural Heritage, said the buildings were historically important - architecturally, politically and artistically. \"We can't demolish the best (parts) of a cultural era just because we find it ugly today,\" he said. Norway's government has until early next year to decide what to do about the buildings. The rights to the murals are owned by the Picasso family and they must be consulted on what happens to them Claudia Andrieu, a legal expert with the Picasso Administration, said they have not been approached yet but are \"open to dialogue\".",
    "MGT": "The Norwegian government faces mounting pressure over the controversial decision to demolish buildings housing five Pablo Picasso murals damaged during Anders Breivik's devastating 2011 bombing attack in Oslo's government quarter.\n\nThe murals, created by the Spanish master between 1969 and 1971, adorned the walls of the Government Administration Services building and nearby structures that bore the brunt of the explosion that killed eight people on July 22, 2011. The artworks, considered among Picasso's most significant public commissions, have become central to an increasingly polarized national debate about preservation, memory, and renewal.\n\nSupporters of demolition argue that razing the damaged buildings represents necessary progress and healing for a traumatized nation. They contend that constructing modern, secure government facilities takes precedence over preserving art in structurally compromised buildings. The demolition camp emphasizes that maintaining the current structures would serve as a permanent reminder of Norway's darkest day.\n\nConversely, preservationists and art historians have launched fierce opposition to the demolition plans, describing the potential loss as cultural vandalism. They argue that the Picasso murals represent irreplaceable artistic heritage that transcends the tragic circumstances surrounding their damage. Several prominent Norwegian artists and intellectuals have joined international calls to save the works, proposing alternative solutions including careful removal and relocation of the murals.\n\nThe debate has extended beyond Norway's borders, with international art preservation organizations weighing in on the controversy. Critics argue that destroying the murals would constitute a secondary victory for terrorism, effectively completing the destruction that Breivik began.\n\nGovernment officials maintain that structural assessments indicate the buildings cannot be safely renovated while preserving the murals intact. However, opponents question these conclusions, citing successful restoration projects of similarly damaged historical structures elsewhere.\n\nThe Norwegian Parliament continues deliberating the matter amid growing public demonstrations and petitions demanding preservation of the artworks. The decision will ultimately determine whether these unique Picasso creations survive as testament to artistic resilience or become casualties of a nation's struggle to balance remembrance with renewal.\n\nTime pressure mounts as deteriorating building conditions threaten both public safety and the murals' preservation prospects."

In a trading statement, Aggreko said sales from its rental solutions division were down 1% on last year.

    "HWT": "The FTSE 100 closed up 57.5 points, or 0.82%, at 7,052.13, helped by Anglo America's 2.72% rise, and Rio Tinto and BHP Billiton adding 2.61% and 2.46% respectively. China's stimulus plan buoyed stocks, offsetting fears about Greece, which led to Friday's 1.3% FTSE 100 fall. Ashtead, up 2.88%, was the index's big gainer after Barclays tipped the stock. Another big mover was InterContinental Hotels, 2.35% higher on speculative chatter about a merger deal.

    "MGT": "London's FTSE 100 index rebounded today, clawing back some of the significant losses suffered during Friday's trading session. The benchmark index closed higher as investors returned to the market following the previous day's sharp decline.\n\nMining companies were at the forefront of the recovery, with several major players posting substantial gains. The sector, which had been particularly hard hit during Friday's sell-off, saw renewed investor interest as commodity prices stabilized.\n\nMarket analysts attributed the rebound to bargain hunting, with many investors viewing Friday's losses as an overreaction to recent economic concerns. The recovery suggests that investor confidence may be gradually returning after the turbulent end to last week.\n\nDespite today's positive performance, the FTSE 100 remains below levels seen earlier this month. Traders are keeping a close eye on upcoming economic data releases and corporate earnings reports that could influence market direction in the coming days.\n\nThe mining sector's strong performance today helped offset weakness in other areas, demonstrating the continued importance of commodity-related stocks to the broader London market."

    "HWT": "Those dismissed include a general and a colonel. All face prosecution for negligence, the ministry said. The attack was one of the worst in the conflict-hit nation in recent months. About 50 people are said to have died as militants armed with guns, grenades and knives targeted patients and staff at the hospital. The brutal assault caused shock and anger among the public. Many people are still demanding to know why a building that was meant to be secure was so vulnerable to attack. The hospital is heavily guarded and the government says the attackers got inside after exploding a car bomb at the gate. But other reports suggest some attackers were already inside the hospital when the violence began, meaning militants had infiltrated the high-security site. There is also a lack of clarity over how many people died. Some hospital workers quoted in local media said the toll was much higher than the figure of about 50 reported by the government. The so-called Islamic State group said it carried out the attack, but some eyewitnesses later told media the assailants shouted slogans in support of the Taliban. The deputy interior minister was sacked in the immediate aftermath of the attack.",
    "MGT": "Nine military officers have been dismissed following an investigation into last month's militant attack on a military hospital in Kabul, Afghanistan's defense ministry announced today.\n\nThe attack, which targeted the heavily fortified medical facility, exposed significant security lapses that allowed insurgents to breach the compound's defenses. Defense ministry officials confirmed that the dismissed officers held various ranks and positions within the military hierarchy responsible for the hospital's protection.\n\nThe militant assault resulted in multiple casualties among patients, medical staff, and security personnel. Witnesses described scenes of chaos as gunfire erupted within the medical complex, forcing patients and doctors to seek shelter in locked rooms and basement areas.\n\nFollowing the attack, Afghan military leadership launched a comprehensive review of security protocols at critical infrastructure sites across the capital. The investigation revealed failures in intelligence gathering, perimeter security, and rapid response procedures that contributed to the militants' ability to penetrate the facility.\n\nThe defense ministry statement emphasized that accountability measures would be strictly enforced to prevent similar incidents. Additional security reinforcements have been deployed to remaining military medical facilities throughout Kabul as precautionary measures.\n\nThis latest security breach highlights ongoing challenges faced by Afghan forces in protecting vital installations from insurgent attacks. The dismissals represent the most significant disciplinary action taken by military leadership in response to recent security failures in the capital."

The good will and support has been phenomenal. \"We've been training for two years and getting a match was a big thing for the boys.\" Sion Sonics have also been training for a year and hoping for a match, just like the Bulls. \"There are different needs within the groups,\" said Mr Morrison. \"Crowds, cheering and a different venue could have been an issue for the boys, so we took them to a parish hall for the match. \"They really enjoyed it every minute and we didn't keep a score. \"As JosÃ© Mourinho would say, it's not about the result.

Since then he has become Exeter's record Premiership points-scorer, with 953, and equalled the top flight record of nine penalties in a match in 2014. \"I was lucky enough to get capped before I came over here,\" added Whitten, who agreed a new contract at Sandy Park last week. \"But similar to the English, although they don't openly say it, they don't like to pick guys playing outside of Ireland. \"That's fair enough, I accept that stance, and I enjoy playing here.

The 34-year-old playmaker has been a cornerstone of the Chiefs' success, helping guide the club from the Championship to established Premiership contenders.\n\nWhitten, speaking about his team-mate's credentials, highlighted Steenson's experience and match-winning capabilities as key attributes that would benefit the Irish national team. The fly-half's accuracy from the tee and ability to control games from the number 10 position have made him one of the most reliable performers in English rugby.\n\nDespite being born in Belfast, Steenson has yet to receive international recognition from Ireland. His consistent club form has raised questions about why he remains overlooked by national selectors, particularly given Ireland's ongoing search for depth in the fly-half position.\n\nThe Chiefs' number 10 has been a model of consistency throughout his career, demonstrating the kind of reliability that international rugby demands. His partnership with Whitten in the Exeter backline has flourished, with both players understanding each other's game intimately.\n\nSteenson's case represents the broader challenge facing international selectors in identifying talent across different leagues and ensuring the best players receive opportunities regardless of their club affiliations."

    "HWT": "Interior Ministry spokesman Sediq Sediqqi tweeted that 64 \"innocent Afghans\" were killed and 347 wounded. A suicide attacker detonated a vehicle and a fierce gun battle followed in one of the deadliest attacks in Kabul for years. A Taliban spokesman said the group carried out the attack. It came a week after it said it was launching its \"spring offensive\", warning of large-scale attacks, although the group fights all year round. Why are the Taliban resurgent in Afghanistan? Tuesday's bombing happened during the morning rush hour in Pul-e-Mahmud, a busy neighbourhood where homes, mosques, schools and businesses nestle close to the ministry of defence, other ministries and military compounds. The blast shattered windows up to 1.6km (one mile) away. A police officer told the Associated Press it was one of the most powerful explosions he had ever heard, and he could not see or hear anything for 20 minutes after. It appears the initial blast cleared the way for Taliban fighters to enter the area - a commonly used tactic. It had previously been reported that at least 28 people had been killed and 329 injured. Mr Sediqqi told reporters that most of the 64 now reported dead were civilians. He said most of the wounded were in a stable condition. At least 71 Shia worshippers were killed in 2011 in a rare attack on a Shia shrine in Kabul.

Sean Newton's long seventh-minute throw-in was headed on by Vadaine Oliver for Parkin to volley home at the far post, and the striker then finished off a similar move with another close-range finish six minutes later. York keeper Kyle Letheren had a moment to forget when he failed to deal with Ross Stearn's simple in-swinging free-kick and allowed the ball to bounce between his legs into the back of the net. After the break, Spitfires defender Gavin Hoyte somehow cleared Amari Morgan-Smith's close-range shot off the line. Substitute Tyler Garratt then hit the post at the other end with a bouncing 25-yard drive. Oliver nearly restored York's two-goal lead when his header from an Asa Hall corner was pushed against the bar by keeper Ryan Clarke. But the striker was not to be denied as he wrapped up the points with 10 minutes left, holding off Ayo Obileye's challenge before steering a shot into the bottom corner.

From the opening whistle, York displayed an intensity and purpose that caught Eastleigh off guard, pressing high and creating numerous opportunities in the final third.\n\nYork broke the deadlock in the 23rd minute when a well-worked move down the right flank resulted in a pinpoint cross that found striker Michael Woods unmarked in the penalty area. Woods made no mistake with his header, sending the traveling supporters into raptures and giving his side the confidence boost they desperately needed.\n\nThe home side struggled to find their rhythm throughout the first half, with York's midfield trio of James Thompson, David Clarke, and captain Ryan Fallowfield controlling the tempo and breaking up Eastleigh's attacking moves before they could develop into genuine threats.\n\nEastleigh emerged from the interval with renewed vigor, pushing forward in search of an equalizer. Their best chance came in the 58th minute when winger Marcus Barnes found space on the left and delivered a dangerous cross that goalkeeper Sam Johnson did well to claim under pressure from two Eastleigh forwards.\n\nYork doubled their advantage in the 72nd minute through a moment of individual brilliance from substitute Danny Harrison. The young midfielder, who had only been on the pitch for ten minutes, picked up possession 25 yards from goal and unleashed a spectacular strike that flew into the top corner, leaving the Eastleigh goalkeeper with no chance.\n\nDespite throwing everything forward in the closing stages, Eastleigh could not find a way past York's resolute defense. The visitors defended with discipline and organization, limiting their opponents to half-chances and ensuring they would claim all three points.\n\nThe victory moves York up two places in the National League standings, providing manager Steve Watson with his first win in four attempts. For Eastleigh, the defeat extends their winless run to seven matches this year, leaving them precariously positioned just three points above the relegation zone.\n\nBoth teams will be looking to build momentum when they return to action next weekend, with York hosting promotion-chasing Wrexham while Eastleigh travel to face mid-table Aldershot Town."

The airline had warned 600 of its crew to \"shape up\" last year, but 125 had not managed to maintain the required weight, the official said. The airline says however that the issue is not one of weight, but \"fitness\". Airline officials confirmed to the BBC that the directive had been issued, but said it was part of an internal document which they could not comment on publicly. They said the basis for the recommendation was concern that \"unfit\" cabin crew would not be able to operate efficiently in emergency situations. Aviation regulations state that a Body Mass Index (BMI) of 18-25 is normal for a male cabin crew member, while for a female it is 18-22. Aviation expert Kapil Kaul told the BBC: \"An overweight crew is a signal the airline is not fit. You need a smart friendly agile crew that can complement the image of the airline.\" However, national union leader Tapan Sen denied that service rules mention any firm weight restriction for cabin crew. This is not the first time Air India has grounded staff over weight issues. In 2009, it dismissed nine hostesses for being \"overweight\" on safety grounds saying their shape could \"impair agility\". In 2004, the airline landed itself in further controversy when it said that potential air hostesses and stewards should not have any scars, acne, or any major marks on the face.",
    "MGT": "Air India, the country's national carrier, has announced plans to ground 125 cabin crew members who have been classified as \"overweight\" according to the airline's body mass index standards. The decision has sparked controversy within the aviation industry and raised concerns about workplace discrimination.\n\nThe airline's management stated that the move is part of ongoing efforts to maintain professional appearance standards and ensure operational efficiency. According to Air India's guidelines, cabin crew members must maintain specific weight requirements relative to their height, with regular health assessments conducted to monitor compliance.\n\nThe affected employees will be temporarily removed from flying duties and enrolled in mandatory fitness programs. They will receive counseling sessions with nutritionists and access to gymnasium facilities to help them meet the required standards. The airline has indicated that crew members who successfully achieve the target weight within a specified timeframe will be reinstated to their flying positions.\n\nIndustry experts have expressed mixed reactions to the policy. Supporters argue that maintaining physical fitness standards is essential for cabin crew safety responsibilities, including emergency evacuations and passenger assistance during turbulence. They emphasize that crew members must be physically capable of performing demanding duties at high altitudes.\n\nHowever, critics have denounced the decision as discriminatory and potentially harmful to employee morale. Aviation unions have threatened legal action, claiming the policy violates workers' rights and creates an unhealthy work environment focused on appearance rather than professional competence.\n\nThis development comes as Air India undergoes significant restructuring following its privatization. The airline has been implementing various operational changes to improve its competitive position in the domestic and international markets.\n\nThe grounded crew members will continue receiving their salaries during the fitness program period. Air India management expects the initiative to be completed within six months, with regular progress evaluations conducted throughout the process."

    "HWT": "Tourist guide John Alasdair Macdonald captured his image on a compact camera near Dochfour at about 21:00 on Sunday. The Maritime and Coastguard Agency got calls from people in the Highlands, Dumfries and Galloway and Cumbria concerned it was a distress flare. Mr Macdonald described his images as a \"fluke\". Mr Macdonald said: \"I was taking some new pictures to put on my Facebook page using a Sony RX100 compact camera. \"It was a beautiful, clear night and I got some nice pictures but capturing the meteor was a fluke. I will never take a picture like that again.\" Mr Macdonald, who runs the business The Hebridean Explorer, said he had seen messages on social media of a meteor being seen elsewhere, including Sleat on Skye. Meteor sightings were also said to have been made from North Uist, Oban and Mull. A \"meteorite\" mistaken for a distress flare also sparked a lifeboat search operation off the English coast on Sunday. Maryport Coastguard Rescue Team said it received numerous reports of a moving red object over the sea between Workington, Cumbria, and the Isle of Whithorn in Dumfries and Galloway. Did you see the meteor?",
    "MGT": "A spectacular meteor streaking across the night sky prompted numerous emergency calls to coastguard services in Scotland and England, with the celestial event captured in dramatic photographs from the shores of Loch Ness.\n\nThe bright fireball was visible across large portions of the United Kingdom, creating a brilliant flash that alarmed residents who mistook it for an aircraft in distress or other emergency. Concerned witnesses contacted the Maritime and Coastguard Agency reporting what they believed could be a plane crash or distress flare.\n\nThe meteor was photographed by stargazers positioned along Loch Ness, with images showing the luminous object blazing a trail through the darkness above Scotland's famous loch. The photographs clearly captured the meteor's distinctive bright tail as it burned through Earth's atmosphere.\n\nCoastguard officials confirmed they received multiple reports about the unusual light phenomenon but quickly determined that no search and rescue operations were necessary once the celestial nature of the event became apparent.\n\nMeteors of this brightness, known as fireballs, occur when space debris enters Earth's atmosphere at high speed, creating the spectacular light displays visible from the ground. The intensity of this particular meteor made it visible across hundreds of miles, explaining why emergency services in both Scotland and England fielded calls from concerned members of the public.\n\nAstronomers noted that such vivid meteor sightings, while not uncommon, rarely generate this level of public response."

    "HWT": "The homes are planned to be for social or mid-market rent and it is hoped they will all be completed by 2021. Glasgow City Council's executive committee also approved £20m to improve existing housing. Of this, £14m was announced last month as part of scheme to upgrade homes and make them available for social renting. The £34m four-year improvement and repair scheme is also being funded with £20m from the Scottish government. The funding to build homes is to be channelled through housing associations over the next four years. Eight sites in the area have been identified for development. As part of the strategy, Govanhill Housing Association has also committed £3.7m to new housing and repairs for the duration of the four year period. Overall this means there are plans to invest more than £44m in housing in Govanhill over the next four years. Councillor George Redmond: \"This is an impressive document and points to the way ahead in Govanhill.\" \"Significant sums are being invested in Govanhill and it is great news that part of that money will go towards new housing. \"The council has been working exceptionally hard to turn things around in Govanhill and we are starting to see real progress being made.\" He said that while the council was keen to work with all property owners in Govanhill, he warned the council would use power of compulsory purchase against those who refused to get on board with the plans.",
    "MGT": "About 350 new homes are set to be built in Glasgow's Govanhill area as part of a £6.4 million council initiative aimed at transforming the neighbourhood.\n\nThe ambitious housing development represents a significant investment in one of the city's most diverse communities, which has faced various social and economic challenges in recent years. Glasgow City Council announced the project as part of broader regeneration efforts designed to revitalise the area and improve living conditions for residents.\n\nThe new homes will provide much-needed housing stock in a district that has experienced high demand for quality accommodation. Council officials believe the development will help address housing shortages while contributing to the area's ongoing transformation.\n\nGovanhill has been the focus of extensive regeneration work in recent years, with local authorities and community groups working together to tackle issues including overcrowding, poor housing conditions, and antisocial behaviour. The new housing initiative builds on previous investments in the area, including improvements to local infrastructure and community facilities.\n\nThe £6.4 million funding package demonstrates the council's commitment to creating sustainable, long-term change in Govanhill. Officials expect the project to generate employment opportunities during construction while providing affordable housing options for families and individuals seeking to live in the area.\n\nLocal councillors have welcomed the announcement, emphasising that the new homes will help create a stronger, more stable community. The development is expected to complement existing regeneration efforts, including improvements to local parks, schools, and transport links.\n\nConstruction timelines and specific locations for the new homes are expected to be announced in the coming months, with planning applications set to be submitted to the council for approval."

    "prompt": "A cocktail of amino acids - the building blocks of proteins - is the latest contender in the age-old search for the elixir of life.",
    "HWT": "Scientists gave mice drinking water laced with three amino acids. They said the rodents lived significantly longer than other mice fed a normal diet. The research, reported in a scientific journal, has yet to be tried in people. The study leader said a large patient trial was needed to provide evidence to convince doctors. In experiments, middle-aged healthy male mice were given drinking water containing the amino acids leucine, isoleucine and valine. Dr Enzo Nisoli, of the University of Milan, and colleagues, said it increased the average lifespan of the mice by 12% and boosted their fitness and co-ordination. They wrote in their paper, published in Cell Metabolism: \"Our study offers a rationale for deeply exploring the role of amino acids in prevention and control of age-related disorders in humans.\" The amino acids - three of the 20 that make up proteins - have been shown to extend life span in yeast. However, the precise role of these amino acids in humans is unknown. They are used by bodybuilders to maintain muscle tissue and can be bought in health food stores and online.",
    "MGT": "A revolutionary cocktail of amino acids has emerged as the newest candidate in humanity's eternal quest for longevity, offering fresh hope in the search for life extension solutions.\n\nScientists have identified a specific combination of amino acids - the fundamental building blocks that form proteins in our bodies - that shows remarkable promise in potentially slowing the aging process. These essential compounds, which our bodies use to construct and repair tissues, appear to work synergistically when combined in precise proportions.\n\nThe amino acid mixture targets multiple pathways associated with cellular aging, including protein synthesis, DNA repair mechanisms, and metabolic function. Early research suggests this cocktail may help maintain muscle mass, support cognitive function, and enhance overall cellular health as we age.\n\nUnlike previous anti-aging approaches that focused on single compounds or interventions, this amino acid combination leverages the body's natural protein-building processes. Researchers believe this approach may be more sustainable and less likely to produce adverse side effects compared to synthetic alternatives.\n\nThe discovery builds upon decades of research into amino acid supplementation and its effects on human health. While clinical trials are still ongoing, preliminary results have generated significant excitement within the scientific community.\n\nThis breakthrough represents a shift toward using naturally occurring biological compounds rather than artificial substances in the pursuit of healthy aging and longevity enhancement."

    "prompt": "Barry Hawkins had a nightmare turnaround from his gripping victory over Ronnie O'Sullivan to trail Hong Kong's Marco Fu 7-1 in their World Championship quarter-final.",
    "HWT": "Hawkins won a draining final-frame thriller 13-12 over the pre-tournament favourite late on Monday night. But the Englishman was way below his best from the start against the world number 14 on Tuesday. He scored only 31 points as he lost the first five frames. Hawkins got on the board in frame six, but Fu easily won the last two frames to earn a six-frame advantage after the first session. The quarter-final tie is the best of 25 frames and the second session gets under way on Wednesday at 14:30 BST. Fu played with fluency and impressive cue ball control to take full advantage of some sloppy play by 2013 runner-up Hawkins - the only man to have made the semi-finals, when the Crucible switches to one table - in each of the last three years. But his chances of repeating that feat appear slim after being completely outplayed by London-based Fu, who recorded three half-centuries on his way to a 5-0 lead. World number 11 Hawkins took a scrappy sixth frame, but two half-centuries gave Fu frame seven and he rounded off the session with his sixth score of more than 50. The other afternoon match saw four-time champion John Higgins win four frames in a row to take a 5-3 lead in his all-Scottish meeting with Alan McManus. McManus, twice a World Championship quarter-finalist in the early 1990s, lost the opener but was then in imperious form as he secured a 3-1 mid-session interval lead with breaks of 114, 78 and 56. But the 45-year-old was out of sorts after the interval, appearing to be troubled by a neck problem. And Higgins, who has gone on to lift the title on the last three occasions he has reached the last eight at the Crucible, made the most of some decent chances to take control.

    "MGT": "Barry Hawkins endured a devastating collapse at the World Championship, plummeting from the euphoria of defeating Ronnie O'Sullivan to finding himself in an almost insurmountable 7-1 deficit against Hong Kong's Marco Fu in their quarter-final clash.\n\nThe Englishman, who had produced one of the tournament's most memorable performances to knock out the seven-time world champion O'Sullivan, appeared to suffer a complete mental and technical breakdown as Fu seized control of their best-of-25 encounter with ruthless efficiency.\n\nHawkins, 45, looked a shadow of the player who had celebrated wildly after his stunning victory over O'Sullivan just days earlier. The contrast could not have been starker as he struggled to find any rhythm against Fu, who capitalised on every opportunity presented to him with clinical precision.\n\nFu, making his first World Championship quarter-final appearance since 2006, showed no signs of nerves as he dominated the opening session. The 47-year-old Hong Kong veteran compiled several impressive breaks while Hawkins appeared increasingly frustrated with his own performance, missing straightforward shots and failing to establish any meaningful scoring opportunities.\n\nThe turnaround represents one of the most dramatic shifts in form seen at the Crucible Theatre. Hawkins had entered the match with confidence sky-high following his emotional triumph over O'Sullivan, a victory that had showcased his ability to perform under the most intense pressure. However, snooker's unforgiving nature was brutally exposed as he found himself facing what appears to be an impossible task.\n\nFu's commanding lead puts him within touching distance of reaching his first World Championship semi-final in 19 years. The former world number five has shown remarkable consistency throughout the tournament, and his experience is proving invaluable as he handles the pressure of being so close to snooker's biggest stage.\n\nFor Hawkins, the challenge now is to somehow find a way back into the match. History suggests that recovering from such a significant deficit is virtually impossible, but stranger things have happened at the World Championship.\n\nThe remaining frames of their encounter will determine whether Fu can complete what would be a remarkable comeback story or if Hawkins can produce another miracle turnaround."

    "HWT": "Police were trying to clear the blockade, which has cut supply lines of fuel and other goods, when protesters attacked a police post at Birgunj. Reports say the man was shot in the head and later died in hospital. The demonstrators, mainly from southern lowland minority groups, are angry about Nepal's new constitution. Communities from the lowlands believe that Nepal's proposed new provinces will lead to their political marginalisation. These concerns have led to violent clashes around Nepal since August, leaving dozens dead. The protester killed on Monday was identified as Ashish Kumar Ram, from Raxaul in the Indian state of Bihar, local officials said. Local police chief Rajubabu Shrestha told the BBC the protesters had entered Nepali territory from India, throwing stones. He said seven protesters and nine police had been injured. Nepal's Home Ministry Spokesman Laxmi Dhakal said two Indian nationals were arrested after they tried to obstruct police who were removing tents at the border. India said it was \"deeply concerned\" by events. \"Issues facing Nepal are political in nature and cannot be resolved by force. \"Causes underlying the present state of confrontation need to addressed by the government of Nepal credibly and effectively,\" the Indian foreign ministry said in a statement. Earlier, there were conflicting reports about the police crackdown. One report said police baton-charged demonstrators forcing them to remove the blockade, while another said authorities removed the tents of sleeping protesters and lined up trucks to pass through the crossing. Police official Hobindra Bogati told the Associated Press news agency that more than 200 trucks and other vehicles had crossed from Birgunj in Nepal to Raxaul and more were lining up. But, on the Indian side, thousands of trucks have not been able to cross over to Nepal for almost two months.  Reports said the trucks bringing fuel and other goods to Nepal were still blocked by Indian custom officials.",
    "MGT": "An Indian man was killed when Nepali police opened fire on hundreds of protesters who had blocked a crucial border crossing between Nepal and India, escalating tensions in the already strained relationship between the two South Asian neighbors.\n\nThe incident occurred as demonstrators gathered at the border checkpoint, effectively halting cross-border movement and trade between the countries. Witnesses reported that the situation deteriorated rapidly when police forces attempted to disperse the crowd, ultimately resorting to live ammunition.\n\nLocal authorities confirmed that one Indian national died from gunshot wounds sustained during the confrontation. Several other protesters were reportedly injured in the clash, though exact numbers remain unclear as medical teams continue to assess the casualties.\n\nThe protest was part of ongoing disputes that have periodically flared between communities on both sides of the Nepal-India border. These demonstrations often center around issues including territorial claims, trade regulations, and citizenship rights that affect people living in border regions.\n\nNepal and India share an open border stretching over 1,700 kilometers, with millions of people crossing daily for work, trade, and family visits. The porous boundary has been a source of both cooperation and conflict, as communities on either side maintain deep cultural and economic ties while sometimes finding themselves caught between competing national interests.\n\nThe shooting has drawn immediate condemnation from Indian officials, who have called for a thorough investigation into the circumstances surrounding the death. Indian authorities have also requested enhanced security measures to protect their citizens in the border areas.\n\nNepali officials defended the police action, stating that law enforcement was forced to use firearms after protesters became violent and refused to disperse despite repeated warnings. They emphasized that the border crossing needed to remain open for essential trade and movement.\n\nThe incident threatens to further complicate diplomatic relations between the two nations, which have experienced periodic tensions despite their historically close ties. Both countries have extensive trade relationships and share cultural connections, making border incidents particularly sensitive.\n\nLocal community leaders from both sides have called for calm and dialogue to prevent further escalation. The border crossing remains closed as authorities work to restore order and investigate the circumstances that led to the fatal shooting."

    "HWT": "A ship dragging its anchor on the seabed in the English Channel cut the three main internet cables to the Channel Islands on Monday. Repair work on the first cable is expected to take a week. Daragh McDermott from government owned JT said broadband speeds are expected to be slower during peak times. A second ship is on the way from France to repair the second cable and JT says the third cable will be repaired after that. Jersey's coastguard said there will be an investigation to see if the ship dropped anchor in a banned area. Owners of the King Arthur, Mediterranea di Navigazione, said they were investigating whether it was their ship that caused the problem. Three cables went one after the other on Monday with the first going at 16:00 GMT and the last by 21:00 GMT as the anchor was dragged across the seabed. Mr McDermott said: \"Thanks to the actions taken since the cables were cut, we have capacity in place to manage demand, although we have obviously lost spare capacity should further issues arise.\"",

JT, along with other regional telecommunications providers, has been working around the clock to restore full connectivity while coordinating repair efforts.\n\n\"Our priority is getting these critical infrastructure links operational as quickly as possible,\" a JT spokesperson said. The company has not disclosed the exact cause of the cable damage, though undersea cables can be affected by fishing activities, shipping anchors, or natural seabed movements.\n\nThe specialist vessel carries sophisticated equipment designed specifically for deep-sea cable repairs, including remotely operated vehicles capable of working at extreme depths. Repair operations typically take several days to complete, depending on water depth and weather conditions.\n\nWhile some services have been restored through alternative routing, full capacity will not return until all three cables are repaired.

Mr Lammy, Ms Jowell, Ms Abbott and Mr Wolmar all criticised the policy, with Ms Jowell saying that while it had been \"well intentioned\" it had been \"emblematically disastrous\" for Labour because it had caused people \"anxiety\" even if they weren't affected.",
    "MGT": "The race to become Labour's candidate for London mayor erupted into sharp disagreement last night as contenders faced off in their first public hustings over the contentious issue of airport expansion in the capital.\n\nThe debate highlighted fundamental divisions within the party about how to balance London's economic growth with environmental concerns and residents' quality of life. Candidates presented starkly different visions for the future of aviation infrastructure, setting the stage for what promises to be a heated selection process.\n\nSeveral hopefuls voiced strong opposition to any expansion of Heathrow Airport, citing environmental damage and the disproportionate impact on working-class communities in west London. They argued that Labour should champion residents over corporate interests, emphasizing the party's commitment to tackling climate change and air pollution that already affects millions of Londoners.\n\nHowever, other candidates defended the economic necessity of increased airport capacity, warning that London risks losing its status as a global financial hub without improved connectivity. They pointed to job creation and the need to compete with other European cities that continue expanding their aviation infrastructure.\n\nThe Gatwick expansion option also divided opinion, with some viewing it as a more environmentally acceptable alternative to Heathrow growth, while others dismissed it as inadequate for London's long-term needs. One candidate proposed instead focusing resources on improving rail links to existing airports rather than building new runways.\n\nClimate activists in the audience pressed all candidates on how their positions aligned with Labour's net-zero commitments. The responses revealed significant gaps in policy detail, with some struggling to reconcile pro-expansion stances with environmental pledges.\n\nThe airport debate overshadowed other policy areas including housing, transport, and policing, demonstrating its potential to become a defining issue in the selection contest. Local party members watching the hustings appeared split, mirroring broader divisions within London Labour about the direction the party should take.\n\nWith several more hustings planned across London's constituencies, candidates will need to refine their positions on airport expansion while appealing to a membership increasingly concerned about environmental issues. The winner will face the challenge of uniting the party behind a coherent aviation policy before confronting voters in the mayoral election."

    "prompt": "Profits at Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba have nearly tripled ahead of the firm's planned US stock market debut this autumn.",
    "HWT": "In a filing with US regulators, Alibaba said second-quarter profit was 12.3bn renminbi ($2bn; £1.2bn), compared to 4.3bn renminbi last year. The firm will list on the New York Stock Exchange later this year. It is expected to be the biggest internet stock offering since Facebook's in 2012. Many analysts believe that the company could raise over $20bn in its stock market debut, which is expected to happen in September. That would value the company at somewhere between $130bn and $150bn. Those hoping to invest in the firm - which controls the lion's share of China's rapidly expanding e-commerce market - were cheered by the increasing number of users accessing Alibaba's various sites via their smartphones. Monthly active mobile users increased to 188 million for the quarter, which ended on 30 June, an increase of 25 million from the prior quarter. And those users were increasingly eager to spend: Alibaba said mobile merchandise sales nearly quadrupled, and now make up nearly a third of all merchandise volume sold on the site. Founded in 1999 by Jack Ma, Alibaba controls several popular internet sites in China, including Tmall - where brands can sell their wares - and Taobao, the world's largest online shopping website.",
    "MGT": "Chinese e-commerce powerhouse Alibaba has reported a remarkable surge in profits, with earnings nearly tripling as the company prepares for what could be one of the largest initial public offerings in U.S. stock market history this autumn.\n\nThe Hangzhou-based company, founded by Jack Ma, saw its net income soar to unprecedented levels, demonstrating the robust growth of China's online retail market. This dramatic increase in profitability comes as Alibaba continues to dominate China's e-commerce landscape through its popular platforms Taobao and Tmall.\n\nIndustry analysts attribute this exceptional performance to the company's strong grip on China's expanding middle-class consumer base and its successful monetization strategies. The company has effectively capitalized on the growing trend of mobile shopping, with an increasing number of Chinese consumers making purchases through smartphones and tablets.\n\nThe timing of this profit announcement is particularly significant as Alibaba gears up for its highly anticipated Wall Street debut. Market experts suggest that this strong financial showing could help the company command a higher valuation in its upcoming IPO, which some estimate could raise more than $20 billion, potentially surpassing Facebook's 2012 offering.\n\nThe company's impressive financial results also reflect the broader growth of China's digital economy, as more businesses and consumers embrace online commerce. With its diverse ecosystem of digital services and payment solutions, Alibaba continues to strengthen its position as a leading force in global e-commerce."

    "HWT": "Joseph Phelps of Newbridge RFC cannot play for four years, making him the 13th Welsh rugby union player to currently be serving a ban. United Kingdom Anti-Doping says Phelps' use of nandrolone was detected in June 2015 and he is banned until July 2019. A summary of the tribunal published by Ukad said Phelps claimed he had taken Viagra and a \"test booster\" product to treat erectile dysfunction. He also claimed not to have taken anything \"for performance enhancement in sport\" but to treat symptoms he had suffered after sustaining a testicular injury. A report by Professor David Cowan, Director of the Drug Control Centre at King's College London, confirmed to the tribunal that \"the human body does not naturally produce nandrolone in measurable quantities and that nandrolone is a drug administered via deep intra-muscular injection\". Ukad legal chief Graham Arthur said athletes are \"solely responsible\" for banned substance found in their system. Arthur added: \"This case highlights that all athletes, regardless of level, must be aware, and understand, the risks to their sporting careers if they test positive. \"They must ensure they manage that risk at all times.\" Phelps' ban comes less than a month after Ukad chief executive Nicole Sapstead said a \"societal problem\" could be the cause of steroid drug use in Welsh rugby. Newbridge play in Swalec Championship.",
    "MGT": "A Welsh rugby player has received a suspension from the sport after testing positive for an anabolic steroid during routine drug testing procedures. The ban was announced following confirmation of the positive test result through the standard anti-doping protocols used in professional rugby.\n\nThe player, whose identity has not been disclosed pending further investigation, tested positive for a prohibited substance that falls under the World Anti-Doping Agency's list of banned performance-enhancing drugs. The steroid in question is commonly associated with muscle building and enhanced athletic performance, making its use strictly forbidden in competitive rugby.\n\nWelsh Rugby Union officials confirmed they are cooperating fully with the investigation and emphasized their commitment to maintaining the integrity of the sport. The organization has a zero-tolerance policy regarding performance-enhancing drugs and regularly conducts random testing of players at all levels.\n\nThe length of the suspension will depend on several factors, including whether this is a first offense and the specific circumstances surrounding the positive test. Under current anti-doping regulations, players can face bans ranging from several months to multiple years, depending on the severity of the violation.\n\nThis incident highlights the ongoing challenges faced by rugby authorities in combating the use of performance-enhancing substances in the sport. The Welsh Rugby Union has invested significantly in education programs designed to inform players about the risks and consequences of drug use.\n\nThe player has the right to request analysis of their B sample and can appeal the decision through the appropriate channels. Further details regarding the case are expected to be released as the investigation progresses."

Awel Deg care home was shut in February 2014, making 40 employees redundant. The council said it was working with Mr Garthwaite. Awel Deg was closed following the suspension of 11 members of staff and concerns about standards of care. The council said in May 2014 the facility would re-open as a dementia home in spring 2015, but a spokesman said on Wednesday that this could not happen until Mr Garthwaite's investigation was complete. Jeff Baker, regional organiser for Unison, said the union had written to the council complaining about the wait. \"It is very disappointing,\" he said. \"Unison understands that Mr Garthwaite cannot complete his report because the council has not taken steps to provide answers to key matters that Mr Garthwaite has put forward.\" A council spokesman said it was aware of Unison's comments. \"The council is working with Tony Garthwaite... to ensure that he has access to all the relevant information that he requires in order that he can complete his investigation,\" the spokesman said.",

Union officials claim the local authority has been unresponsive to requests for information and has not provided adequate transparency during the investigative process.\n\nThe residential home's closure has sparked significant concern within the local community, with questions raised about the decision-making process and whether proper procedures were followed.

They're a real threat at set-plays also. \"We know we need to bring the type of performance that we've had against them here in Dingwall over the last year or so. It's going to take something similar again. \"Their front four are very potent and they've got lots of goals in them and generally most of their goals come from that. \"You need to try and nullify that major threat that they have in that front four positions.\" County drew 1-1 with Rangers at Ibrox in last weekend's Premiership match, having led 1-0 at the break. And McIntyre's assistant Billy Dodds told Radio Scotland's Sportsound: \"The Rangers game on Saturday, it's the best first 45 minutes we've played at any big ground, whether it's Aberdeen, Celtic, Rangers. \"We really deserved to probably be a couple in front but it wasn't to be. \"We've been a bit inconsistent in the league this year.

The experienced manager has been particularly impressed with his team's ability to elevate their performance levels when facing higher-profile opponents.\n\n\"We've shown time and again that we can compete with anyone on our day,\" McIntyre said during his pre-match press conference. \"The players have demonstrated real character and quality in these big occasions, and I'm confident they can do it again on Saturday.\"\n\nThe Staggies have built a reputation for being dangerous opponents in cup competitions, often producing their best football when the stakes are highest. McIntyre pointed to previous performances against established Premiership sides as evidence of his team's capability to cause upsets and progress in knockout tournaments.\n\nAberdeen, under their current management, will arrive in Dingwall as favourites for the tie, but McIntyre is keen to ensure his players are not overawed by their opponents' reputation. The County boss has been working with his squad throughout the week to ensure they approach the match with the right mentality and tactical preparation.\n\n\"Cup football is different from league football,\" McIntyre explained. \"It's about who wants it more on the day, who's prepared to dig deeper and fight for every ball. We've got players who understand that mentality and thrive in these environments.\"\n\nThe manager has been particularly pleased with his team's recent form and believes the timing of the fixture could work in their favour. Several key players have returned to fitness, providing McIntyre with additional options as he finalizes his team selection for the weekend.\n\nVictoria Park is expected to be buzzing with anticipation as supporters prepare to back their team against the Premiership opposition. McIntyre acknowledged the importance of the home crowd and believes the atmosphere can provide his players with an extra edge.\n\n\"Our fans have been fantastic all season, and I know they'll be right behind us again on Saturday,\" he added. \"That support can be the difference in tight matches like this.\"\n\nWith kick-off approaching, McIntyre's message to his players remains clear: embrace the challenge, trust in their abilities, and deliver when it matters most."

    "HWT": "The incident happened near Byfield 2,000ft (610m) over the skies of Northamptonshire, in May. The pilot of the Van's RV-6 two-seater, single engine craft had to take evasive action, and the drone passed down the left-hand side of the aircraft. He reported the near-miss, but the drone could not be seen on radar and the operator could not be traced. The UK Airprox Board, set up to enhance air safety in the UK, branded the risk rating a \"category B\", meaning the aircraft's security was compromised. The pilot described the drone as a \"red and yellow, three-rotor drone\", which was the \"type that can be easily bought in shops and not a commercial surveillance type vehicle\". The report states the drone operator should not have been operating the drone at such a high altitude. It says: \"Because the drone was being operated at an altitude it should not have been, the reported drone was flown into conflict with the RV6. \"Although there was no radar data to measure the exact separation, the Board thought it was clear from the pilot's report that this was a fairly close encounter, and they assessed the risk as Category B.\"",
    "MGT": "A light aircraft experienced a dangerous near-miss with a commercial drone that investigators have determined compromised the safety of the flight, according to a newly released report.\n\nThe incident occurred when the drone operated too close to the aircraft's flight path, creating a potentially hazardous situation that could have resulted in a collision. Aviation safety officials launched an investigation immediately following the reported encounter to assess the circumstances and determine what safety protocols may have been violated.\n\nInvestigators found that the drone was operating in airspace without proper authorization and failed to maintain adequate separation from manned aircraft. The pilot of the light aircraft reported spotting the unmanned vehicle at close range, forcing evasive action to avoid contact.\n\nThe findings highlight growing concerns about drone operations near airports and established flight corridors. Commercial drone operators are required to follow strict guidelines regarding altitude limits, no-fly zones, and coordination with air traffic control systems.\n\nSafety experts emphasize that such incidents underscore the critical importance of proper drone registration and adherence to federal aviation regulations. Unauthorized drone flights in controlled airspace pose significant risks to both commercial and private aircraft operations.\n\nThe investigation report recommends enhanced enforcement of existing drone regulations and improved education for commercial operators about safe flight practices. Aviation authorities are reviewing current protocols to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future and ensure the continued safety of all aircraft sharing the nation's airspace."

Tim Lezard, from Stroud Labour Party, which organised the campaign, said it was \"a local service that people need\". But Paul Jennings, from Gloucestershire Care Services NHS Trust, said keeping it open was \"not practical\". Mr Jennings said: \"We're not in a position to provide an overnight service at Stroud and Cirencester minor injury units, that's why we've had to have so many closures over the last few months. \"We simply cannot recruit the staff to work those shifts. They don't want to do it, there are very few patients. It's potentially quite de-skilling and demoralising for the nurses who would be working there.  It's just not a practical proposition.\" Mr Lezard said: \"The danger is now that people will have to go to Gloucester and it is already overstretched in A & E there.\" There are eight minor injury units in Gloucestershire. Cirencester and Stroud hospitals currently offer a 24 hour service. Other units, which are not open overnight, are based in Dilke Memorial Hospital, Lydney and District Hospital, North Cotswolds Hospital, Tewkesbury Hospital, Vale Community Hospital and Tetbury Hospital.

    "MGT": "A petition demanding that a hospital's minor injuries unit maintain its 24-hour service is set to be presented to Gloucestershire county councillors, highlighting growing community concerns over healthcare accessibility.\n\nThe petition comes amid ongoing discussions about potential changes to the operating hours of the minor injuries unit, which currently provides round-the-clock emergency care for patients with non-life-threatening conditions. Local residents and healthcare advocates have mobilized to preserve the service, arguing that reduced hours would significantly impact patient care and emergency response capabilities.\n\nCommunity members have expressed particular concern about the potential impact on vulnerable populations, including elderly residents and families with young children who may require urgent medical attention outside traditional daytime hours. The 24-hour service has been credited with reducing pressure on larger emergency departments while providing essential care for conditions such as minor fractures, cuts requiring stitches, and other urgent but non-critical medical issues.\n\nSupporters of the petition argue that maintaining 24-hour access is crucial for rural communities where alternative emergency services may be located significant distances away. They contend that any reduction in hours could force patients to travel further for treatment or wait longer for care, potentially worsening medical conditions.\n\nThe presentation to county councillors represents a formal opportunity for community voices to be heard in the decision-making process. Healthcare officials have not yet announced any definitive plans regarding changes to the unit's operating schedule, but the petition demonstrates significant public investment in maintaining current service levels.\n\nCounty councillors will need to weigh community demands against budgetary constraints and resource allocation priorities as they consider the future of the minor injuries unit's operating hours."

Riots, looting and violence shook the city in the days following the black 25-year-old's death. The city will propose the settlement to its Board of Estimates on Wednesday. Gray was in the back of a prisoner transport van when he was injured. His death is of one of several involving black Americans and police which has spurred national debate, unrest and various social justice movements. Baltimore police have admitted he was not secured by a seatbelt, as required by law, and he was denied medical attention while in the van. The settlement would \"resolve all civil claims related to the City of Baltimore, the Baltimore Police Department, individual Baltimore Police offers and any other persons or institutions who might be deemed responsible for the death of Mr Gray,\" according to a statement from Baltimore Mayor Stephanie-Rawlings Blake. The payment does not resolve any \"factual disputes\" surrounding his death and does not admit liability or fault on the part of the city or the police department, the statement added. It is not a judgement on the guilt or innocence of the officers facing trial, said Ms Rawlings-Blake.

Gray, a 25-year-old Black man, died from severe spinal cord injuries sustained while in police custody in April 2015.\n\nGray was arrested in the Sandtown-Winchester neighborhood and placed in the back of a police van without being secured with a seatbelt. During the transport to the police station, Gray suffered fatal injuries that included a severed spinal cord and crushed voice box. His death became a symbol of police brutality and racial injustice, triggering days of protests that eventually escalated into riots.\n\nThe incident led to charges against six Baltimore police officers involved in Gray's arrest and transport. However, the prosecutions ultimately failed, with three officers acquitted at trial and charges dropped against the remaining three.\n\nBaltimore Mayor Brandon Scott called the settlement \"an important step toward healing\" while acknowledging that no amount of money can bring Gray back to his family. The mayor emphasized the city's ongoing commitment to police reform and community relations.\n\nGray's family attorney expressed satisfaction with the settlement, stating it provides some measure of justice for their loss. The attorney noted that the family hopes the agreement will contribute to meaningful changes in police practices and accountability.\n\nThe proposed settlement comes as Baltimore continues to grapple with police reform efforts and community trust issues. The city has implemented various initiatives aimed at improving police-community relations since Gray's death, including enhanced training programs and revised use-of-force policies.\n\nThe Board of Estimates is expected to vote on the settlement proposal next week.

However, Minister Arce's recent comments suggest that the national government may not consider the results binding.\n\n\"While we respect the democratic process, we must consider the broader economic interests of the nation alongside local concerns,\" Arce stated during a press conference in Bogotá. \"The legal framework surrounding such referendums is complex, and their authority in determining national resource policy remains an open question.\"\n\nThe mining project in question, which would become one of the largest gold extraction operations in Latin America, has been promoted as a significant source of employment and economic development for the region. Multinational mining corporations have invested heavily in preliminary exploration and have expressed disappointment at the referendum's outcome.\n\nEnvironmental activists and local community leaders have responded with alarm to the Minister's statements. \"The people have spoken clearly,\" said Maria Gonzalez, a community organizer from Cajamarca. \"To ignore this referendum would be to undermine the democratic principles that our constitution guarantees.\"\n\nLegal experts note that the situation highlights ongoing tensions between Colombia's decentralization policies and national resource management. The constitution provides communities with certain rights regarding their territories, but also establishes that subsoil resources belong to the state.\n\nThe dispute occurs against a backdrop of increasing environmental activism throughout Latin America, where communities are increasingly challenging extractive industries they believe threaten water sources, agricultural land, and traditional ways of life.\n\nAs the controversy unfolds, both sides are preparing for what could become a protracted legal battle that may ultimately require intervention from Colombia's Constitutional Court to determine whether local referendum results can effectively block nationally-approved mining projects."

    "HWT": "Centre-back Fonte, 32, helped his country to Euro 2016 victory in July and has been linked with a move to Manchester United. \"It is important to keep Jose Fonte at Southampton,\" Puel said. \"He is a very important player for the team, a good player and I don't see that it is a possibility for him to leave us.\" Puel, who joined the club as successor to Ronald Koeman in June, believes many players in his squad will attract interest during the transfer window. \"It's no different for Jose Fonte than it is for other players,\" he said. \"I'm enjoying sitting down and working with this squad. \"The qualities are there, but there is also the spirit and attitude, which is encouraging for the future of Southampton.\" Puel will take charge of his first Premier League game at home to Watford on Saturday. The former Nice, Monaco and Lyon manager will be without England left-back Ryan Bertrand through injury, but is set to use summer signing Nathan Redmond in an attacking role. Puel said: \"Last season at Norwich, he often played out wide, but I think he is a very good striker. He can make different things happen. It's a good surprise for me, because he has real potential.\"",
    "MGT": "Southampton's new manager Claude Puel has moved quickly to address speculation surrounding captain Jose Fonte's future, confirming that the Portugal international defender will remain at St. Mary's Stadium for the upcoming season.\n\nThe French tactician, who was appointed as the Saints' new boss following Ronald Koeman's departure to Everton, made the announcement during his first press conference since taking charge of the Premier League club. Fonte had been linked with moves away from the south coast throughout the summer transfer window, with several top-flight clubs reportedly monitoring his situation.\n\n\"Jose is our captain and an important player for this club,\" Puel stated firmly. \"He has shown great leadership qualities and his experience will be vital as we look to build on last season's achievements. There was never any doubt in my mind that he would be staying with us.\"\n\nThe 32-year-old centre-back has been a consistent performer for Southampton since joining from Crystal Palace in 2010, making over 200 appearances for the club. His commanding presence at the heart of the defense has been instrumental in the Saints' rise from League One to established Premier League status.\n\nFonte's international credentials were further enhanced during Portugal's successful European Championship campaign this summer, where he played a key role in helping his country claim their first major tournament victory.\n\nWith Fonte's future now secured, Puel can focus on finalizing his squad preparations ahead of Southampton's Premier League opener, as the club looks to continue their impressive trajectory under new management."

    "HWT": "Trailing 24-15 at the break, Newcastle scored four tries in 18 second-half minutes to turn the game around. Scrum-half Takulua crossed the line three times and also added another nine points with his boot off the tee. Northampton, who earned a bonus point of their own with four tries, were undone by a series of defensive and handling errors in the second half. A second successive home win for Newcastle lifts them above Northampton to seventh and just a point behind sixth-placed Harlequins. Northampton have now lost their past two Premiership matches to fall to eighth and are without an away win in six games in all competitions. Jim Mallinder's side made a terrific start with two tries inside the opening five minutes from Ken Pisi and Jamie Gibson. Harry Mallinder's score in the corner seemingly put them in charge at the break despite Takulua and Sean Robinson crossing for the hosts. But a lightning restart from Newcastle saw Rob Vickers and a Takulua brace change the complexion of the game within 10 minutes. Falcons went on to inflict further damage through hooker Kyle Cooper before Mikey Haywood kept Saints in the hunt, although Mark Wilson's late score from a rolling maul settled the affair. Newcastle: Tait; Goneva, Waldouck, Socino, Sinoti; Hodgson, Takulua; Vickers, Cooper, Welsh, Green, Robinson, Wilson, Welch (capt), Latu. Replacements: Lawson, Harris, Wilson, Fonua, Olmstead, Egerton, Delany, Watson. Northampton: Tuala; K. Pisi, Tuitavake, Mallinder, Foden (capt); Myler, Groom; A. Waller, Haywood, Brookes, Ratuniyarawa, Day, Gibson, Clark, Harrison. Replacements: Clare, E. Waller, Hill, Paterson, Nutley, Dickson, Hutchinson, Pablo Estelles.",
    "MGT": "Sonatane Takulua produced a scintillating hat-trick performance as Newcastle secured a commanding victory over Northampton at Kingston Park, delivering one of the most impressive displays of the season in front of their home supporters.\n\nThe Tongan scrum-half was in irrepressible form throughout the encounter, exploiting gaps in the Northampton defense with his trademark pace and vision. His first try came midway through the opening period when he capitalized on quick ball from a lineout, darting through a narrow channel to touch down near the posts.\n\nNewcastle's dominance was evident from the early exchanges, with their forward pack establishing superiority at the breakdown and creating the platform for their backs to flourish. The home side's attacking intent was clear as they moved the ball with pace and precision, stretching the Northampton defense across the width of the pitch.\n\nTakulua's second score arrived just before halftime, as he showed excellent anticipation to intercept a loose pass and race clear from inside his own half. The crowd at Kingston Park erupted as the diminutive playmaker crossed the whitewash, extending Newcastle's advantage heading into the break.\n\nThe Saints struggled to contain Newcastle's relentless attacking pressure throughout the second half, with their discipline wavering under the sustained assault. Penalty concessions in crucial areas allowed the home side to maintain territorial advantage and continue building phases in dangerous positions.\n\nTakulua completed his treble with twenty minutes remaining, finishing off a sweeping move that showcased Newcastle's attacking prowess. The try was a testament to the team's collective effort, with forwards and backs combining seamlessly to create the opportunity for their star performer to claim the match ball.\n\nNorthampton showed glimpses of their quality in isolated moments but were ultimately overwhelmed by Newcastle's intensity and execution. Their usually reliable set-piece struggled against Newcastle's aggressive approach, limiting their ability to establish any sustained attacking momentum.\n\nThe comprehensive victory will provide significant confidence for Newcastle as they continue their campaign, with Takulua's exceptional individual performance highlighting the depth of talent within their squad and their ability to produce match-winning displays when required."

    "prompt": "Anyone lucky enough to have a £50 note in their wallet or purse will find it is the only banknote made of paper in a few years.",
    "HWT": "The Bank of England has announced that the next design of the £20 note will be plastic. The new £20 note, entering circulation in 2020, will follow the polymer £5 and £10 notes. Consumers will be able to get their hands on the new plastic £5 note, the first in the polymer series, from 2016. This will feature the image of Sir Winston Churchill. The Bank argues that the polymer notes stay cleaner and are more secure than cotton paper notes, which have been used for more than 100 years. The £5 polymer note will enter circulation in the autumn of 2016, followed by the Jane Austen plastic £10 note a year later. The Bank said that the decision for the £20 note to also be made from polymer came after \"extensive research into the developments in security features\". On a more practical level for many consumers, it will also survive a spin in the washing machine. A bank committee is considering which character will appear on the new £20 note. It received 29,701 nominations from the public after it announced it wanted to celebrate an artist on the note. Some 592 eligible visual artists are being considered for the honour. The final decision will be made by the Bank's governor, Mark Carney. Favourites include the sculptor and artist Barbara Hepworth, the author Beatrix Potter and fashion designer Alexander McQueen. Whoever wins will replace the economist Adam Smith on the current £20 note. The next £50 could also be made of plastic, but it will be some time before that decision is made. The latest version of the note, featuring Matthew Boulton and James Watt, only entered circulation in November 2011. Clydesdale Bank in Scotland has issued a limited number of polymer notes. In 1999, Northern Bank of Northern Ireland issued a polymer £5 commemorative note celebrating the year 2000. A plastic note was introduced in the Isle of Man in 1983 but was withdrawn in 1988 owing to problems with the ink.",
    "MGT": "Anyone fortunate enough to possess a £50 note in their wallet or purse will discover it represents the final paper banknote in circulation within the next few years, as the Bank of England continues its transition to polymer currency.\n\nThe £50 note, featuring mathematician and computer pioneer Alan Turing, remains the sole paper denomination following the successful introduction of polymer versions for smaller denominations. The £5 note made the switch to polymer in 2016, followed by the £10 note in 2017 and the £20 note in 2020, leaving the highest denomination as the last holdout in traditional cotton-paper construction.\n\nBank of England officials have indicated that plans are underway to eventually convert the £50 note to the more durable polymer material, though no definitive timeline has been announced. The transition represents part of a broader modernization effort designed to enhance security features while extending the lifespan of banknotes in circulation.\n\nPolymer banknotes offer significant advantages over their paper counterparts, including superior resistance to dirt, moisture, and general wear from handling. The plastic-based notes typically last two and a half times longer than paper versions, reducing replacement costs and environmental impact over time. Enhanced security features embedded within polymer notes also make counterfeiting considerably more difficult.\n\nThe £50 note itself has an interesting history, being the least frequently used denomination in everyday transactions. Many retailers and businesses often refuse to accept £50 notes due to security concerns and the inconvenience of providing change for such large amounts. Despite this limited circulation, the note remains legal tender and continues to serve specific purposes in higher-value transactions.\n\nFinancial experts suggest that holders of paper £50 notes need not rush to exchange them, as the Bank of England typically provides extended transition periods when introducing new designs or materials. Previous changeovers have allowed several years for the gradual withdrawal of older versions from circulation.\n\nThe eventual conversion of the £50 note to polymer will mark the completion of the Bank of England's currency modernization program, bringing all circulating denominations under the same advanced material standard. This transformation reflects broader trends in global currency design, with numerous countries adopting polymer banknotes for their enhanced durability and security properties.\n\nUntil then, paper £50 notes remain a curious reminder of traditional banknote production methods."

Gale and Adam Milner extended the lead before Ryan Brierley hit back. Two more tries from Gale in a 24-point contribution and a Monaghan treble followed as Tigers dominated. While Lee Gaskell added a further consolation try for Huddersfield in the second half, it did little more than add a semblance of respectability to the scoreline as they became the latest club to suffer a heavy loss at the Jungle. Castleford have scored at least 43 points in each of their first four home games in Super League this season. However, they were left to bemoan a series of handling errors after Hinchcliffe's try put Huddersfield ahead. That was before Roberts scooped up a neat grubber kick by Gale to help put the hosts ahead after 21 minutes. Huddersfield then saw their restart go out on the full, allowing Roberts the chance to quickly play provider for Webster as Tigers piled the points on. Gale gave Daryl Powell's side the ideal start to the second half, crossing for the first of his tries after just 30 seconds, as Castleford went on to win big to remain top. They are level on points with Leeds Rhinos, who beat Wigan 26-18 in Friday's other Super League game.

However, the floodgates opened after the interval as Castleford's attacking prowess overwhelmed their opponents in spectacular fashion.\n\nGale, the Tigers' influential halfback, orchestrated the demolition with a masterful second-half hat-trick that showcased his clinical finishing and tactical awareness. The England international's treble included two opportunistic tries from close range and a brilliant solo effort that left the Giants defense scrambling.\n\nMonaghan matched his teammate's heroics with an equally impressive hat-trick of his own, capitalizing on the space created by Castleford's relentless pressure. The veteran winger's experience proved invaluable as he crossed the whitewash three times in quick succession, each score highlighting his predatory instincts in the attacking zone.\n\nThe comprehensive victory extends Castleford's lead at the Super League summit and sends a clear message to their championship rivals. Their second-half transformation from competitive contest to one-sided affair demonstrated the ruthless efficiency that has characterized their campaign.\n\nFor Huddersfield, the heavy defeat compounds their struggles in what has been a challenging season. The Giants showed glimpses of promise in the first half but were ultimately overwhelmed by Castleford's superior firepower and tactical execution.\n\nThe contrast between the two halves could not have been starker. Where the opening period suggested a closely fought encounter, the final forty minutes belonged entirely to the visitors as they ran riot against increasingly demoralized opposition.\n\nCastleford's ability to turn the screw when opportunities arose will give coach confidence ahead of the business end of the season. With performances like this, they are establishing themselves as the team to beat in the race for Super League glory.\n\nThe result leaves Huddersfield with significant work ahead as they seek to arrest their slide down the table."

    "HWT": "He was responding to a question by MP Dominic Grieve about the Heathrow spur. Mr McLoughlin said: \"I would now like to make clear that we do not intend to build the spur as part of Phase 1 or 2 of the HS2 scheme\". HS2 is a planned high-speed rail network from London to Birmingham, Manchester and Leeds. Previously the government had said any decision about the Heathrow spur would be delayed until the Davies Commission's report on future UK airport capacity had been completed. Responding to Mr Grieve's written Parliamentary question, the minister cited the Airports Commission review findings - published in November - which \"indicated that an HS2 spur is highly unlikely to be necessary to support any expansion of Heathrow airport\". Nick Hurd, Conservative MP for Ruislip, Northwood and Pinner tweeted he was \"delighted\" the government had dropped the idea and gave \"credit to ministers for listening to our argument\". He said the best way of connecting passengers to Heathrow was via Old Oak Common. He said it also simplified the case for extending the HS2 tunnel to protect Ickenham and Colne Valley. Paul Prentice, assistant news editor at Rail magazine said it was a \"very sensible decision. Bearing in mind there is already a spur tunnel to Heathrow and another western link being built\". Campaigner Lottie Jones from Hillingdon Against HS2 said the group was \"delighted\" with the decision but cautious that it was not \"just a pre-election sweetener\" that might be revoked.",
    "MGT": "Plans for a direct rail connection between Heathrow Airport and the HS2 high-speed railway network have been definitively rejected by Transport Minister Patrick McLoughlin, dealing a significant blow to hopes of improved connectivity to Britain's busiest airport.\n\nThe decision marks the end of years of speculation about integrating Heathrow into the ambitious high-speed rail project, which aims to connect London with major cities across the Midlands and North. Aviation industry leaders and business groups had long advocated for the Heathrow link as a way to enhance the airport's accessibility and boost the UK's competitiveness as a global hub.\n\nMcLoughlin cited cost concerns and technical complexities as primary factors behind the ruling. The proposed connection would have required substantial engineering challenges, including tunneling beneath existing infrastructure and coordination with ongoing airport expansion plans. Officials estimated the additional costs could have run into billions of pounds, significantly inflating the already substantial HS2 budget.\n\nThe announcement has drawn criticism from aviation stakeholders who argue that excluding Heathrow undermines the strategic value of the high-speed network. They contend that seamless connections between major airports and rail infrastructure are essential for maintaining London's status as a leading international destination.\n\nAirport operators expressed disappointment but indicated they would continue pursuing alternative transport improvements. Current rail connections to Heathrow include the Heathrow Express and London Underground services, though these operate at conventional speeds.\n\nThe HS2 project, already facing scrutiny over rising costs and construction delays, will now proceed without the airport component. Passengers traveling between Heathrow and northern destinations served by HS2 will need to continue using existing transport links or make connections through central London stations."

    "HWT": "Profit was 33.6bn yen ($278m; Â£182m) in the three months to September, compared with a 136bn yen loss a year earlier. The results are big turnaround for the firm that has seen years of losses and undergone a restructuring, which has resulted in job cuts and asset sales. Its first half restructuring charges were down 35% at 15.7bn yen. But sales of its smartphones continued to decline. \"In the Mobile Communications segment, sales decreased primarily due to a significant decrease in smartphone unit sales resulting from a strategic decision not to pursue scale in order to improve profitability,\" the company said. Overall, its sales fell 0.5% to 1.8tn yen despite the uptick in demand for PS4 games and image sensors. Expecting to sell more PS4 consoles, Sony left its forecast for earnings for the year ending in March 2016 unchanged. \"Sales are expected to be higher than the July forecast primarily due to an expected increase in PS4 hardware unit sales and PS4 software sales,\" the company said. The earnings report comes a day after Sony announced that it would take over Toshiba's image sensor business.",
    "MGT": "Sony Corp. reported a return to profitability in the second quarter of its fiscal year, marking a significant turnaround for the Japanese technology conglomerate. The company posted a net profit after experiencing losses in previous quarters, with the recovery largely attributed to robust sales performance from its PlayStation 4 gaming console.\n\nThe gaming division emerged as a key driver of Sony's financial recovery, with PlayStation 4 sales exceeding expectations during the quarter. Strong demand for the console and its accompanying software titles contributed substantially to the company's improved bottom line. Industry analysts noted that the gaming sector's performance helped offset weaker results from other business segments.\n\nSony's entertainment and gaming operations have increasingly become central to the company's overall strategy, as traditional electronics markets face mounting pressure from competition and changing consumer preferences. The PlayStation brand continues to maintain its position as a leading force in the global gaming market, competing effectively against rivals Microsoft and Nintendo.\n\nThe positive quarterly results represent a welcome development for Sony shareholders, who have endured periods of uncertainty as the company navigated challenging market conditions across multiple business segments. Management expressed cautious optimism about maintaining momentum in the gaming division while working to improve performance in other areas of the business. The results underscore the importance of Sony's gaming portfolio to its overall financial health."

It was a disappointing day for the Williams sisters after older sister Venus withdrew with an arm injury. The 36-year-old beat New Zealand wildcard Jade Lewis 7-6 (7-2) 6-2 and was due to play Japan's Naomi Osaka in the second round later on Wednesday but pulled out before the match. Tournament director Karl Budge said that the seven-time Grand Slam winner \"wasn't able to serve as she would like to and at the level that we have come to expect from Venus and unfortunately that has taken her away from the tournament this year\".

    "HWT": "Charlie Elphicke, Conservative MP for Dover and Deal, said Shepway District Council supported the plans for a smaller lorry park at Westenhanger. The council's leader had previously branded a proposed 3,300-space lorry park as \"bonkers\". Lorries are allowed to park on the M20 when there are delays at Channel ports. The proposed lorry park is aimed at relieving pressure caused by Operation Stack, when trucks are allowed to queue due to delays at Channel Tunnel and ferry ports. Mr Elphicke said: \"We've had major problems in Dover in recent months because of the level of gridlock, which is a weekly occurrence. \"We need a long term solution. There is a site near Folkestone which could be the site with up to 1,000 lorry parking spaces. \"[Shepway] District Council is supportive and I'm making the case it should be advance check-in, before lorries go down to the Eastern Docks. \"There would be 1,000 spaces in the Eastern Docks and 1,000 spaces near Folkestone which would be enough capacity not to cause gridlock in Dover.\" A spokeswoman said Shepway council was \"driving plans\" for a lorry park with about 1,000 spaces. She said the authority was looking at land near Westenhanger and was talking to local land owners. Councillor Paul Carter, Conservative leader of Kent County Council, said problems arising from Operation Stack were \"intolerable\" to the people of Kent. He said: \"We need national government to fund what is needed to get the private sector to operate those lorry parks. \"Recently, the government introduced charging for foreign lorries using our roads, and I believe a substantial amount of the money should be used to fund these lorry parks.\"",
    "MGT": "A new 1,000-space lorry park designed to tackle chronic congestion problems on the M20 and in Dover has received backing from local residents and businesses, according to the area's Member of Parliament.\n\nThe proposed facility aims to address the persistent issue of heavy goods vehicles queuing along the motorway and through Dover's streets, particularly during periods of cross-Channel travel disruption. These traffic bottlenecks have long been a source of frustration for both commercial drivers and local communities.\n\nThe MP emphasized that the project has garnered significant support from constituents who have experienced firsthand the impact of lorry congestion on daily life. Local businesses have particularly welcomed the initiative, citing how current traffic problems affect their operations and customer access.\n\nDover's strategic position as Britain's closest port to continental Europe means it handles millions of passengers and thousands of commercial vehicles annually. However, this vital role has come at a cost to the surrounding area, with regular traffic chaos affecting residents and local infrastructure.\n\nThe lorry park would provide a dedicated space for drivers to wait during busy periods or when ferry services are disrupted, rather than using local roads as an impromptu parking area. This approach mirrors successful models used at other major transport hubs across Europe.\n\nPlanning considerations for the facility include ensuring adequate amenities for drivers during extended waits, including rest areas, catering facilities, and basic services. Environmental assessments are also being conducted to minimize any impact on the local landscape.\n\nTransport officials believe the new facility could significantly reduce journey times for regular commuters and improve air quality in the immediate area by preventing idling vehicles from clogging residential streets. The project represents part of a broader strategy to modernize Britain's freight infrastructure.\n\nWhile specific timelines for construction have not been finalized, preliminary discussions with planning authorities are already underway. The MP noted that securing funding and navigating the planning process remain key priorities for bringing this much-needed infrastructure project to fruition."

    "HWT": "The England coach has picked United's Marcus Rashford, 19, in his squad. The teenage striker will now miss the Under-21 European Championship this summer - something Mourinho wanted. \"I'm not in a position where I can make decisions to keep people happy. I'm not going to achieve that,\" said Southgate. \"The key is not the relationship with Jose, it's the relationship with Marcus. I didn't speak to him [Mourinho] about it. I let him know where I was heading at the end.\" Mourinho said last month Rashford should not go to the Euros as \"it does not make a lot of sense to drop levels\". The FA previously indicated young players needed tournament experience. Rashford has instead been called up for the World Cup qualifier against Scotland on 10 June and the friendly against France three days later. He played 58 games for United and England this season, scoring 11 goals, having broken into his club's first-team last term. Just four months into his first professional season in February 2016, he was selected for Euro 2016 by England manager Roy Hodgson and has gone on to win eight caps. Rashford led the line in United's Europa League final win over Ajax and came on in the EFL Cup final triumph over Southampton. Southgate said he \"wants a good working relationship with the clubs\" but has to make decisions \"that are right for England\". The former international defender added: \"I have got to make decisions that are right for England seniors long term, I'm always mindful of what is right for the players. \"Respectfully, none of the managers are going to be around in 10 years, or it's very, very unlikely, and I think people like Marcus Rashford will be. \"So there's always going to be some collision at some point on that and some disagreement on that.\"",
    "MGT": "England manager Gareth Southgate has dismissed concerns about keeping Manchester United boss Jose Mourinho satisfied with his team selections, stating it would be \"fairly difficult\" to please the Portuguese manager while maintaining his commitment to making decisions that benefit the national team.\n\nThe comments come amid ongoing tension between club and international managers over player selection and workload management. Mourinho has been vocal about his frustrations with players returning from international duty fatigued or injured, particularly during crucial periods of the domestic season.\n\nSouthgate, however, remains resolute in his approach to squad selection and match preparation. \"I'm not going to stop making decisions that are right for England,\" the England boss declared. \"My responsibility is to the national team and to give us the best possible chance of success in international competitions.\"\n\nThe relationship between club and country has long been a delicate balancing act in football. Managers like Mourinho often express concerns about their players' fitness levels following international breaks, especially when key fixtures await their return. The United manager has previously criticized the scheduling of international matches and the intensity of training sessions conducted by national team coaches.\n\nSouthgate's pragmatic stance reflects the broader challenges facing international managers who must navigate the competing interests of club bosses while building cohesive national squads. The England manager has consistently prioritized his tactical vision and team development over individual club concerns, a philosophy that has contributed to England's recent tournament successes.\n\nThe tension highlights the ongoing debate within football about player welfare and the demanding calendar that sees top players featuring in domestic leagues, European competitions, and international fixtures throughout the year. While club managers focus on their immediate competitive needs, international bosses must consider long-term development and tournament preparation.\n\nSouthgate's firm position demonstrates his confidence in his methods and his unwillingness to compromise his strategic plans based on external pressure. This approach has served England well in recent years, with the team reaching significant tournament stages under his guidance.\n\nThe England manager's comments underscore the complex dynamics between club and international football, where competing priorities often create friction between managers operating at different levels of the game."

    "HWT": "Volodymyr Demchyshyn said on Wednesday that one of the reactors at the Zaporizhzhya plant in the south of Ukraine had automatically shut down. There was no problem with the reactor itself and the problem would be fixed by the weekend, he added. Zaporizhzhya produces more than one-fifth of Ukraine's electricity. The operator of the nuclear plant, Energoatom, had reported a problem with the power plant on Friday. But the details were not fully disclosed until a cabinet meeting on Wednesday when Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk asked the energy minister to report on what had happened. Mr Demchyshyn said that damage to a transformer in a power-generating unit had triggered an automatic shutdown of one of the six 1,000 MW reactors. He added that there was \"no threat\" to the safety of the reactor. The French Institute for Radiological Protection and Nuclear Safety (IRSN) told Reuters that their sensors had not detected anything unusual in Ukraine. Michel Chouha, IRSN's special representative for Central and Eastern Europe, said: \"If there was an accident, we would know.\" The drop in electricity production has left several dozen towns and villages without electricity, Russian media reported. Ukraine's energy industry is already under pressure because of a fuel shortage. Mr Demchyshyn said that Ukraine will probably have to import power from Russia this winter. He called it a \"necessary step\" despite how \"politically problematic it might be\". Last year Ukraine was self-sufficient in electricity but the conflict with pro-Russian rebels in the east of the country has severely hit coal production. Ukraine has already agreed a $4.6bn package of gas supplies from Russia, ending months of wrangling with Moscow over prices.",

Energy Minister German Galushchenko stated that while the fault has impacted power generation capacity, all safety systems remain fully operational and radiation levels are within normal parameters.\n\n\"We want to emphasize that this is a technical issue that does not compromise the safety of the plant or pose any radiological risk,\" Galushchenko said during a press briefing. \"Our technical teams are working around the clock to assess and resolve the situation.\"\n\nThe six-reactor facility, located in southeastern Ukraine, has been under Russian control since March 2022, creating ongoing concerns about its operation and maintenance. The plant has faced numerous challenges throughout the conflict, including periodic disconnections from Ukraine's power grid and reduced staffing levels.\n\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency officials have been monitoring the situation closely and confirmed that safety protocols are being followed. The organization has maintained a presence at the facility since the early stages of the conflict to ensure nuclear safety standards are upheld.\n\nThe technical fault has resulted in a temporary reduction in power output, though specific details about the nature of the malfunction have not been disclosed. Plant operators are conducting thorough diagnostics to determine the root cause and develop appropriate repair strategies.\n\nDespite the current challenges, Ukrainian officials emphasize that the plant's critical safety infrastructure remains intact. Emergency cooling systems, backup power supplies, and containment structures are all functioning normally, providing multiple layers of protection.\n\nThe incident highlights the continued vulnerabilities facing Ukraine's nuclear infrastructure during wartime conditions.

    "HWT": "The Social Liberal Union (USL) won nearly 60% of the vote, with four-fifths of ballots counted. The Right Romania Alliance (ARD) of centre-right President Traian Basescu came a distant second with about 17%. The result could open the door to a constitutional crisis, as the president has previously hinted he may refuse to reappoint his arch-rival Mr Ponta. Mr Ponta said: \"This is a clear victory with an absolute majority.\" But, if he resumes as prime minister, he will have to share power with Mr Basescu, whose term runs until 2014. The pair have been locked in a power struggle since Mr Ponta came to power in April following the collapse of the previous centre-right government. The two men have argued over control of state television and the Romanian Cultural Institute and attempts to draw up a new electoral law. But, says the BBC's correspondent in the region Nick Thorpe, the political feud often seems to have more to do with the vanity of the main players than with genuine differences in policy. Their antagonism has meant political decision-making has at times been paralysed. In July, Mr Ponta suspended Mr Basescu and tried to impeach him. But a referendum failed to meet the required turnout. Mr Basescu hinted before the election that he might refuse to re-appoint Mr Ponta as prime minister. He has described him as a \"mythomaniac\". Mr Basescu's popularity has plummeted since he introduced stringent austerity measures and a 25% cut in public sector pay. Romania is the second poorest member of the European Union, which it joined in 2007 with Bulgaria. The country, together with neighbour Bulgaria, are under special EU monitoring because of concerns about judicial independence, corruption and political influence in state institutions. Romania is trying to negotiate a new loan from the IMF to replace the existing one which expires early next year.",
    "MGT": "Romania's centre-left coalition led by Prime Minister Victor Ponta has achieved a decisive victory in the country's general election, securing a commanding mandate to continue governing the Eastern European nation.\n\nThe Social Liberal Union, comprising Ponta's Social Democratic Party and the National Liberal Party, captured approximately 60 percent of the vote, delivering a resounding endorsement of the coalition's policies and leadership. The result represents a significant triumph for Ponta, who has positioned himself as a reformist leader capable of steering Romania through economic challenges while maintaining strong ties with European partners.\n\nOpposition parties, including the centre-right Democratic Liberal Party, suffered substantial losses, with preliminary results indicating they secured less than 20 percent of the vote. The poor showing reflects voter dissatisfaction with previous governance and economic policies that many Romanians blamed for prolonged austerity measures and limited economic growth.\n\nPonta's campaign focused heavily on promises to stimulate economic recovery, create jobs, and reduce the tax burden on middle-class families. The prime minister also emphasized his commitment to maintaining Romania's pro-European stance while advocating for greater national sovereignty in certain policy areas.\n\nThe election was closely monitored by European Union officials, who have expressed concerns about democratic institutions and rule of law in several Eastern European member states. International observers reported that the voting process was conducted fairly and transparently, with no significant irregularities noted.\n\nVoter turnout reached 41 percent, slightly higher than previous elections, suggesting increased public engagement with the political process. Urban areas showed particularly strong support for the governing coalition, while rural regions demonstrated more mixed results.\n\nThe victory provides Ponta with a strong parliamentary majority, enabling his government to implement ambitious legislative agenda items including healthcare reform, infrastructure development, and anti-corruption measures. European leaders have congratulated the prime minister on his electoral success while emphasizing the importance of continued democratic reforms.\n\nFinancial markets responded positively to news of the election results, with the Romanian leu strengthening against the euro and government bond yields declining. Investors appear confident that political stability will support continued economic recovery and European integration efforts.\n\nThe new parliament is expected to convene within the coming weeks to begin addressing pressing domestic and international challenges facing the nation."

    "HWT": "Peers voted by 327 to 234, to give a majority of 93 to a Labour motion forcing the plans to be debated by a cross party select committee. Labour fears it could lose Â£6m a year under the Trade Union Bill proposals. Labour's Baroness Smith of Basildon rejected government claims the bill would not hurt her party financially. She told peers democracy would be damaged if the government pushed through the changes on funding without them being scrutinised by a select committee first. As it stands, the legislation would require Labour-affiliated union members to \"opt in\" to paying a levy to the party instead of having it automatically deducted. Lady Smith said: \"Our genuinely held concern is that this aspect of the bill will have a significant impact on the resources of one major political party - my party, the Labour Party. \"And in doing so, it will both disrupt the political balance in the UK and have a damaging effect on the electoral process and our democracy.\" Conservative and Lib Dem peers suggested the government should rethink its proposals. Tory peer Lord Forsyth said: \"It will take away funding from the Labour Party at a time when the Labour Party is perhaps not at its strongest... our Parliamentary system does depend upon having a strong and effective opposition.\" Labour is also reported to be set to lose out by about Â£1.3m a year when state funding for opposition parties - known as Short money - is cut. Junior business minister Baroness Neville-Rolfe, responding for the government, said Labour's motion would shift the focus of scrutiny on the Bill to party funding and away from its central purpose of trade union reform. She added: \"This Bill is a package of measures and it's disappointing that the party opposite has chosen to misinterpret our intentions.\"",
    "MGT": "The government faces mounting pressure to reconsider its controversial proposals to restrict trade union funding of political parties following a significant defeat in the House of Lords last night.\n\nPeers voted overwhelmingly against the measures, which would have imposed strict new limits on how unions can contribute to political campaigns and party coffers. The defeat represents a major blow to the government's broader reform agenda and signals growing opposition to what critics describe as an attack on democratic participation.\n\nThe proposed restrictions would have required unions to obtain explicit written consent from members before using their subscriptions for political purposes, effectively dismantling the current opt-out system that has operated for decades. Trade union leaders had argued the changes would severely curtail their ability to support political causes and candidates aligned with their members' interests.\n\nDuring heated debates in the upper chamber, opposition peers accused the government of attempting to silence working-class voices in politics while protecting wealthy individual donors who face no similar restrictions. Labour peers led the charge against the proposals, with several crossbench members also expressing serious reservations about the measures.\n\nThe TUC general secretary welcomed the Lords defeat, describing it as a victory for democratic principles and workers' rights. \"This government seems determined to rig the system in favor of big business while gagging ordinary working people,\" she said in a statement released shortly after the vote.\n\nGovernment ministers had defended the proposals as necessary reforms to increase transparency and ensure union members had greater control over how their money was spent. They argued the measures would strengthen democracy by giving individual workers more say in political funding decisions.\n\nThe defeat now forces the government to decide whether to use the Parliament Act to override the Lords or seek a compromise that might win broader support. Constitutional experts suggest the government may struggle to justify using the Act for measures that fundamentally alter the political funding landscape.\n\nWith several government backbenchers already expressing doubts about the proposals, ministers may face difficult choices about whether to press ahead with legislation that appears increasingly unpopular across the political spectrum."

    "prompt": "A Cumbria zoo is closing after councillors raised concerns about the potential for baboons to escape using a pile of rhino dung.",
    "HWT": "South Lakes Safari Zoo in Dalton said it would be closed from 9 January. Barrow Borough Council raised several concerns about the zoo, including the closeness of the rhino dung to a fence, and the safety of walkways. Zoo bosses said they felt \"harassed\" by the council and were unable to continue under such conditions. On Thursday Barrow Council's licensing committee issued an order to the zoo to prove within 28 days that the aerial walkways were safe. Zoo inspector Matthew Brash showed the council pictures of rotting timbers and said he and his colleagues had noted 20 slips and trips on them from the zoo's accident book. But Karen Brewer, from the zoo, said there was only one accident listed in 2015 and two in 2014. The council also said a pile of rhino dung was too close to a fence, providing a possible escape route for baboons, although the zoo said there had never been a baboon escape in 16 years of the dung being piled there. In a statement, the zoo said: \"We assure everyone that the zoo is safe and there is no evidence whatsoever to say otherwise. \"We are being subjected to an unprecedented attack and attempt to undermine our credibility and professionalism at every chance created. \"The management team cannot work under these conditions and hence the decisions made.\"",
    "MGT": "A Cumbria zoo is set to close its doors permanently following a council decision prompted by unusual safety concerns involving baboons and rhinoceros excrement.\n\nLocal councillors voted to revoke the zoo's operating license after inspectors discovered that baboons had been using accumulated rhino dung as a makeshift ladder to scale their enclosure walls. The ingenious escape method raised serious questions about the facility's security measures and public safety protocols.\n\nThe incident came to light during a routine inspection when officials observed the primates systematically stacking the large mammals' waste to create stepping stones toward the top of their habitat. Wildlife experts noted that baboons are highly intelligent creatures known for their problem-solving abilities, but this particular behavior caught authorities off guard.\n\n\"We cannot compromise on public safety,\" said Councillor Margaret Thompson, chair of the licensing committee. \"While we appreciate the animals' intelligence, the potential for escape poses unacceptable risks to both the animals and local residents.\"\n\nZoo management had reportedly been aware of the issue for several weeks but failed to implement adequate preventive measures. Attempts to remove the dung more frequently proved unsuccessful as the baboons quickly adapted their timing to coincide with cleaning schedules.\n\nThe facility, which has operated for over two decades, housed approximately 200 animals across various species. Staff are now working with wildlife organizations to relocate the animals to appropriate facilities. The closure affects twelve full-time employees and marks the end of a popular local attraction that welcomed thousands of visitors annually."

    "HWT": "Media playback is not supported on this device Sadio Mane scored twice in the space of 138 seconds as second-placed Spurs disappointed at Anfield. \"If you start a game like we start then it is very difficult,\" said Pochettino. \"It is difficult to fight for the Premier League if you show that lack of desire to play for a win.\" Chelsea can extend their lead at the top if they beat Burnley at Turf Moor on Sunday, and Pochettino added: \"If Chelsea go 12 points clear, it is a big problem.\" Spurs have won just twice on the road since 24 September, including defeats at Chelsea and Manchester United in addition to draws at fellow top-six rivals Arsenal and Manchester City. In their past 17 meetings with the other top-six sides away from home, Pochettino's team have won just once. \"In the first 45 minutes you saw a team that is not ready to fight for the Premier League,\" the Argentine told BT Sport. \"We are in a position that is up to us. But if you show like today that you cannot cope with the pressure then it is difficult to challenge and fight for the Premier League.\" Former Liverpool and Spurs midfielder Danny Murphy on Match of the Day \"I couldn't believe what I was watching, they had the best defensive record last season and the joint best this year, but they were all over the place. Against the big sides they have played with a back three but they had a back four today, but I think they should have stuck with what they have done against the big sides - play with a three. \"It was so unlike Spurs, they do so well at home, but the contrast is amazing. There's a lack of pace, and a different mindset when they go away from home. They have to improve and quickly.\"",
    "MGT": "Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino delivered a scathing assessment of his team's performance following their 2-0 defeat at Liverpool, claiming his players showed a \"lack of desire\" to win the Premier League during a disappointing first-half display at Anfield.\n\nThe Argentine coach did not hold back in his criticism after watching his side fall further behind in the title race, expressing frustration at what he perceived as a mental shortcoming rather than a tactical failure. Pochettino's comments highlight the growing pressure on Tottenham as they struggle to maintain their challenge for top honors.\n\nLiverpool dominated the opening 45 minutes, taking control of the match through goals that exposed Tottenham's defensive vulnerabilities and lack of intensity. The home side's aggressive pressing and quick passing movements consistently troubled Spurs, who appeared sluggish and unable to match their opponents' energy levels.\n\nPochettino's post-match analysis focused heavily on the psychological aspect of his team's performance, suggesting that the players' mindset was not aligned with the requirements of a title-challenging side. The manager emphasized that technical ability alone is insufficient at the highest level, particularly when facing direct competitors for major trophies.\n\nThe defeat represents a significant setback for Tottenham's Premier League ambitions, with the loss of points against a direct rival potentially proving costly in the final reckoning. The result also raises questions about the team's mental resilience when facing pressure situations away from home.\n\nLiverpool's victory demonstrated their own title credentials, with the team showing the kind of determination and clinical finishing that Pochettino felt his players lacked. The contrast between the two sides' approaches was particularly evident in the first half, where the intensity gap proved decisive.\n\nFor Tottenham, the challenge now lies in responding to their manager's criticism and proving they possess the mental fortitude required for a sustained title challenge. Pochettino's public comments suggest he believes the talent exists within his squad but questions whether the desire matches the ability.\n\nThe defeat leaves Tottenham with work to do if they are to remain genuine contenders for the Premier League crown, with Pochettino clearly demanding an immediate improvement in attitude and application from his players."

The woman, 35, had been receiving round-the-clock police protection because of the previous attacks, which were linked to a property dispute. Anger is growing at the authorities' inability to protect her. She was allegedly gang-raped and first attacked with acid by two men in 2008, over a property dispute, the details of which are not clear. The same two men are then accused of throwing acid at her twice more - in 2012 and 2013 - to try and get her to drop the criminal charges against them. In March, she was attacked again while travelling on a train with her daughter. This time she was forced to drink acid. Two men are facing trial for all of the attacks but were released on bail in April, the AFP agency reports. According to government figures, there are hundreds of such attacks involving acid each year in India, although campaigners say the real figures are much higher. The victims, who have to live with terrible disfigurements, are mainly women and are often targeted by jealous partners, campaigners say. Despite a Supreme Court ruling in 2013 to regulate the sale of acid, critics say it is still widely and easily available.",

Local authorities confirmed that an unidentified assailant threw acid at the survivor, marking the fifth such attack against her. She was immediately rushed to a nearby hospital for treatment, though the extent of her current injuries has not been disclosed.\n\nThe woman's ordeal began with an alleged gang-rape, after which she faced repeated acid attacks that left her with severe physical and psychological trauma. Despite previous incidents being reported to police, the cycle of violence has continued, raising serious questions about the effectiveness of victim protection measures in the region.\n\nAcid attacks have become a growing concern across India, with survivors often facing inadequate medical care, insufficient legal support, and social stigma. The attacks typically target women and are frequently linked to rejected marriage proposals, dowry disputes, or attempts to silence victims of sexual violence.\n\nWomen's rights activists have condemned the latest assault and called for immediate action to ensure the survivor's safety. They emphasize the urgent need for stronger law enforcement, better witness protection programs, and comprehensive support systems for survivors of gender-based violence.\n\nThe case underscores the broader challenges facing women's safety in India, where despite legal reforms, implementation and enforcement remain significant obstacles."

    "HWT": "Russia's FBI-style Investigative Committee (SK) confined him to Moscow after questioning him about an alleged plot to seize power in Russia. Mr Udaltsov denied the allegations and said a \"new repression\" was under way. Elsewhere, President Vladimir Putin sacked one of his ministers after publicly criticising him last month. No reason was given for dismissing Regional Development Minister Oleg Govorun and replacing him with Igor Slyunyayev. However, last month, in a dressing-down broadcast on TV, the Russian leader rebuked Mr Govorun for failing to deliver on his election promises to help people living in sub-standard housing in the regions. An unnamed Kremlin source quoted by Russian business newspaper Vedomosti said the main reason for Mr Putin's dissatisfaction was Mr Govorun's poor handling of the Krymsk flood disaster clean-up. Along with Mr Udaltsov, at least two other people were also placed under investigation by the SK. In Twitter messages, Mr Udaltsov, a radical leftist, said his apartment had been searched and he had been taken to SK headquarters for interrogation. \"This is lawlessness and provocation and I hope that society will not be silent,\" he was quoted as saying by Russia's Interfax news agency. A documentary last week on Russia's NTV channel, which is seen as close to the Kremlin, showed what it said was footage of the activist meeting officials from Georgia to discuss mounting a coup in Russia. In a statement released on Wednesday, the SK said it had begun an investigation into Mr Udaltsov, Leonid Razvozzhayev, Konstantin Lebedev and others on the basis of the allegations made in the documentary, Anatomy Of A Protest II. If convicted, Mr Udaltsov and the others face prison sentences of between four and 10 years. Correction, 19 October 2012:This story originally said that Mr Udaltsov had been placed under house arrest but it has now been clarified that he has been barred from leaving Moscow.",
    "MGT": "Prominent Russian opposition activist Sergei Udaltsov has been subjected to a travel ban by Moscow investigators, marking the latest restriction imposed on one of the country's most recognizable anti-government figures. The decision represents another escalation in the ongoing crackdown on dissent within Russia's political opposition movement.\n\nUdaltsov, who has emerged as one of the most vocal critics of President Vladimir Putin's administration, gained national prominence through his leadership role in organizing large-scale protests against the government. His activism has made him a central figure in Russia's opposition circles, where he has consistently advocated for democratic reforms and challenged the current political establishment.\n\nThe travel ban prevents Udaltsov from leaving Russian territory while investigators continue their examination of unspecified charges. This restriction follows a pattern of legal measures that have increasingly targeted opposition leaders and activists throughout the country. The specific nature of the investigation has not been fully disclosed by authorities, though such actions typically involve allegations related to extremist activities or violations of public assembly laws.\n\nMoscow's investigative committee has not provided detailed information about the timeline for the travel restriction or the conditions under which it might be lifted. The ban effectively confines Udaltsov to Russian soil, limiting his ability to participate in international forums or seek refuge abroad if circumstances deteriorate.\n\nThis development occurs amid a broader campaign by Russian authorities to suppress opposition activities and limit the influence of anti-government movements. Numerous activists, journalists, and political figures have faced similar restrictions, criminal charges, or forced exile in recent years. The pattern has drawn criticism from international human rights organizations and foreign governments concerned about the deteriorating state of civil liberties in Russia.\n\nUdaltsov's supporters view the travel ban as politically motivated retaliation for his continued opposition activities. They argue that such measures demonstrate the government's intolerance for legitimate political dissent and peaceful protest. The restriction also raises questions about the future of organized opposition movements within Russia, as key figures face increasing legal pressure and limitations on their activities.\n\nThe travel ban represents another chapter in the ongoing tension between Russian authorities and opposition activists who continue to challenge the current political system despite mounting legal and personal risks."

The current single carriageway experiences regular congestion, particularly during peak hours and tourist seasons.\n\nThe project's approval marks a significant milestone, following extensive planning and consultation processes.

They emphasize that improved transport links are essential for regional development and competitiveness.\n\nThe dual carriageway would feature modern safety standards, including improved junctions and enhanced facilities for pedestrians and cyclists. Environmental considerations have been incorporated into the design process, with measures planned to minimize ecological impact.\n\nWhile the funding challenge remains, supporters express optimism that the project's approval demonstrates government commitment to infrastructure development.

He was fined £200. He was also ordered to pay £250 in compensation to the legal owner of the garage who had registered it with the Land Registry, unlike Phillips.

The CPJ said Syrian journalists should be protected rather than detained. Turkey has come under criticism for its treatment of journalists. Mr Jarrah founded the independent citizen journalist group ANA Press, providing reports to international media, after leaving Syria. Rami Jarrah: 'Total chaos and crisis in Aleppo' He was initially held in a detention facility for foreign citizens, but was moved to a different facility on Thursday and it was not clear where he was currently being held, the CPJ said. He was questioned about his work, but was given access to a lawyer and had not been charged with any crime, the group added. \"Syrian journalists like Jarrah, who have turned to Turkey for safe refuge, should be protected rather than subjected to detention and harassment,\" said CPJ co-ordinator Nina Ognianova. Mr Jarrah's father, Nouri al-Jarrah, said he was \"surprised and concerned\" by his son's arrest and called for his immediate release. He said his son and other Syrian journalists had earlier met Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who promised that the Turkish authorities would support them in their work. Ms Ognianova said Mr Jarrah was known for his independent reporting, which she said was carried out at great personal risk. Mr Jarrah, who was brought up in the UK, fled Syria with his wife and child in 2011 fearing that he was in danger but continued to go back to report. The CPJ says independent reporting such as that conducted by ANA Press is increasingly rare in Syria, with more and more journalists working under the protection of armed groups or being members of those groups. Press freedom 'a major concern'",
    "MGT": "A prominent media advocacy organization has issued an urgent appeal for the immediate release of an independent Syrian journalist currently being held in Turkish detention, raising fresh concerns about press freedom in the region.\n\nThe journalist, whose identity has not been publicly disclosed for security reasons, was reportedly detained by Turkish authorities under circumstances that remain unclear. The media rights group emphasized that the detention appears to be connected to the journalist's professional work covering developments related to the ongoing Syrian conflict.\n\nTurkey has served as a crucial base for many Syrian journalists and media workers who fled their homeland during the civil war that began in 2011. The country hosts millions of Syrian refugees and has been a key staging ground for international media coverage of the conflict. However, press freedom advocates have increasingly raised concerns about the treatment of journalists operating within Turkish borders.\n\nThe advocacy group's statement highlighted the journalist's contributions to independent reporting on Syrian affairs, describing their work as essential for maintaining international awareness of the humanitarian crisis. The organization stressed that detaining journalists for their professional activities violates fundamental principles of press freedom and undermines efforts to document ongoing developments in the region.\n\nTurkish authorities have not yet responded to requests for comment regarding the specific circumstances of the detention or the charges, if any, that may have been filed against the journalist. The lack of transparency surrounding the case has intensified calls from international press freedom organizations for immediate clarification.\n\nThe incident occurs amid broader concerns about media freedom in Turkey, where numerous journalists have faced legal challenges in recent years. International watchdog organizations have consistently ranked Turkey among countries with significant restrictions on press freedom, citing various cases of journalist detentions and prosecutions.\n\nSyrian journalists working in exile face particular vulnerabilities, often lacking the legal protections afforded to citizens while continuing to report on sensitive political developments. Many have continued their work despite threats and legal uncertainties, viewing their role as crucial for maintaining international attention on the Syrian crisis.\n\nThe media advocacy group has called on Turkish authorities to ensure due process and transparency while urging the international community to monitor the situation closely."

    "HWT": "Rail, Maritime and Transport union members will vote in the coming weeks amid claims that industrial relations have \"comprehensively broken down\". The union is also seeking a four-hour cut in the working week to 35 hours. A Southern spokesman said the rail operator was aware of the issues and \"dialogue with the union is ongoing\". He added that it had received no formal notification from the RMT union that it intended to ballot its members.

The Rail, Maritime and Transport union announced the ballot following growing concerns about new roster arrangements and what workers describe as \"impossible work targets.\"\n\nThe dispute centers on recent changes to shift patterns that engineers claim are causing significant disruption to work-life balance. Union representatives argue that management has implemented unrealistic productivity expectations that are putting undue pressure on staff and potentially compromising safety standards.\n\nSouthern rail engineers have expressed frustration over increased workloads without corresponding support or resources. The proposed rosters are said to extend working hours while reducing flexibility, making it difficult for employees to maintain adequate rest periods between shifts.\n\nThis latest development adds to Southern rail's ongoing operational challenges, which have already resulted in significant service disruptions across the network. Passengers have experienced frequent cancellations and delays in recent months, contributing to mounting pressure on the franchise.\n\nThe ballot is expected to take place over the coming weeks, with results determining whether strike action will proceed.

    "HWT": "Previous displays in Boston, Lincolnshire, have featured clusters of lights and miniature trees along its cobbled shopping streets. But this year's simpler offering has been compared unfavourably to a living room Christmas tree by some. Councillor Paul Skinner said the authority could no longer justify the Â£40,000 annual cost. More on this and other local stories from across Lincolnshire He said Boston Borough Council's Christmas lights contract came to an end this year, and it voted not to renew it. In previous years, as pictured below, trees were lit up along the length of Church Street, with clusters of lights used to illuminate the sections across the street. Posting on Facebook, one resident described the authority as \"a bunch of miserable scrooges\". While one caller to BBC Radio Lincolnshire said her four-year-old daughter \"absolutely cried her eyes out because there was nothing to look at\". She said her own personal Christmas tree had as many lights as the town centre display. On social media, Frank Slater described the council as \"a bunch of miserable scrooges\" while Gina Tilling described the lights as \"dismal\". Others said it looked as though Christmas had been cancelled, and Boston was \"dark and joyless\". Barry Brackenbury joked that the council was doing its bit to \"slow global warming\". Responding to the comments, Mr Skinner said: \"It could have been better, but people shouldn't be surprised.\" He said: \"We've taken Â£2m out of the budget, and for the next four years we've got to take another Â£2m out.\" The authority said it will look again at what can be done in future years.",

Social media platforms have been flooded with complaints from disappointed families who had looked forward to admiring festive illuminations throughout the town center.\n\n\"It's absolutely shameful,\" said Margaret Thompson, a longtime resident. \"My grandchildren were so excited to see the Christmas lights, but when we walked through town, there was barely anything to see. It looks like they've given up trying.\"\n\nThe sparse lighting display has become a talking point throughout the community, with residents comparing their town unfavorably to neighboring areas that have invested in more elaborate decorations. Many have taken to calling council members \"Scrooges\" on social media, referencing Charles Dickens' famous miserly character who despised Christmas celebrations.\n\nLocal business owners have also voiced concerns that the lackluster display could impact footfall during the crucial Christmas shopping period. Shop owner David Martinez explained, \"People come from surrounding villages to see our Christmas lights and do their shopping. This year, I'm worried they'll go elsewhere instead.\"\n\nThe council has defended its decision, citing budget constraints and increased costs for electricity and equipment maintenance. A spokesperson stated that they had to make \"difficult choices\" while managing taxpayer money responsibly during challenging economic times.\n\nHowever, residents argue that Christmas lights are essential for community morale and local economy, particularly after difficult recent years. Some have even suggested organizing fundraising efforts to supplement the council's budget for next year's display.\n\nThe debate highlights the ongoing tension between fiscal responsibility and community expectations, as local authorities nationwide grapple with reduced budgets while trying to maintain public services and amenities that residents value during the festive season."

    "HWT": "The actor suffered a heart attack and was found at his home in California on Sunday. Pugsley was the oldest child of Gomez and Morticia Addams in the 1960s TV series. The show featured a family of macabre oddballs who believed they were normal, and was famed for its catchy finger-snapping theme song. The dysfunctional family were first created by cartoonist Charles Addams in the New Yorker magazine. The characters were made into a TV show, which aired on ABC from 1964 to 1966, had a total of 64 episodes. Weatherwax, who also voiced the role of Pugsley in an animated version of the series in the 1970s, played Pugsley senior in a TV special Halloween With the New Addams Family in 1977.. Three films based on the show were made during the 1990s. The first two starred Anjelica Huston, the late Raul Julia and Christopher Lloyd, while the third, released for TV in 1998, featured Darryl Hannah and Tim Curry. Following his role in The Addams Family, Weatherwax featured in several TV commercials and served in the army. He also worked for Universal Studios as a grip - providing support to camera operatives - according to his niece Shanyn Viera. In a 2007 interview on Fox News, Weatherwax said he enjoyed taking on the role of Pugsley but found it hard to find work because of typecasting. Weatherwax also said he had been teased at school about his character's name. He retired a few years ago for medical reasons, Ms Vieira added.",
    "MGT": "Ken Weatherwax, the actor who charmed television audiences as the mischievous Pugsley Addams in the beloved 1960s sitcom \"The Addams Family,\" has died at his home in California. He was 59.\n\nWeatherwax suffered a heart attack, according to his family who confirmed his passing. The former child actor had become an integral part of television history through his portrayal of the round-faced, often-explosive-experimenting son of Gomez and Morticia Addams.\n\nThe actor began his role as Pugsley at the age of nine when \"The Addams Family\" first aired in 1964. The show, based on Charles Addams' macabre cartoon characters, ran for two seasons and has since achieved cult status, spawning multiple remakes and adaptations.\n\nAfter the series ended in 1966, Weatherwax found it difficult to shake off his association with the role of Pugsley. Like many child actors of his era, he struggled to transition into adult acting roles. He eventually left acting and worked behind the scenes in Hollywood as a grip and set builder.\n\nIn later years, Weatherwax embraced his connection to the show, occasionally appearing at fan conventions and sharing memories of his time as part of television's most famously peculiar family. He often spoke fondly of his co-stars, particularly John Astin and Carolyn Jones, who played his on-screen parents.\n\nThe actor's death marks another farewell to a member of the original Addams Family cast. He is survived by his brother Joey Vieira, also a former child actor, and other family members. Fans worldwide remember him as the cheerfully strange boy who helped make the unconventional Addams Family a television phenomenon that continues to entertain audiences decades later."

    "HWT": "Halfpenny has been at Toulon since 2014 but is out of contract in the summer. And while the 27-year-old may opt to return home to Wales, Dominguez is adamant he should stay in France if he is to keep developing his game. \"We speak very often with him about [his future], and I am confident he will stay,\" Dominguez said. \"I think for him it will be the best decision to be outside [Wales], to challenge the best every week. \"I respect him as a person so I have told him this, not as a coach, but as personal advice.\" Halfpenny joined Toulon from Cardiff Blues from the 2014-15 campaign and was a Heineken Cup winner at the end of his first season with the club. Under the terms of the Welsh Rugby Union's senior player selection policy, Halfpenny will have to rely on a wildcard pick if he is to play for the national side. Interim head coach Rob Howley hopes the ruling will encourage those based overseas to return to a region. It is understood Halfpenny remains open-minded about his future, and is concentrating on reaching peak form and fitness after missing the bulk of last season with a serious knee injury. However Dominguez, the former Italy fly-half, believes the player will soon be back to his best. \"It is never simple to come back but Leigh is coming back very well. He is very professional. I have no doubt he will come back 100% as he was before the injury,\" Dominguez told BBC Radio 5 live. \"He is happy at the club, he is having a good time. This year he is much more open, he is making new friends in France, speaking French. \"He hasn't made the decision yet, but I will be very happy if he stays and the club will be very happy if he stays.\" Halfpenny confirmed in September he will be available for the British and Irish Lions tour of New Zealand next summer. He said Toulon will allow him to miss the Top 14 finals to join up with the Lions should he be selected.",
    "MGT": "French rugby powerhouse Toulon appears set to retain the services of Welsh star Leigh Halfpenny, with head coach Diego Dominguez expressing confidence that the full-back will extend his stay with the Top 14 club.\n\nThe former British and Irish Lions player, who joined Toulon in 2014, has been the subject of intense speculation regarding his future, with several clubs reportedly interested in securing his signature. However, Dominguez's recent comments suggest that Halfpenny's immediate future lies in the south of France.\n\n\"We are very optimistic about keeping Leigh with us,\" Dominguez said at a press conference following the team's training session. \"He has been an integral part of our squad, and we believe he will continue to be a key player for Toulon next season.\"\n\nHalfpenny, known for his exceptional goal-kicking ability and solid defensive skills, has become a fan favorite at the Stade Mayol despite dealing with several injury setbacks during his tenure. His accuracy with the boot and tactical awareness have proved invaluable for the three-time European champions.\n\nThe Welsh international's current contract is set to expire at the end of this season, and there had been suggestions that he might return to Wales to play for one of the regional sides. The Welsh Rugby Union has been keen to bring their top players back home, implementing a selection policy that favors players based in Wales.\n\nHowever, Dominguez's optimistic stance indicates that negotiations between the club and Halfpenny's representatives are progressing well. \"We have had positive discussions, and I believe we can reach an agreement that benefits both parties,\" the head coach added.\n\nToulon's determination to retain Halfpenny reflects their ambition to maintain their status as one of Europe's premier rugby clubs. The full-back's experience and reliability have been crucial in high-pressure matches, and his presence would be vital for the club's future campaigns.\n\nWhile the exact terms of any potential new contract remain undisclosed, sources close to the club suggest that Toulon is prepared to offer a competitive package to ensure Halfpenny's continued service.\n\nThe news will likely disappoint Welsh rugby fans who had hoped to see their national team star return home, but it represents a significant boost for Toulon as they look to build their squad for the upcoming season. With Halfpenny seemingly set to stay, the French club can focus on strengthening other areas of their team in their quest for domestic and European success."

The debris is thought to have broken away shortly before hitting Miss Martin, from Stafford. Environmental health officers are investigating, the hearing was told. Read more news for Birmingham and the Black Country Solihull-born Miss Martin, who worked at the University of Wolverhampton, was struck by the cover while walking near a Starbucks cafe in Dudley Street last Thursday. It is believed the cover was attached to a structure on the roof of the nearby Mander Centre shopping mall. Det Sgt John Garbett, of West Midlands Police, told the Black Country Coroner's Court officers had recovered CCTV footage showing the moment the object fell from a roof and hit Miss Martin. A joint inquiry with the Health and Safety Executive and Wolverhampton City Council established the cover was thought to have been attached to one of two brick structures on the uppermost roof of the shopping mall, Mr Garbett said. Environmental health officers are investigating the cover's maintenance schedule, which caused Miss Martin's fatal head injuries, the inquest heard.

The inquest heard that regular maintenance checks might have identified the dangerous condition of the water tank cover before it caused the fatal incident.\n\nWitnesses described how the powerful winds of Storm Doris, which battered the region with exceptional force, dislodged the wooden cover from its mounting. The victim, a dedicated member of the university staff, was walking across campus when the debris struck her with devastating impact.\n\nSafety experts testified that the wooden structure had deteriorated significantly over time, with evidence of rot and structural weakness that had gone unaddressed.

Emergency services responded quickly to the scene, but despite their best efforts, they were unable to save the victim's life.\n\nThe incident has raised serious questions about the maintenance procedures and safety protocols in place at the university, particularly regarding elevated structures exposed to severe weather conditions.

    "HWT": "Paul Cummins received threats by email, phone and letter over plans for services charities to benefit from the Â£10m raised, he told the Sunday Times. The Derbyshire artist said he believed it was because some people felt the charities were \"involved in war\". Blood Swept Lands And Seas Of Red saw 888,246 ceramic poppies \"planted\" in the moat. Each poppy represented one British or colonial military death during World War One. The installation culminated on Armistice Day when the final poppy was planted by 13-year old cadet Harry Hayes from Berkshire, before the guns were fired 21 times and a two-minute silence was observed. Mr Cummins said: \"The threats came, I suppose, because they felt that the money was going to charities which in some way were involved in war.\" He added that police had been called in over the matter. It is thought about five million people visited Blood-Swept Lands and Seas of Red, the title of which was inspired by a line from the will of a Derbyshire serviceman who died in Flanders. He had described \"the blood-swept lands and seas of red, where angels fear to tread\". The following day a team of 8,000 volunteers started removing the 888,246 poppies and sending them to the people who bought them for Â£25 each. The net proceeds plus 10% of every sale generated the Â£10m being shared between Help for Heroes, the Royal British Legion, Combat Stress, Cobseo, Coming Home and SSAFA.

During the creation of the poppies, Cummins lost part of a finger in an accident with industrial equipment, adding a personal sacrifice to the memorial's creation.\n\nThe installation drew an estimated five million visitors and raised millions of pounds for military charities. Following its display, the poppies were sold to members of the public, with proceeds benefiting various veterans' organizations.\n\nWhile the threats cast a shadow over the project's creation, they did not diminish its impact or significance.

    "HWT": "The men were watching a World Cup game in June 1994 when gunmen burst into the Heights Bar in Loughinisland, County Down, and opened fire. Five others were wounded in the attack carried out by the loyalist paramilitary Ulster Volunteer Force. No-one has ever been convicted of the attack. Families of the victims have persistently accused the police of failing to properly investigate the killings, claiming they wanted to protect informers. They have alleged there was collusion between some police officers and those who carried out the attack. The men who died were Adrian Rogan 34, Malcolm Jenkinson, 53, Barney Greene, 87, Daniel McCreanor 59, Patrick O'Hare, 35, and Eamon Byrne, 39. Mr Greene was one of the oldest people to be killed in the Northern Ireland Troubles. Five years ago the previous police ombudsman, Al Hutchinson, published a report which said the police had not properly investigated the killings. But his report said there was insufficient evidence of collusion between the police and the Ulster Volunteer Force. The families took legal action and in December 2012 the report's findings were quashed. Mr Hutchinson resigned shortly afterwards and his successor, Dr Michael Maguire, re-opened the investigation. The families and their lawyers were briefed about the findings in Loughinisland on Wednesday. Dr Maguire's report will contain thousands of words, but for the families of those killed and seriously injured in the Heights Bar, the focus will be on whether he uses just one word - collusion. South Down MP, the SDLP's Margaret Ritchie, told BBC Radio Ulster's Good Morning Ulster programme: \"We want to see Dr Maguire call it for what it is. It is collusion. \"\"But we also want him to say quite clearly, who did it, how many were involved in it, was there local involvement in this heinous crime?\"",

The victims' families have long maintained that members of the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) provided intelligence and protection to the killers, enabling them to carry out the murders with impunity.\n\nFamily members of the deceased have spent years campaigning for justice and transparency, claiming that evidence of police cooperation with the loyalist gang was deliberately suppressed or destroyed. They argue that several police officers had prior knowledge of planned attacks but failed to intervene or warn potential victims.\n\nThe Ombudsman's investigation has examined thousands of documents, interviewed dozens of former police officers, and reviewed forensic evidence from the original murder investigations. Sources close to the inquiry suggest that investigators have uncovered disturbing patterns of information sharing between certain police officers and members of the loyalist gang.\n\nThe upcoming ruling is expected to address specific allegations of police officers providing sensitive intelligence about potential targets, deliberately misleading murder investigations, and destroying evidence that could have implicated gang members in the killings.\n\nCivil rights groups and victims' advocates have described the investigation as a crucial test of accountability for legacy cases from Northern Ireland's troubled past. They argue that establishing the truth about alleged state collusion with paramilitary groups is essential for building trust in modern policing institutions.\n\nThe Police Service of Northern Ireland, which replaced the RUC in 2001, has pledged to cooperate fully with the Ombudsman's findings and implement any recommended reforms. However, retired police officers' associations have consistently denied allegations of systematic collusion, arguing that any wrongdoing was limited to isolated individuals rather than reflecting institutional policy.\n\nThe Ombudsman's ruling, expected to be released in the coming weeks, could have significant implications for other historical cases involving allegations of state collusion during The Troubles."

    "prompt": "There are 94,000 fewer smokers in Wales since a ban on lighting up in enclosed public places came into force 10 years ago, Welsh Government data shows.",
    "HWT": "Sunday marks a decade since the law came in and 19% of adults in Wales now smoke compared to 24% before the ban. There are also 6% fewer teenage boys and 14% fewer teenage girls smoking. Campaign charity Ash Wales said there had been a \"major cultural shift\" but smokers' group Forest said the ban had hit pubs and clubs. The only group that saw an increase in smokers was the unemployed, where the level has risen from 41% to 43% in the last 10 years. Ash Cymru said other measures had contributed to the fall in smoking, such as the ban on sales from vending machines, uniform packaging, and the rise in the age limit to buy tobacco from 16 to 18. Chief executive Suzanne Cass said: \"The smoking ban has resulted in the most positive improvement in the nation's health in decades. \"The significance of this legislation should not be underestimated. \"Thousands more children now live in a smoke-free home, and hundreds of thousands of people are no longer subjected to the deadly effects of passive smoking.\" Ms Cass also said she supported the increased use of e-cigarettes, with 141,000 users in Wales, saying they are \"95% less harmful than traditional cigarettes\". The charity's research showed 81% of people in Wales supported the ban - including three quarters of smokers themselves. However, in its own survey of 1,000 people, pro-smoking group Forest found 58% of people think pubs and private members' clubs should be allowed to provide well-ventilated smoking rooms, with 37% opposed. Forest director Simon Clark said: \"The suggestion that the smoking ban is hugely popular has been exposed as a myth. \"The smoking ban hit pubs and working men's clubs really badly.\" He called on the Welsh Government to commission an independent review on the full impact of the ban including public health, the hospitality industry and local communities. It will comment on the figures on Monday.",
    "MGT": "A decade after Wales implemented its landmark ban on smoking in enclosed public spaces, government data reveals a significant decline in the number of smokers across the nation, with 94,000 fewer people lighting up compared to pre-ban figures.\n\nThe smoking ban, which came into effect in 2007, prohibited smoking in pubs, restaurants, offices, and other enclosed public spaces, marking a crucial turning point in Wales's public health policy. The legislation aimed to protect non-smokers from the harmful effects of secondhand smoke and encourage smokers to quit.\n\nHealth experts and government officials are hailing the ban as a major success in improving public health. Dr. Sarah Evans, a public health consultant in Cardiff, noted, \"The smoking ban has been transformative for Welsh communities. Not only has it created healthier environments in public spaces, but it has also contributed to changing social attitudes towards smoking.\"\n\nLocal businesses, particularly in the hospitality sector, initially expressed concerns about potential negative impacts on their revenue. However, many establishments have reported that the transition has been smoother than anticipated, with some even noting an increase in patronage from families and non-smokers.\n\n\"At first, we were worried about losing customers,\" said David Hughes, owner of a popular Cardiff pub. \"But we've actually seen more people coming in, especially families who previously avoided pubs due to the smoke. The air is cleaner, and our maintenance costs have gone down significantly.\"\n\nThe Welsh Government's data also indicates a broader shift in public attitudes towards smoking. Young people, in particular, are less likely to start smoking compared to previous generations. Support for the ban has grown steadily over the years, with recent surveys showing that over 80% of Welsh residents now favor the smoke-free legislation.\n\nDespite these positive trends, health officials emphasize that there is still work to be done. Smoking remains one of the leading causes of preventable death in Wales, with particularly high rates in some economically disadvantaged areas.\n\nThe government has announced plans to build on this success with additional measures to reduce smoking rates further, including increased support for smoking cessation programs and expanded smoke-free areas in outdoor public spaces.\n\nThe Welsh example has become a model for other regions considering similar public health measures, demonstrating how legislative intervention can effectively contribute to improved public health outcomes and social change."

German artist Michael Sailstorfer buried £10,000 worth of bullion as part of Folkestone Triennial arts festival. The trio travelled from their home in Canterbury to join the gold rush on Friday. Describing the moment he struck the precious metal, Mr Wood, 28, said: \"My legs went from under me and I started shaking. \"I put it quietly in my pocket. We left the beach and half-way home, we pulled over for a drink.\" The Folkestone Digs project is part of the town's arts festival which has included work by artists including Tracey Emin, Jeremy Deller and Martin Creed in previous years. Artists including Yoko Ono are taking part in this year's festival which runs until November 2. Mr Wood said the couple first thought they might sell the gold straight away and go on holiday to Paris. \"Now we're thinking we might keep hold of it because of all the interest,\" he said. \"We are not going to rush into anything.\" Curator Lewis Biggs said the beach had been full since it was announced on Thursday the gold had been buried. \"There are always people digging on the beach but there's a lot more digging on the beach now,\" he said. \"When it's at high tide there are maybe 50 people, when it's low tide maybe 1,000. \"There are a lot of people coming and going of all ages - families, dedicated people with metal detectors, people with lights on their heads all night. \"It's been fun down there.\" It is not known how many other people may have found the gold bars. \"What you find is yours and you can tell other people or not,\" said Mr Biggs. \"You can stick it in your sock and take it home so we will never know if they have all been found or not.\"",

The gold was part of a larger treasure trove deliberately buried along the Kent coast, though the exact value of their finds has not been disclosed.\n\nLocal resident Sarah Thompson, who witnessed one of the discoveries, described the moment: \"There was such excitement in the air. When they realized what they'd found, you could hear the cheers from halfway down the beach. It was like watching a real-life treasure hunt unfold.\"\n\nThe gold deposits were reportedly placed by a private organization seeking to promote tourism and adventure in the region. The initiative has drawn thousands of amateur treasure hunters to Kent's shores since its announcement, armed with metal detectors and spades, all hoping to strike it lucky.\n\n\"This is exactly the kind of boost our coastal communities need,\" said James Morton, head of Folkestone's Tourism Board. \"We've seen a significant increase in visitors, and local businesses are thriving as treasure hunters spend time in our cafes and shops between their searches.\"\n\nMaritime historians note that while Kent's coastline has a rich history of shipwrecks and smuggling, this modern-day treasure hunt has created its own unique chapter in the region's story. The confirmed discoveries have only intensified the treasure-hunting fever, with more people now flocking to the area.\n\nLocal authorities have issued guidelines to ensure the treasure hunting activities remain safe and environmentally responsible. \"We're delighted people are enjoying this exciting initiative, but we ask everyone to respect the beach environment and follow the proper protocols for digging,\" said Coastal Officer Michelle Davies.\n\nThe success of the first three finders has sparked speculation about how much more gold remains to be discovered. While organizers remain tight-lipped about the total amount buried, they confirm that significant treasures are still waiting to be found along the Kent coast.\n\nAs news of the discoveries spreads, the beaches of Kent continue to draw hopeful treasure hunters from across the country, all dreaming of becoming the next lucky finder of buried gold in this modern-day treasure hunt."

The attacking pair were also regular scorers for the Dark Blues last season, Hemmings notching 25 goals, Stewart 11. \"They are fantastic players. Hopefully we can keep hold of them for a bit longer,\" O'Dea, 29, told BBC Scotland. \"They are obviously two good pals of mine and it is about getting the right move, it's not moving for the sake of it. \"If you go to England you will probably earn more money but the two of them can really progress and go on to a very high level in the game. It's important if they did move, it's the right move. \"To replace them, it's virtually impossible, because you don't have the money to go and replace them.\" Former Rangers youth player Hemmings and Stewart played together at Cowdenbeath and have scored almost 60 goals between them for Paul Hartley's side in the last two seasons. \"You need to have recruitment, which Dundee do have, and you need to have an eye for a player, which our manager does have,\" added Republic of Ireland cap O'Dea, who headed Dundee's other goal against Dumbarton. \"These two lads came from lower league clubs. Credit to the manager, he's found talent in lower leagues, which there is an abundance of. \"But to actually go and replace them straightaway is virtually impossible.\" Rangers, Aberdeen and Leeds United are among the clubs rumoured to be keen on prising Stewart away from Dens Park. \"There's going to be interest in Greg the way he's performed over the last two years,\" said manager Hartley after what he called a \"sublime\" performance from the attacking midfielder on Saturday. \"But we don't want to sell him.

Hemmings and Stewart have formed a formidable partnership up front, contributing significantly to Dundee's goal-scoring efforts throughout the campaign.\n\n\"When you look at what Kane and Greg bring to the team, it's not just about the goals,\" O'Dea explained. \"Their understanding of each other's game and their ability to create chances has been vital for us. Finding players who can replicate that chemistry would be extremely difficult, especially in the short term.\"\n\nHemmings, who arrived from Barnsley, has proven to be a clinical finisher, while Stewart's creative flair and technical ability have made him a fan favorite at Dens Park. Their performances haven't gone unnoticed, with several clubs reportedly showing interest in securing their services.\n\nO'Dea acknowledged the reality of modern football, where smaller clubs often struggle to retain their top talents when bigger teams come calling. \"That's the nature of the game,\" he said. \"When players perform well, they attract attention. But from our perspective, losing either of them would leave a massive void in our attacking options.\"\n\nThe defender's comments come amid speculation about potential transfer activity during the window, with both strikers being linked to moves away from the club. Dundee's management has remained tight-lipped about any concrete offers, but O'Dea's remarks suggest there is genuine concern about the possibility of losing their key attackers.\n\n\"The club is obviously doing everything they can to keep both players,\" O'Dea added. \"They're not just important on the pitch; they're great characters in the dressing room as well. Replacing that combination of talent and personality isn't something that happens overnight.\"\n\nAs Dundee continues their campaign, the future of Hemmings and Stewart remains a talking point among supporters and media alike. O'Dea's candid assessment serves as a reminder of their value to the team and the challenge that would face the club should either player depart."

    "HWT": "Li-fi can deliver internet access 100 times faster than traditional wi-fi, offering speeds of up to 1Gbps (gigabit per second). It requires a light source, such as a standard LED bulb, an internet connection and a photo detector. It was tested this week by Estonian start-up Velmenni, in Tallinn. Velmenni used a li-fi-enabled light bulb to transmit data at speeds of 1Gbps. Laboratory tests have shown theoretical speeds of up to 224Gbps. It was tested in an office, to allow workers to access the internet and in an industrial space, where it provided a smart lighting solution. Speaking to the International Business Times, chief executive Deepak Solanki said that the technology could reach consumers \"within three to four years\". The term li-fi was first coined by Prof Harald Haas from Edinburgh University, who demonstrated the technology at a Ted (Technology, Entertainment and Design) conference in 2011. His talk, which has now been watched nearly two million times, showed an LED lamp streaming video. Prof Haas described a future when billions of light bulbs could become wireless hotspots. One of the big advantages of li-fi is the fact that, unlike wi-fi,  it does not interfere with other radio signals, so could be utilised on aircraft and in other places where interference is an issue. While the spectrum for radio waves is in short supply, the visible light spectrum is 10,000 times larger, meaning it is unlikely to run out any time soon. But the technology also has its drawbacks - most notably the fact that it cannot be deployed outdoors in direct sunlight, because that would interfere with its signal. Neither can the technology travel through walls so initial use is likely to be limited to places where it can be used to supplement wi-fi networks, such as in congested urban areas or places where wi-fi is not safe, such as hospitals.",
    "MGT": "Scientists have successfully demonstrated a groundbreaking data transmission technology that utilizes visible light instead of traditional radio waves, marking a significant advancement in wireless communication. The breakthrough system was recently tested in a fully operational office environment, showcasing its potential for real-world applications.\n\nThe technology, known as Visible Light Communication (VLC), transmits data through rapid modulation of LED lights at speeds imperceptible to the human eye. While the lights appear to be continuously illuminated to observers, they are actually flickering at millions of times per second to encode and transmit information.\n\nDuring the office trial, researchers installed specially modified LED ceiling lights that could both illuminate the workspace and transmit data to computers and mobile devices equipped with appropriate receivers. The system achieved impressive data transfer speeds while maintaining normal lighting conditions for office workers.\n\n\"This technology represents a paradigm shift in how we think about wireless communication,\" said Dr. Sarah Chen, lead researcher on the project. \"By utilizing the visible light spectrum, we're tapping into a virtually untapped resource that's already present in every illuminated indoor space.\"\n\nThe advantages of VLC over traditional radio-frequency transmission are numerous. The technology offers enhanced security since light cannot penetrate walls, reducing the risk of data interception. It also eliminates interference with existing radio-frequency devices and potentially provides more reliable connections in areas where radio wave transmission is problematic.\n\nThe successful office trial has generated significant interest from telecommunications companies and businesses looking to enhance their data infrastructure. Industry experts predict that VLC could help address the growing demand for wireless bandwidth, particularly in crowded urban environments where radio frequency spectrum is increasingly congested.\n\nWhile the technology is still in development, researchers anticipate that VLC could be commercially available within the next few years. Initial applications are likely to focus on indoor environments such as offices, hospitals, and data centers, where controlled lighting conditions can be maintained.\n\nThe research team is now working on improving the system's performance under varying lighting conditions and developing more cost-effective components for mass production."

They pulled him to the surface and stabilised him until the ambulance arrived to take him to Southmead Hospital in Bristol. \"After a number of MRI scans and X-Rays the Drs decided to operate at 2am to stabilise my neck as pressure was being put on my spinal cord,\" Jackson added in a Facebook post. \"In surgery they removed my shattered disc, relocated my vertebrae and fixed it in place with a metal plate. \"I woke up in ICU, luckily completely coherent, however no feeling below my neck other than limited movement in my right arm.\" Bath-born Jackson has made 36 appearances for the Dragons since joining from Wasps in 2015 and signed a contract extension with the region in December.",

    "prompt": "The latest weather data suggest that the Earth's average temperature is close to breaking the record set in 2010.",
    "HWT": "Even more striking is the fact that if this occurs, then fourteen out of fifteen of the warmest years on record will have occurred since the turn of the century. However, while record-breaking warmth is consistent with the general trend of global warming, it's not always the case that each year is warmer than the previous one. There are temporary ups and downs that ride on top of the overall warming trend. It's quite possible for a few years to elapse before the next record year, and the warming can speed up or slow down for runs of years, as happened for example in the slowdown of warming since the end of the last century. So what makes one year warmer or colder than its predecessor? The answer to this depends on a number of factors. Large volcanic eruptions can cause a temporary dip in temperatures for a few years due to reflection of sunlight by the resulting atmospheric particles. This happened following the eruption of Mt Pinatubo in 1991, for example. Fluctuations in the ocean can also cause temporary ups and downs, and the massive heat release during an El Nino event in the tropics can temporarily raise global temperatures, such as occurred in 1998. This year, the tropical ocean has indeed warmed up in both the Pacific and the Atlantic but both of these ocean basins have also been very warm in northern latitudes, compounding the effect on global temperature. While the oceans exhibit record warmth, it is the average temperature over land regions and in the Arctic that has risen most. It is worth noting that this is consistent with predictions from computer models of climate change, which have suggested for many years that warming over land, and over the Arctic, will outstrip the increase in global average temperature as climate change progresses. The WMO report highlights a number of record-breaking weather events around the world:",
    "MGT": "Global temperatures are on track to shatter previous records, according to the latest climate data released by leading meteorological organizations. Scientists report that the Earth's average temperature is approaching the historic high recorded in 2010, raising concerns among climate experts about the accelerating pace of global warming.\n\nRecent measurements from weather stations worldwide indicate that temperatures across both hemispheres have been consistently higher than normal, with particularly notable increases observed in the Northern Hemisphere. Urban areas have experienced more frequent heat waves, while Arctic regions continue to warm at an alarming rate.\n\nDr. Sarah Chen, a climatologist at the Global Climate Research Institute, explains that this trend is not unexpected but is occurring faster than many models predicted. \"What we're seeing is consistent with climate change projections, but the speed at which we're approaching previous records is concerning,\" she said.\n\nThe 2010 record, which saw global temperatures reach unprecedented levels, was influenced by a strong El Niño event. However, current temperatures are approaching similar levels without such significant natural weather phenomena, suggesting a more fundamental shift in global climate patterns.\n\nThe implications of these rising temperatures extend beyond mere statistics. Agricultural regions worldwide report challenging growing conditions, while coastal areas face increased risks from rising sea levels and more intense storm systems. Urban planners and government officials are scrambling to develop heat management strategies for cities, where the urban heat island effect amplifies already high temperatures.\n\nEnvironmental groups have seized upon this data to renew calls for more aggressive climate action. \"These numbers should serve as a wake-up call,\" said James Morton, director of Climate Action Now. \"We're running out of time to implement meaningful changes to our energy and industrial systems.\"\n\nScientists emphasize that breaking the 2010 record would be more than just a symbolic milestone. It would represent another clear indicator of the Earth's warming trajectory and the urgent need for global cooperation to address climate change. As temperatures continue to climb, experts warn that without immediate action, such records may become increasingly common in the years ahead."

    "HWT": "Top seed Williams won the first set 6-4 and was a tie-break away from defeating the 26th seed when they came off. After a two-and-a-half hour delay, Williams converted a fifth match point to win 6-4 7-6 (12-10) in Paris. The American, 34, aiming for her 22nd Grand Slam title, was joined in the next round by older sister Venus. Venus's match against France's Alize Cornet was stopped at 2-1 because of the rain but the 35-year-old came back to seal a hard-fought 7-6 1-6 6-0 win. Serena had dropped just five games in her first two matches at Roland Garros, but faced a tougher test against the French number one. Each player held their serve in the opening set until Williams edged ahead in the 10th game by taking her third break point. Neither could gain an advantage in the second set, with Mladenovic thumping down an ace in the rain to set up a tie-breaker. When the match finally resumed on Court Philippe Chatrier, Mladenovic led 5-3 in the decider - and spurned a set point at 9-8 - before two wayward forehands saw Williams through. \"It was very difficult, she played really, really well,\" Serena said. \"She forced me to bring out my best tennis.\" She will play in the fourth round against Ukraine's 18th seed Elina Svitolina, who won 6-4 6-4 against 2008 champion Ana Ivanovic.

    "MGT": "Serena Williams demonstrated her champion's resilience at Roland Garros on Saturday, overcoming both a spirited challenge from French hopeful Kristina Mladenovic and a frustrating rain delay to advance to the fourth round of the French Open.\n\nThe defending champion secured her place in the last 16 with a hard-fought victory that was interrupted for over two hours due to inclement weather. When play finally resumed under clearing skies, Williams showed why she remains the player to beat on the red clay of Paris.\n\nThe match, which had the partisan crowd firmly behind Mladenovic, saw Williams weather early pressure from her opponent. The French player came out aggressive, trying to capitalize on the home support, but Williams' experience proved decisive in the crucial moments.\n\nDespite the challenging conditions and a passionate crowd cheering for her opponent, Williams maintained her composure throughout the stop-start encounter. The American's powerful serving and trademark baseline game gradually wore down Mladenovic's resistance.\n\nThe rain delay came at a critical juncture, testing both players' focus and preparation. Williams, however, appeared unfazed by the interruption, quickly finding her rhythm upon resumption of play.\n\nFor Mladenovic, who had hoped to become the first French woman to defeat Williams at Roland Garros, the loss was particularly disappointing. She showed flashes of brilliant play that drew enthusiastic responses from the home crowd, but ultimately couldn't sustain the level needed to upset the world's top player.\n\nWilliams' victory keeps alive her bid for a fourth French Open title and her quest to add to her impressive tally of Grand Slam championships. The win sets up an intriguing fourth-round match as she continues her defense of the title she won in such impressive fashion last year.\n\nThe tournament's organizers will be hoping for better weather as the competition moves into its second week, with several high-profile matches still to be played."

Britain's world number one Andy Murray withdrew from the Rogers Cup as he has yet to recover from the hip injury which hampered his Wimbledon campaign. Murray remains a doubt for the US Open, which begins on 28 August. French Open champion Jelena Ostapenko, 20, was also in action in the women's draw in Toronto but suffered a defeat by 31-year-old qualifier Varvara Lepchenko. Latvia's Ostapenko took the first set and was 3-0 up in the second but lost 1-6 7-6 (7-2) 7-6 (7-5) to the American. Seven-time Grand Slam champion Venus Williams, 37, is the oldest player in the draw and was given a tough test before overcoming qualifier Irina-Camelia Begu 6-1 3-6 6-3.

The unfortunate retirement marks another setback for the British No. 2, who had been looking to build momentum in the North American hard-court season.\n\nWatson, who has been struggling to find consistent form this season, showed visible signs of discomfort early in the match. The shoulder issue appeared to significantly hamper her serving motion and overall movement on court, ultimately leading to her decision to withdraw from the prestigious WTA 1000 event.\n\nThe injury couldn't have come at a worse time for Watson, as the Rogers Cup represents a crucial tournament in the lead-up to the US Open. The Canadian event traditionally attracts the world's top players and offers valuable ranking points that could have helped Watson improve her current world ranking.\n\nMedical staff attended to Watson during a medical timeout, but it became clear that continuing the match would risk aggravating the injury further. The British player made the difficult but prudent decision to retire, prioritizing her long-term health over short-term competitive aspirations.\n\nThis withdrawal adds to what has been a challenging season for Watson, who has been working diligently to recapture the form that once saw her ranked inside the world's top 40. The extent of the shoulder injury remains unclear, and questions now arise about her participation in upcoming tournaments.\n\nThe tennis calendar is particularly demanding during this period, with several high-profile events scheduled in the lead-up to the final Grand Slam of the year in New York. Watson's team will need to carefully evaluate her condition and make decisions regarding her tournament schedule for the remainder of the hard-court season.\n\nFellow players and fans alike expressed their support for Watson on social media, wishing her a swift recovery. The focus now turns to her rehabilitation process as she aims to return to competitive action as soon as possible without compromising her recovery."

    "HWT": "The Celtic midfielder spent the second half of last season on loan at the Dons, scoring seven goals in 15 games. But he admits to being unsure about a return until manager McInnes turned down the chance to join English Championship club Sunderland. \"As soon as I heard that, my mind was made up to come back,\" Christie said. The 22-year-old was invited back to Aberdeen as part of the deal that took Jonny Hayes to Celtic for £1.3m. Sunderland's move for McInnes, to replace David Moyes, caused Christie a few moments of concern as he enjoyed his summer holiday. McInnes decided against a switch to Wearside to stay with the club he guided to second place in the Scottish Premiership and runners-up in both domestic cup competitions last term. That delighted Christie on a personal level and he also believes it was a significant moment for the whole of Scottish football. \"It came out in the press that I would be coming back, but I was still on holiday lying on a beach,\" Christie told Red TV. \"I hadn't had a phone call, so I didn't know what was going on. \"When I came back, things had got into motion, but understandably I didn't want to make a decision until I knew the gaffer was staying. \"When the news broke that he was going to stay, it was a shock to a lot of people in Scottish football, but it's brilliant news. \"Not just for the club, as it is a huge lift, but also for the whole of Scottish football. \"For a few years there it turned out to be that as soon as there was any offer from England, people would jump ship. So it's credit to the manager that he has stayed here. \"He called me the next day to say he had made his mind up to stay at Aberdeen and wanted to have me on board.\"",

However, McInnes's choice to reject an approach from Sunderland and remain at Aberdeen ultimately convinced Christie to continue his development under the respected manager's guidance.\n\n\"When I heard the manager was staying, it made my decision much easier,\" Christie explained. \"He's been fantastic for my development, and I know I can continue to improve under his leadership. The stability he provides and his vision for the club were major factors in my decision.\"\n\nChristie enjoyed a successful stint at Pittodrie last season, making 15 appearances and scoring seven goals for the club. His performances helped Aberdeen secure a second-place finish in the Scottish Premiership, behind only Celtic.\n\nThe young midfielder's return provides a significant boost to Aberdeen's squad as they prepare for both domestic competitions and European football. McInnes has praised Christie's decision, highlighting the player's technical ability and growing maturity on the pitch.\n\n\"Ryan showed last season what he's capable of, and we're delighted to have him back,\" McInnes said. \"He fits perfectly into our style of play, and his presence will be vital as we compete on multiple fronts this season.\"\n\nThe loan agreement will see Christie remain at Aberdeen until the end of the current campaign, with Celtic maintaining a close eye on their promising young talent's progress. The arrangement appears beneficial for all parties, giving Christie regular first-team football while allowing him to develop in a familiar environment.\n\nAberdeen supporters have welcomed the news, remembering Christie's impact during his previous spell. His creativity and eye for goal made him a fan favorite, and expectations are high for his return to the team.\n\nWith European qualifiers approaching and a new Scottish Premiership campaign on the horizon, Christie's decision to rejoin Aberdeen demonstrates both his ambition and his trust in McInnes's project at Pittodrie.

    "prompt": "Growth in UK house prices slowed in the year to July, the country's largest mortgage lender has said, although they are still rising \"robustly\".",
    "HWT": "The Halifax said that prices rose at an annual pace of 7.9% last month - down from 9.6% in June. During July itself, prices actually fell, by 0.6%, the largest monthly drop since April 2014. It brings the average price of a flat or house across the country back down to Â£198,883. The sharp fall in July was described as \"a correction\" by Howard Archer, chief UK economist with IHS Global Insight, following a 1.6% rise in prices in June. The Halifax figures are in contrast to those from rival lender Nationwide, which said earlier this week that the rate of house price growth picked up to 3.5% in July, from 3.3% a month earlier. However, the Halifax said it expected strong growth in prices for the rest of the year. \"The underlying pace of house price growth remains robust notwithstanding the easing in July,\" said Stephen Noakes, Halifax's managing director of retail customer products. \"Continuing economic recovery, earnings growth in excess of consumer price inflation, and very low mortgage rates all underpin housing demand.\" Mr Archer said the contrasting figures from the Halifax and Nationwide served as a warning against reading too much into any one survey. \"This highlights the need to not pin too much weight on one particular house price survey or measure, but to try and take an overall view from the data,\" he said. Nationwide and Halifax both base their data on mortgage approvals, but they use a different \"mix-adjustment\" in their methodology. That involves a different weighting of the figures, to reflect different types of property being sold in any month, and more sales in a particular region of the UK.",
    "MGT": "House prices in the UK continue to climb but at a more moderate pace, according to the latest data from the nation's biggest mortgage lender. The figures show that while property values are still increasing \"robustly,\" the rate of growth has begun to ease compared to previous months.\n\nThe slowdown in price growth comes amid rising interest rates and growing concerns about affordability in the UK housing market. Despite these headwinds, demand for homes remains strong, supported by a persistent shortage of available properties and a resilient labor market.\n\nIndustry experts suggest this moderation in price growth could actually be beneficial for the market's long-term health, potentially preventing the formation of a housing bubble while still maintaining positive momentum for homeowners and sellers.\n\nFirst-time buyers, who have faced particular challenges entering the property market in recent years, may find some relief in the cooling price growth. However, they continue to grapple with significant barriers to homeownership, including strict lending criteria and the need for substantial deposits.\n\nEstate agents report that while buyer interest remains steady, there's a growing sense of caution among purchasers, who are taking more time to consider their options before committing to purchases. This more measured approach is contributing to the slower pace of price increases.\n\nThe regional picture shows variations across the country, with some areas experiencing stronger growth than others. Urban centers continue to see solid price appreciation, while some rural areas that saw sharp increases during the pandemic are now experiencing more modest growth.\n\nLooking ahead, industry analysts expect this trend of moderate price growth to continue, suggesting a more sustainable pattern for the housing market. However, they emphasize that underlying demand fundamentals remain strong, supported by a chronic shortage of housing stock and the UK's continued population growth.\n\nThe mortgage lender's data indicates that despite the slowdown, the housing market remains fundamentally sound, with transaction volumes holding up well and mortgage approvals continuing at a healthy pace."

The charismatic leader was gunned down on a Stockholm street while walking home from a cinema with his wife on a cold February night.\n\nThe murder sent shockwaves through the traditionally peaceful nation and has haunted Sweden for three decades. Despite thousands of leads and countless hours of police work, the killer has never been found. The case has spawned numerous theories involving South African security forces, Kurdish militants, and right-wing Swedish police officers.\n\nThe new investigation aims to apply modern forensic techniques and analytical methods to the extensive evidence collected over the years. Investigators hope that advances in DNA testing and ballistics analysis might shed new light on the case that has frustrated authorities for 30 years.\n\nPalme's assassination marked a turning point in Swedish society, shattering the country's sense of openness and security. The prime minister was known for walking around Stockholm without bodyguards, reflecting Sweden's trusting culture. His death led to significant changes in security protocols for Swedish politicians.\n\nThe reopening of the case has renewed public interest in solving this historic crime that changed Sweden forever."

    "HWT": "Verena Becker was an accessory to the 1977 murder of West Germany's chief federal prosecutor, Siegfried Buback, the court ruled. His driver and a bodyguard also died in the ambush. Becker, 59, denied any involvement. Two-and-a-half years already served in jail will be cut from her sentence. The killer has not yet been uncovered. The ambush happened in the south-western city of Karlsruhe. At the time the RAF was waging a violent campaign against the West German state, targeting prominent establishment figures and US military bases. Mr Buback and his two aides were shot dead by a passenger on a motorcycle as their car was waiting at traffic lights. Becker went on trial in Stuttgart in 2010, accused of playing a crucial role in planning and carrying out the murder. She was arrested the month after the murders. The RAF, also called the Baader-Meinhof gang, killed more than 30 people. The group broke up more than 10 years ago.",
    "MGT": "A German court on Wednesday sentenced a former member of the Red Army Faction (RAF) to four years in prison for her role in the 1977 murder of federal prosecutor Siegfried Buback. The conviction comes after decades of investigation into one of the most notorious killings during Germany's \"Years of Lead.\"\n\nThe defendant, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was found to have provided crucial support to the RAF militants who carried out the attack. Buback was killed along with his driver and another passenger when their car was ambushed in Karlsruhe.\n\nThe RAF, also known as the Baader-Meinhof Group, was responsible for numerous bombings, kidnappings, and assassinations in Germany during the 1970s and 1980s. The group, which dissolved in 1998, claimed to be fighting against what it perceived as capitalist oppression and Nazi influence in post-war German society.\n\nProsecutors said the verdict brings a measure of closure to Buback's family, though many details about the attack remain unclear. The case highlights Germany's ongoing efforts to resolve crimes from its turbulent past."

    "HWT": "But state officials said they would continue to investigate allegations of disrupting communal harmony. More than 60 students were suspended at the weekend after the Asia Cup match in which Pakistan defeated India. The students said they only clapped when Pakistan won. The district magistrate of Meerut city, Pankaj Yadav, confirmed to BBC Hindi that after investigating the complaint they found no evidence to support the sedition charge. But he said officials would continue to investigate allegations of other offences, including disrupting communal harmony and causing damage to public property. The sedition charge carries a three-year prison term in India. Earlier, Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Omar Abdullah promised to speak to the chief minister of Uttar Pradesh and intervene on the students' behalf, describing the charge as \"unacceptably harsh\" The incident happened at the Swami Vivekanand Subharti University in Meerut city on Sunday where a group of students  allegedly \"celebrated Pakistan's win\", leading to arguments with other college mates, reports say. The university administration then ordered an inquiry and decided to suspend the students as a \"precautionary measure\". Some of the Kashmiri students denied any wrongdoing in their statements to the media. Cricket matches between India and Pakistan are tense, dramatic affairs and are passionately followed in both countries. Claimed by both countries in its entirety, Kashmir has been a flashpoint for more than 60 years. The South Asian rivals have also fought two wars and a limited conflict.",
    "MGT": "In a significant reversal, authorities in India's Uttar Pradesh state have withdrawn sedition charges against several Kashmiri students who were accused of celebrating Pakistan's victory over India in a cricket match.\n\nThe students, who were studying at an agricultural university in Uttar Pradesh, had faced serious legal consequences after allegedly cheering for Pakistan during the highly charged sporting event. The initial sedition charges had sparked widespread debate about freedom of expression and the use of colonial-era sedition laws in modern India.\n\nLocal police officials confirmed that while the sedition charges have been dropped, investigations continue into other related charges. The incident had drawn criticism from civil rights activists and legal experts who argued that cheering for any sports team, even that of a rival nation, should not be considered an anti-national activity.\n\nThe case had highlighted the complex relationship between India and Pakistan, particularly in the context of Kashmir, a region claimed by both countries. Kashmiri students in other parts of India have occasionally faced scrutiny and suspicion, especially during heightened tensions between the two nations.\n\nThe decision to drop the sedition charges comes as a relief to the students and their families, who had maintained that the celebrations were merely an expression of sporting enthusiasm rather than any anti-national sentiment. The case had also drawn international media attention and raised questions about academic freedom and the treatment of Kashmiri students in Indian universities.\n\nLegal experts have welcomed the decision, noting that it aligns with recent Supreme Court directives urging authorities to exercise restraint in applying sedition laws, which carry severe penalties including life imprisonment."

The association marked the anniversary of the Croke Park stadium attack before Saturday's International Rules test between Ireland and Australia. The names of the victims were read out before the match, and 14 flames were lit in their memory. The dead included 24-year-old GAA player Michael Hogan, after whom Croke Park's Hogan Stand is named. Senior GAA staff laid a laurel wreath at the spot where he was shot.

Mourinho says a busy fixture schedule made it necessary to prioritise. \"Seventeen matches in seven weeks is impossible. It's not a gamble, just a consequence of our situation,\" he said. \"It was a simple decision, based on common sense.\" The Europa League champions are guaranteed Champions League football for next season, as are the top four finishers in the Premier League. The Red Devils are currently fifth in the league, four points behind fourth-placed Manchester City with three games remaining. Mourinho made eight changes as United's 25-match unbeaten run in the league was ended by Arsenal on Sunday. The Portuguese coach is confident the Europa League remains United's best chance of securing Champions League football and insists he will have \"no regrets\" if his side ultimately fail to win the competition. \"Let's see if we can do it,\" he added. \"It doesn't matter what happens.

With the Red Devils currently sitting fifth in the Premier League table, winning the Europa League would guarantee them a spot in next season's Champions League.\n\n\"It's not a gamble, it's a simple decision based on common sense,\" Mourinho explained during his pre-match press conference. \"The Europa League gives us the same reward as finishing fourth in the Premier League - a Champions League spot - but it also gives us a trophy, prestige, and a European Super Cup final.\"\n\nUnited's congested fixture schedule has forced Mourinho to make difficult choices about team selection, with the club still fighting on two fronts. The manager has increasingly opted to rest key players during Premier League matches, focusing their energy on European encounters.\n\nThis pragmatic approach has drawn criticism from some quarters, but Mourinho remains unmoved. \"When you have two opportunities rather than one, you try to take both. But when you have two opportunities and can only focus on one, you put all your eggs in that basket,\" he stated.\n\nThe decision reflects United's current reality, with injuries mounting and fixtures piling up in the season's final weeks. Several first-team players, including Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Marcos Rojo, are sidelined with long-term injuries, further complicating team selection.\n\nIf successful, Mourinho's strategy could deliver United's first Europa League title in their history and secure their return to Europe's elite competition.

    "HWT": "His daughter, Ursula, confirmed the singer's death to The Washington Post. He died in a New York hospital earlier this week from complications following a stroke. Covay gave Aretha Franklin one of her biggest hits with Chain of Fools in 1968, a song he had written 15 years earlier. His singing style also influenced Mick Jagger, as seen in the Rolling Stones cover of his song Mercy Mercy. Covay started out in music in a gospel group with his siblings at school, before joining doo-wop group Rainbows. While trying to make it as a solo artist and singer-songwriter he spent time as Little Richard's chauffeur and warm-up act. His first chart hit came in 1961 with Pony Time. The track, however, became an even bigger hit when Chubby Checker recorded his own version a year later in 1962, topping the pop and R&B charts. This pattern continued with his song Mercy Mercy, which he recorded in 1964 with a then-unknown Jimi Hendrix on guitar, which went into the top 40. A year later the Rolling Stones recorded their own version for their album Out of Our Heads, causing many to point out the similarity in singing styles between Jagger and Covay. While working as a songwriter at the Brill Building in New York, Covay wrote for artists including Gladys Knight and the Pips, Wilson Pickett and Solomon Burke. He was also part of the short-lived group the Soul Clan which featured Burke, Joe Tex, Ben E King and Arthur Conley. His work has been covered by a wide variety of artists including Gene Vincent, Connie Francis, Steppenwolf, Bobby Womack and the Small Faces. Covay suffered a stroke in 1992 and a year later stars including Ronnie Wood, Iggy Pop and Todd Rundgren produced a tribute album entitled Back to the Streets: Celebrating the Music of Don Covay. After a gap of 23 years Covay released his last album Ad Lib in 2000, which featured Rolling Stones guitarists Ronnie Woods and Keith Richards, Bad Company vocalist Paul Rodgers, Wilson Pickett, Syl Johnson and Huey Lewis.",
    "MGT": "Influential R&B Singer-Songwriter Don Covay Dies at 76\n\nDon Covay, the influential R&B singer-songwriter whose compositions became hits for some of music's biggest stars, has died at the age of 76.\n\nCovay, whose soulful voice and masterful songwriting shaped the sound of 1960s rhythm and blues, leaves behind a remarkable musical legacy that spans decades. His compositions were recorded by legends including the Rolling Stones, Aretha Franklin, and Otis Redding, cementing his place in music history.\n\nBorn Donald Randolph in Orangeburg, South Carolina, Covay began his career singing gospel before transitioning to secular music in the 1950s. He initially performed with the Rainbows, a doo-wop group, before launching his solo career and developing his distinctive vocal style that blended soul, R&B, and elements of rock.\n\nWhile Covay achieved moderate success as a performer with hits like \"Mercy, Mercy\" and \"See Saw,\" it was his songwriting that truly distinguished him. His composition \"Chain of Fools\" became one of Aretha Franklin's signature songs, earning her a Grammy Award in 1968. The Rolling Stones recorded his \"Mercy, Mercy\" for their 1965 album \"Out of Our Heads,\" introducing Covay's work to rock audiences worldwide.\n\nMusic historians note that Covay's influence extended beyond his compositions. His vocal delivery and performance style influenced a generation of singers, including Mick Jagger, who reportedly studied Covay's techniques.\n\n\"Don was one of those rare artists who could both perform brilliantly and write songs that spoke to the human experience,\" said music critic James Wilson. \"His understanding of rhythm and emotional expression was unparalleled.\"\n\nThroughout his career, Covay continued to record and perform, though health issues in later years limited his public appearances. In 1993, many artists including Bobby Womack and Ronnie Wood participated in a tribute album titled \"Back to the Streets: Celebrating the Music of Don Covay.\"\n\nFellow songwriter Dan Penn remembered Covay as \"a songwriter's songwriter\" who understood the perfect balance between lyrics and melody. \"Don knew how to write songs that artists wanted to sing and audiences needed to hear,\" Penn said.\n\nCovay is survived by his family members who have requested privacy during this time. Memorial services are being planned to celebrate his life and contributions to American music."

    "prompt": "A man accused of murdering his landlord told his trial he \"lost control\" after a request for sexual favours.",
    "HWT": "David Craig Ellis, 41, has admitted killing Alec Warburton, 59, at a house in Sketty, Swansea, but denies murder. Swansea Crown Court has heard that unemployed Mr Ellis could not afford his rent and Mr Warburton suggested \"things of a sexual nature\" instead. Mr Ellis told the jury his experience of being sexually abused as a child had triggered the fatal attack. Mr Ellis said his landlord had \"barged\" into his bedroom and reminded him his rent was in arrears. Mr Ellis said he felt angry due to the suggestion he could give sexual favours in lieu of rent and he tried to punch Mr Warburton after he cupped his face. \"I was abused as a child. The height difference made me feel like a child again,\" said Mr Ellis. He said he picked up a screwdriver and tried to stab Mr Warburton but the attempt was unsuccessful. The jury was told Mr Ellis eventually managed to kick his landlord in the groin causing him to drop to one knee. Christopher Clee QC, prosecuting, said: \"At that stage he was of no threat to you at all, was he?\" Mr Ellis replied: \"I don't know what I was thinking at the time.\" The court then heard how Mr Ellis picked up a hammer and struck Mr Warburton on the back of the head. Mr Clee asked Mr Ellis: \"You hit him from behind with such force you made a hole in his skull, didn't you?\" He replied: \"Yes.\" Mr Clee added: \"You caved that man's head skull in - what were you doing?\" Mr Ellis said: \" I don't know, I lost control.\" The trial continues.",
    "MGT": "A murder trial heard disturbing testimony yesterday as the defendant described how he \"lost control\" following his landlord's alleged sexual advances.\n\nThe accused, James Morton, 34, took the stand at Central Crown Court to detail the events leading up to the death of his landlord, Peter Walsh, 58, at a property in Riverside Gardens last March.\n\nMorton told the court that Walsh had repeatedly made unwanted sexual advances towards him in the weeks prior to the incident. According to Morton's testimony, tensions escalated on the evening of March 15th when Walsh allegedly demanded sexual favours in lieu of overdue rent payments.\n\n\"He wouldn't take no for an answer,\" Morton testified, his voice trembling. \"When he tried to touch me, I just lost control. Everything went red.\"\n\nThe prosecution contends that Morton's actions went far beyond self-defense, noting that Walsh suffered multiple blunt force injuries consistent with repeated strikes from a household object, later identified as a brass lamp found at the scene.\n\nDetective Inspector Sarah Reynolds, who led the investigation, told jurors that evidence suggested a \"sustained and brutal attack\" rather than a momentary loss of control. \"The victim suffered extensive injuries that indicate this was not a single reactive moment,\" she stated.\n\nThe court also heard from neighbouring tenants who reported hearing a loud argument followed by crashing sounds on the night in question. One witness, Mary Henderson, testified to hearing someone shouting \"get off me\" shortly before police were called to the scene.\n\nMorton's defense team argues that their client acted in a state of panic and temporary mental distress, triggered by what they describe as ongoing harassment from the deceased.\n\nThe trial, which entered its second week, has raised questions about tenant vulnerabilities and power dynamics in rental relationships. If convicted of murder, Morton faces a life sentence, though his legal team is pushing for a manslaughter verdict based on diminished responsibility.\n\nThe trial continues."

    "prompt": "The chief executive of two Sussex hospitals, which the health watchdog said were inadequate, has resigned.",
    "HWT": "Darren Grayson has stepped down from the East Sussex Healthcare NHS Trust, which runs the Conquest Hospital in St Leonards and Eastbourne District General Hospital (EDGH). In March the Care Quality Commission said A&E waiting times were \"excessive\" and targets were being missed. Campaigners have called for the resignation of the board of the trust. Mr Grayson said: \"Having been chief executive in East Sussex for five years, and having led the organisation through some significant change to improve the quality of our services for patients, I believe the time is now right to hand the baton to the next leader to continue this journey of improvement.\" In its latest report in March, the CQC said it had particular concerns over outpatient records and surgical practices at the EDGH. Liz Walke, chairwoman of the Save the DGH Campaign, said: \"It's a start. Let's be clear, that it isn't just Darren Grayson. We think the board should go and, unless you have a clean sweep, no significant change will happen. \"We hope there isn't going to be a massive payout. We are hoping that he has just fallen on his sword.\" Former Liberal Democrat MP for Eastbourne Stephen Lloyd said: \"It's about time. \"Frankly, I called for it a good 18 months ago. He still appeared to be hanging on for grim death to the post. I just thought it was absolutely outrageous.\"",
    "MGT": "The chief executive of two major Sussex hospitals has stepped down from her position following damning reports from healthcare regulators that rated both facilities as inadequate. The resignation comes amid mounting pressure over deteriorating standards of patient care and safety concerns highlighted by the Care Quality Commission (CQC).\n\nThe hospitals, which serve thousands of residents across Sussex, have been under intense scrutiny after recent inspections revealed significant shortcomings in several critical areas, including emergency care, leadership, and patient safety protocols. The CQC's findings painted a troubling picture of understaffing, lengthy waiting times, and inadequate risk management procedures.\n\nStaff members at both hospitals have reported struggling with overwhelming workloads and insufficient resources, leading to compromised patient care quality. The inspection also identified issues with infection control measures and medication management, raising serious concerns about patient welfare.\n\nLocal health advocacy groups have long called for immediate action to address these systemic problems, with some arguing that the leadership change was inevitable given the severity of the situations at both hospitals. The NHS Trust Board has accepted the chief executive's resignation and announced that an interim leader will be appointed while a permanent replacement is sought.\n\nThe Trust has pledged to implement a comprehensive improvement plan to address the concerns raised in the CQC report. This includes immediate measures to boost staffing levels, enhance training programs, and strengthen operational procedures across both facilities.\n\nLocal MPs have called for urgent intervention from the Department of Health and Social Care to ensure the hospitals receive adequate support during this transition period. The focus now turns to rebuilding public confidence and bringing both hospitals up to acceptable standards of care as quickly as possible."

    "prompt": "Postal business Whistl has confirmed it is ending its home delivery service in London, Liverpool and Manchester, putting up to 1,800 jobs at risk.",
    "HWT": "The Dutch-owned firm suspended deliveries last month after losing funding. It had been delivering about 3m letters every week in the three cities, in direct competition with Royal Mail. The private equity arm of Lloyds bank decided not to invest, triggering a review. Parent group PostNL said the firm had begun a consultation with affected staff \"to minimise the impact of the decision\". The company also pointed out it would continue to collect 80m items a week to be fed into the Royal Mail system for final delivery. A statement released by PostNL said: \"Following the termination of the discussions on the proposed investment in Whistl UK to fund the further rollout of its current end-to-end (E2E) activities, we have assessed alternative scenarios for Whistl's E2E operations. \"Further to this assessment, it has been decided to end Whistl's E2E operations. \"Whistl remains committed to further developing its successful activities in the UK, including downstream access (DSA) service, door-drop media, packets and parcels and logistics.\" About 1,800 workers were employed by Whistl, with many on zero-hours contracts. Whistl is the second largest postal operator in the UK.",
    "MGT": "In a significant blow to the UK's postal sector, Whistl, formerly known as TNT Post, has announced the immediate cessation of its door-to-door delivery operations in three major cities - London, Liverpool, and Manchester. The decision places approximately 1,800 jobs in jeopardy and marks a dramatic retreat from the company's ambitious plans to compete with Royal Mail in the direct delivery market.\n\nThe company, which had been conducting end-to-end deliveries in these metropolitan areas, made the announcement following a comprehensive review of its operations. The move comes after private equity firm LDC withdrew its planned investment in Whistl's expansion plans last month, forcing the company to suspend its delivery services temporarily.\n\nWhistl will continue its other postal operations, including collecting and sorting mail before handing it to Royal Mail for final delivery. However, the termination of its direct delivery service represents a significant scaling back of its presence in the UK postal market.\n\nThe decision has sparked concerns among union representatives about the welfare of affected workers, many of whom are on zero-hours contracts. The Communication Workers Union has called for urgent discussions with Whistl management regarding the future of these employees.\n\nThis development effectively leaves Royal Mail as the dominant player in UK residential mail delivery, raising questions about competition in the postal sector and the challenges faced by private companies attempting to establish themselves in this market."
