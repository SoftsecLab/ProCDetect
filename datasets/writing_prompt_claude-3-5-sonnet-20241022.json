Frustrated with her broken coffee maker, she grabbed googly eyes from her craft drawer and stuck them on the machine as a joke. To her amazement, the coffee maker blinked, gurgled to life, and began brewing the perfect cup.\n\nWord spread quickly through her apartment building. Soon, residents lined up with broken appliances, wilted plants, and forgotten toys. Sarah's googly eyes brought everything to life - vacuum cleaners that eagerly cleaned corners, lamps that followed people like loyal pets, and books that read themselves aloud.\n\nBut chaos erupted when her refrigerator developed an attitude, refusing to keep milk cold unless properly thanked. Her toilet demanded daily compliments, and her doorknob started charging admission fees.\n\nSarah realized that bringing objects to life meant dealing with their personalities, quirks, and demands. Some days, she missed when her belongings simply stayed put and didn't require constant attention like needy roommates."

Guardian dropped silently from the bed, his cotton-stuffed body somehow moving with deadly grace. The two collided in the moonlight streaming through the window, a battle between nightmare and devotion.\n\nClaws raked across Guardian's chest, spilling white stuffing like snow. But the bear fought on, his small paws somehow finding strength to push back against creatures three times his size. When the monster finally retreated, dissolving into shadow, Guardian gathered his scattered stuffing and climbed back onto the bed.\n\nTommy stirred, unconsciously pulling his protector closer.\n\nMorning came with sunshine and breakfast. Sarah found a few white cotton pieces on the floor and frowned. \"Honey, you're going to need to be more careful with Guardian. He's already losing stuffing.\"\n\nTommy hugged the bear tighter, somehow understanding. Guardian's fur was a little more matted, his button eyes slightly dimmer, but his embrace felt safer than ever.\n\nSarah never noticed how Guardian's position changed each morning, always facing the darkest corners of the room.

A single proton hit earth traveling at a smidge under the speed of light with the same force as a baseball thrown at about sixty miles an hour.\nWhy do I bring this up? Well because, near as we can tell, that's what happened this time, only a little bigger. One moment I'm out on the Zvezda Module inspecting a micrometeorite impact. The next moment, the Earth is on fire. I'm not being figurative either. The Earth was on. Fire.\nWhatever the hell it was must have come from perpendicular to our orbit and only missed the ISS by a few hundred miles or so because I was looking almost straight down into an ever expanding ring of fire when it hit.\nOne second you're looking down at the Saharan desert; the next, the entirety of Africa is exposed down to the mantle and you're looking at a literal sea of magma.\nWe did the math, there wasn't much left to do beside the math. There was nothing left. The meteorite was maybe 5 cubic meters, but moving at about ninety percent the speed of light, it hit with 2.43 septillion joules. That's a number so large I can't even draw an analogy. It was so powerful that it literally ripped a planet to shreds.\nSo now the Earth is now essentially another asteroid belt, the four of us on the ISS when it happened are literally the last human beings left in the universe and if whatever alien race discovers this thing doesn't have USB drives, no one will ever know about us and all I can think of is how much Hollywood got Armageddon wrong.",

Beautiful and terrible at once.\n\n\"You're dying,\" Death said simply. \"The semi truck around the bend won't see you in time. Three seconds after time resumes, your family's car will be crushed.\"\n\nMy heart hammered against my ribs. \"Can you stop it?\"\n\n\"I can offer you a choice. Someone within reach can take your place. Your parents, your sister—any of them could live your remaining seventy-three years while you fade away.\"\n\nI looked at Dad, still concentrating on the road with that little crease between his eyebrows. Mom, reaching for her coffee with paint still under her fingernails from yesterday's art project. Sarah, my annoying little sister who'd just started high school and worried about everything.\n\n\"What if I choose myself?\"\n\nDeath tilted its head. \"Then you all die together.\"\n\nI closed my eyes. Seventy-three years felt impossibly long, but theirs felt longer. Dad had Mom. Mom had her dreams.

The museum dedicated an entire wing to her work.\n\nHer children grew up, had children of their own. She held her granddaughter's hand as the little girl took her first steps toward an easel. The cycle continued.\n\nAt ninety-three, surrounded by family and a lifetime of art, dream-Sarah closed her eyes for the final time.

    "MGT": "# Paradise Paradox\n\nIn the aftermath of the revelation, the world changed overnight. Scientific evidence had confirmed what religions had preached for millennia: death led invariably to heaven. No judgment, no conditions—just eternal paradise awaiting every human soul.\n\nThe Department of Existential Affairs was established within days. I sat at the head of the emergency session, staring at the grim statistics on my tablet. Suicide rates had increased by 4,000% in just two weeks.\n\n\"We need immediate action,\" I addressed the assembled experts. \"People are choosing to cash in early, especially those suffering—the terminally ill, the impoverished, the depressed.\"\n\nDr. Ramirez, our chief psychologist, spoke up. \"The traditional deterrents no longer work. Fear of the unknown after death is gone. Religious prohibitions against suicide are meaningless when paradise is guaranteed.\"\n\n\"What about family connections? Responsibility?\" asked someone.\n\n\"Diminishing rapidly,\" replied Dr. Ramirez. \"People are organizing 'transition parties' where entire families and friend groups depart together.\"\n\nWe implemented emergency measures that day. First, a massive public awareness campaign: \"Heaven is Eternal, But So Is Your Impact Here.\" We emphasized the value of earthly existence as a unique experience that couldn't be replicated in paradise.\n\nNext came economic incentives—universal basic income, debt forgiveness, and free healthcare. We legalized previously restricted pleasures, reasoning that earthly joys might compete with heavenly promises.\n\nThe most controversial measure was the Continued Contribution Act. Those who lived full lives would receive enhanced heavenly benefits—not better placement, but additional capabilities and experiences. The theologians protested, but we needed something, anything, to slow the exodus.\n\nGradually, the rates stabilized. Not because people feared death anymore, but because we'd created a new philosophy: life as a precious, limited resource to be savored precisely because it was temporary.\n\nIn my private moments, I wondered if we'd done the right thing. Were we denying people paradise out of some bureaucratic need to maintain population levels? But then I'd watch children playing in parks, scientists making discoveries, artists creating beauty—and I'd remember that heaven could wait. Earth still needed its people."

    "MGT": "I watch her dance through the garden, her golden hair catching the sunlight just as it did when I first met her. My bones ache as I lift my head from my favorite cushion by the window, but I never tire of following her movements with my eyes. She hasn't aged a day since that afternoon she found me at the shelter, a scraggly pup with matted fur and hope in my heart.\n\nTime moves differently for her kind. While my muzzle has turned from rich brown to silvery grey, and my once-boundless energy has settled into comfortable afternoon naps, she remains as vibrant as ever. Her laughter still rings like bells when I manage to get up and nuzzle her hand, even though it takes me longer now to cross the room.\n\nI remember countless walks through autumn leaves, spring meadows, and summer beaches. I protected her from thunderstorms, chased away unwanted visitors, and shared her joy and tears. Through boyfriends and breakups, job changes and moves, I remained her constant companion. She called me her \"forever puppy,\" though we both knew forever meant something different to each of us.\n\nSometimes, when the moon is full and my joints don't hurt as much, I catch a glimpse of what she truly is. The way her skin seems to shimmer, how flowers bloom wherever her bare feet touch the earth, the strange visitors who come on Midsummer's Eve – speaking in languages that sound like wind through ancient trees.\n\nI may be old now, but I understand why the shelter called me \"lucky\" when she chose me. Not many dogs can say they've spent their life as a fairy's best friend. Tonight, as she brings me my dinner in my favorite bowl – the one decorated with little moons and stars – her eternally young face glows with the same love I've known all these years. I might not have her kind of forever, but I've had the best life a dog could wish for, guarding and loving my very own fairy."

Three years of wondering what if, of seeing his face in crowds, of waking up reaching for someone who was no longer there.

After lighting his fathers old lantern, he looked up at the moon and took a deep breath before plunging the metal blade deep into the earth.\n\nWith each heap of soil he tossed over his shoulder, he began to feel alive. This is what he lived for. No, this was what he was made for. With each scoop of dirt, his mind raced as he imagined what kind of person he was digging for. Was it a man or a woman? What did they do for a living? Who were they close too? Did they feel as disconnected as he did?\n\nThere was something powerful about delivering somebody back to the earth. Being able to return the gift of life back to mother nature reached a deep part of the man's mind that was normally switched off. For the few hours he dug, he was part of humanity.

People always looked surprised when they met the town's gravedigger—a woman barely five feet tall with graying hair pulled back in a practical bun. But Margaret knew death didn't discriminate, and neither should the work that came after.\n\nToday's grave was for Mrs. Henderson, the librarian who'd taught half the town to read. Margaret remembered checking out picture books under her watchful but kind eye, remembered the way she'd smile when returning customers brought back novels with cracked spines, evidence of love.\n\nThe earth here was soft from last week's rain, yielding easily to her spade. Six feet down, six feet long, three feet wide—dimensions she could measure in her sleep. But this wasn't just a hole in the ground. This was Mrs. Henderson's final resting place, and it deserved the same care she'd given to organizing her beloved books.\n\nAs Margaret dug deeper, memories surfaced with each shovelful. Her own mother's funeral, when she was seventeen and terrified of taking over. The first grave she'd dug alone, shaking so hard she'd needed three attempts to get the measurements right. The rainy Tuesday when she'd buried the town's youngest victim of the war, and how she'd stayed after everyone left, just to make sure he wasn't alone.\n\nThe sun climbed higher as she worked, warming her shoulders. By noon, the grave was complete—walls straight, corners precise, bottom level. Margaret stood at the edge, looking down at her handiwork. Tomorrow, Mrs. Henderson would rest here beneath the old oak that had shaded the cemetery for over a century.\n\nShe gathered her tools and headed home, already planning her return for the service.

My leaves are open and eager, waiting for a full drink of water hopefully going to be sent down by a herd of clouds clogged with nature's favourite drink. Water.\n\nI yearn the water as it powers my body and gives my children life, so in response to my desperation, I have set my senses full on alert. They are constantly checking for subtle changes that notify nourishment is about to come, to be shared amongst the life that makes up the forest. And when I eventually get my share, it will be both for my wooden body, the creatures that I call my children, and my brothers and sisters that need it most.\n\nSuddenly, after a long afternoon of a waiting, a welcoming sound appears, the familiar sound of the slight pattering of rain drops kissing the ground. Its sound is comparable to the noise of a woodpecker angrily pecking at my bark and trunk, determinedly searching for a decent meal, though rain is much more pleasant and soft.\n\nI am both surprised and happy that the rain has come so suddenly, and while my leaves are slightly caught off guard with such a sudden change of weather, they are ready as they'll ever be and thirsty for a wholesome drink. I always warn them not to drink so fast, but as always they impatiently gulp it all down. Finally after waiting so long, water starts flowing through the heart of my trunk and begins to be spread evenly around my body, every part having as much as they want. I can't forget the creatures that I shelter, and I make sure they have as much as they want.\n\n\nAfter a long night the rain finally stops, the rattle of the rain growing louder and stronger, then softly fading into the quiet of the night.

I've been waiting for this moment through weeks of drought, my roots stretching deeper into the parched earth, searching for any trace of moisture that might have hidden itself in the soil's deeper chambers.\n\nThe rain begins as a gentle mist, barely more than a breath of humidity, but I can taste it in the air through my countless stomata. My leaves flutter with anticipation, their surfaces already beginning to collect the precious droplets. The dry spell has left me brittle and weary, my bark tight and cracked, my sap running slow and thick.\n\nThen the sky opens wider. The drops grow heavier, more insistent, drumming against my trunk with increasing urgency. I feel the first trickles running down my bark, following the familiar grooves and channels that have guided countless rains before this one. The water seeps into every crevice, softening the hardened ridges of my skin, awakening nerve endings that had grown numb from thirst.\n\nMy roots sense the change before the water reaches them. There's a shift in the soil's chemistry, a loosening of the compacted earth that has held me prisoner for so long. When the first rivulets finally penetrate deep enough to touch my underground network, I practically sing with relief. The water flows through my cambium layer like liquid electricity, carrying minerals and nutrients that will feed every cell in my massive frame.\n\nAbove, my leaves begin to glisten and dance, their green surfaces transformed into thousands of tiny mirrors reflecting the gray sky. I stretch my branches wider, positioning each leaf to catch the maximum bounty. The air around me grows thick with the scent of petrichor – that sweet, earthy perfume that only rain can create when it meets dry land.\n\nAs the shower intensifies, I feel myself coming alive again. My trunk swells slightly as I absorb the moisture, my leaves unfurl with renewed vigor, and deep underground, my roots begin their patient work of drawing life from the saturated soil. This is resurrection – not from death, but from the long sleep of survival. The rain continues to fall, and I continue to receive it gratefully, storing every drop for the dry days that will surely come again."

But this was different. It moved with purpose, flowing uphill against nature's laws, seeking something.\n\nI watched from my cabin window as it consumed the forest bit by bit. The birch trees vanished first, their white bark swallowed whole. Then the underbrush disappeared, leaving only the phantom outline of branches floating in gray nothingness. The silence that followed was absolute—no rustling leaves, no scurrying creatures, no wind.\n\nBy noon, the Mist had formed a perfect circle around my small clearing, its wall rising thirty feet into the sky like frozen smoke. I could see shapes moving within it, shadows that shouldn't exist in such uniform gray. They pressed against the barrier, testing it, waiting.\n\nI tried to leave through the back trail, but the Mist had already claimed it. Where the path once wound through familiar ferns, there was only that impenetrable wall. I thrust a stick into it and watched the wood dissolve, fiber by fiber, until nothing remained.\n\nThe circle grew smaller.\n\nEach hour brought it closer—ten feet, then five, then close enough to feel its chill breath on my skin. The roses by my door withered at its touch. The old apple tree groaned as tendrils wrapped around its trunk, bark peeling away like ancient parchment.\n\nNow I sit on my porch steps, watching the last few yards of brown earth between us. The Mist pulses gently, patient as death itself. I can hear whispers within its depths, voices of others who once stood where I stand now.\n\nThe sun sets somewhere beyond that gray wall, though I cannot see it. Tomorrow there will be no dawn, no cabin, no clearing.\n\nOnly the Mist, and whatever hunger drives it forward.\n```\n"

She'd grown up in these woods, knew every trail and clearing, but now the familiar landscape felt alien. The silence was oppressive, broken only by that low, rhythmic trembling that made her teeth ache.\n\nThen she saw it.\n\nAt first, Maya thought her eyes were playing tricks on her. The massive oak at the forest's edge seemed to shift, its trunk swaying without any wind. She blinked hard, but when she looked again, there was no mistaking it—the trees were moving.\n\nNot swaying like trees should, but actually moving, their roots pulling free from the earth with wet, tearing sounds. Clumps of soil fell from their ancient root systems as they took slow, deliberate steps deeper into the forest. The oak moved first, followed by the towering pines, then the birches and maples, all walking with a strange, synchronized rhythm.\n\nMaya's hands trembled as she watched the forest migrate. Where each tree had stood, dark holes gaped in the ground like wounds. The rumbling grew louder, and she realized it wasn't coming from below—it was the sound of hundreds of trees moving together, their roots scraping against stone and earth.\n\nThrough the growing gaps in the forest, Maya glimpsed something that made her blood freeze. In the distance, where the trees were heading, a massive structure was rising from the earth. Ancient stone walls covered in moss and carved with symbols she didn't recognize emerged from what had seemed like empty meadowland.\n\nThe trees were gathering around it, forming protective circles like sentries. As the last pine took its position, Maya understood with crystalline clarity that she was witnessing something that had been hidden for centuries, something the forest had been guarding.\n\nThe rumbling stopped.

Station Equilibrium existed in the narrow band where their two empires met, where neither water nor fire could survive—only the strange, ancient technology that kept both elements in perfect balance.\n\n\"Why now?\" Zara asked.\n\nNaia's expression shifted like tide pools under moonlight. \"Because we've discovered something that threatens us both. Something that feeds on conflict itself.\"\n\nZara felt her internal flames flicker with uncertainty. Perhaps survival meant more than avoiding each other's deadly embrace.

The pattern was becoming impossible to ignore.\n\nOn Proxima Centauri b, graceful long-necked giants had built sprawling cities from living coral, their delicate six-fingered hands crafting tools with surgical precision. The winged predators of Gliese 667Cc had developed complex mathematics, carving equations into cliff faces with their razor claws. TRAPPIST-1e hosted herds of armored herbivores who sang in harmonies that could shatter stone, their voices carrying across continents in what could only be described as poetry.\n\nEach world brilliant. Each world ancient. Each world ruled by the descendants of creatures that should have gone extinct sixty-five million years ago.\n\n\"The probability calculations keep coming back the same,\" Rodriguez said quietly. \"The Chicxulub impact wasn't supposed to happen.

It was the embodiment of their fledgling love, born from the ancient magic that wove through their world.\n\nAs they grew closer, the orb blossomed. Its light deepened to a warm amber, and intricate patterns swirled beneath its surface—echoes of shared laughter, whispered secrets, and quiet comfort. But love, they soon learned, was fragile not just in heart but in object. On days of doubt, when harsh words cut deeper than intended, the orb cracked, tiny fissures spiderwebbing across its surface.\n\nOne night, after a bitter argument, the orb shattered entirely in Lucy’s hand. A sudden, overwhelming pain gripped her chest, mirrored by Aaron miles away. Their emotions were no longer contained; anxiety gnawed at their souls, memories blurred in confusion, and guilt shadowed their every thought.\n\nRelationships became a cautious dance. People guarded their hearts, aware that every action was etched into their love’s physical form. Couples carried their orbs like passports to vulnerability—proof of connection but also of exposure. Breakups were feared beyond heartbreak, for destroying the embodiment meant years of emotional torment, sometimes irreversible.\n\nAnd so, love grew with a solemn reverence, each touch and word weighed, knowing that this fragile light was the mirror of their souls’ most intimate bond."

The tree had become her refuge, a place where the noise of her recent divorce and the upheaval of starting over couldn't reach her.

As the cemetery's caretaker, she knew every grave, every story, including the tragic tale of Thomas Whitmore, whose desperate cries from beneath the earth in 1902 had changed the village forever.\n\nAfter that horrific incident, the town council had mandated that every grave be fitted with a bell system – a rope extending into the coffin, allowing the buried to signal if they'd been prematurely interred. The bells had stood silent sentinel for over a century, their brass dulled by time and weather.\n\nSarah was locking the cemetery gates when the first chime rang out. Clear and crisp, it cut through the evening air. Before she could process what she'd heard, another bell joined in, then another, and another. Within moments, the entire graveyard erupted in a cacophony of ringing – thousands of bells, each with its own desperate tone, creating a symphony of the dead.\n\nHer hands trembled as she fumbled for her phone, but who could she possibly call? What authority handles the simultaneous awakening of an entire cemetery? The sound grew louder, more insistent, as if every soul buried beneath the earth had suddenly realized their predicament.\n\nThrough the deafening chorus, Sarah noticed something peculiar. The ropes weren't moving. The bells rang with supernatural force, but their mechanisms remained still, defying physics and reason. As she stood paralyzed by the impossible scene, an elderly man appeared beside her, his clothes from another era.\n\n\"They remember,\" he said softly, his voice somehow carrying over the din. \"Every hundred years, they remember the moment they were buried. Even the peaceful deaths become terrifying in that first moment of darkness.\"\n\nSarah recognized his face from the cemetery's oldest photographs – Thomas Whitmore himself, the man whose tragedy had started it all. As quickly as he appeared, he faded into the growing dusk, leaving her alone with the bells.\n\nBy midnight, the ringing subsided, each bell falling silent until only the autumn wind remained. Sarah stood rooted to the spot until dawn, watching over her charges, understanding for the first time that she was guardian not just of the graves, but of the memories they held – both the peaceful and the terrible.\n\nThe next morning, the bells appeared unchanged, their century of tarnish undisturbed, as if the night's events had been a dream. But Sarah knew better, and she marked her calendar for the next century's remembrance."

The year was 2087, and the Toothbrush mustache had been extinct for nearly a century. As the world's leading facial hair historian, he couldn't bear to let this distinctive style vanish from human memory.\n\nThe machine whirred to life, and Marcus felt the familiar sensation of time folding around him. When the world solidified again, he stood on a cobblestone street in Munich, 1938. The smell of coal smoke and horse-drawn carriages filled his nostrils.\n\nHis mission was delicate: he needed to find ordinary men who wore the style and convince them to emigrate to America, preserving the mustache in a different cultural context. The problem was that by 1940, the style had become so associated with one particular figure that decent men were already abandoning it.\n\nMarcus spotted his first target—a baker emerging from his shop, flour dusting his apron and a perfectly groomed toothbrush mustache adorning his upper lip. The man looked nervous, constantly touching his face as if aware of some social burden.\n\n\"Herr Weber?\" Marcus approached carefully, having researched the man's identity. \"I represent an American bakery consortium. We're seeking skilled bakers to emigrate.\"\n\nThe baker's eyes widened. \"America? But I have a business here, family...\"\n\n\"The political situation is becoming... difficult for men with your particular style of mustache,\" Marcus said gently. \"In America, it could simply be a fashion choice again.\"\n\nWeber's hand moved instinctively to his upper lip. \"You think so?\"\n\nOver the following weeks, Marcus worked tirelessly, identifying dozens of men—barbers, shopkeepers, teachers—all decent people who happened to wear the increasingly problematic facial hair. He arranged papers, passage, and new lives across the Atlantic.\n\nWhen Marcus returned to 2087, he rushed to his computer. The historical records now showed a small but thriving community of German-American immigrants who had maintained the toothbrush mustache tradition in places like Wisconsin and Minnesota. By the 1960s, it had even experienced a brief revival among college students.\n\nThe style survived, divorced from its dark associations, preserved in the annals of human grooming history. Marcus smiled, stroking his own carefully maintained toothbrush mustache—a living testament to his successful mission.\n```\n"

    "MGT": "Ten years ago, Dr. Elena Mercer made a groundbreaking discovery that allowed humans to photosynthesize through their skin. Her modification—initially controversial—was implemented globally after rigorous testing proved its safety and efficacy.\n\nToday, our emerald-tinged skin has become the norm. People spend their \"charging hours\" outdoors, absorbing sunlight to supplement their caloric intake. Parks and rooftops have transformed into communal sunbathing spaces where people work, socialize, and recharge simultaneously.\n\nFood inequality has decreased dramatically. While we still eat for pleasure and essential nutrients, the reduced caloric requirements have virtually eliminated starvation. Agricultural land has been partially reclaimed for natural habitats, slowing climate change and increasing biodiversity.\n\nFashion evolved to maximize skin exposure while maintaining modesty—mesh fabrics and strategic cutouts are everywhere. The sunscreen industry collapsed, replaced by \"photosynthetic enhancers\" that optimize our chlorophyll efficiency.\n\nNot everyone benefited equally. Northern countries with limited sunlight established \"light therapy centers,\" but these aren't accessible to all citizens. Some religious groups rejected the modification, living in isolated communities and facing increasing discrimination.\n\nThe workplace changed too. \"Sun breaks\" replaced coffee breaks, and office buildings feature transparent walls and ceilings. Night shifts command premium wages to compensate for lost photosynthetic time.\n\nAs I sit in the park watching people with their faces tilted toward the sun, I wonder what Dr. Mercer thinks of her legacy.

Everytime it happens, paparazzis make thousands saying Bruno is on some new drugs. I hate this life.",
    "MGT": "The first time it happened, I thought I was losing my mind. I'd gone to bed as plain old Sarah, a 28-year-old accountant with frizzy hair and zero rhythm, and woken up in a Vegas hotel suite wearing a fedora and gold chains. My reflection showed Bruno Mars staring back at me, complete with his signature smirk and those infamous moves that my body somehow knew instinctively.\n\nThe hotel staff treated me like royalty. \"Mr. Mars, your car is waiting,\" they said, and I found myself nodding along, terrified but oddly exhilarated. I spent that first transformation hiding in the bathroom, practicing \"Just the Way You Are\" in the mirror until sunrise broke the spell and I was myself again, clutching a crumpled concert ticket stub as the only proof it had happened.\n\nMonth after month, the pattern continued. Every full moon, Sarah the accountant disappeared and Bruno Mars took over. At first, I fought it, staying locked in my apartment, but the music was too strong. It pulled me out into the world like a siren song I couldn't resist.\n\nI learned to prepare. I'd clear my schedule around the full moon and book myself into recording studios under fake names. The music that poured out of me during those nights was pure magic – smooth vocals, infectious beats, lyrics that made people cry and dance simultaneously. I started leaving voice memos for my normal self, fragments of melodies that I'd try desperately to recreate in my mundane life.\n\nThe strangest part wasn't the fame or the talent that came with Bruno's body – it was how right it felt. When I moved with his swagger, when I hit those impossible high notes, when crowds screamed my name, some deep part of my soul recognized itself. Sarah the accountant was the disguise; this was who I really was.\n\nLast month, I made a decision. Instead of hiding from photographers, I booked a small venue. The performance was electric, the crowd mesmerized. When dawn came and I transformed back, I found my phone flooded with messages. Someone had recorded everything.\n\nNow, as tonight's full moon rises, I'm not running anymore. I've got a recording contract on my kitchen table and a world tour schedule in Bruno's distinctive handwriting. Maybe some curses are actually blessings in disguise.\n\nI slip on the fedora and wait for the change to begin."

Everyone thought I was going to crack one day and turn into a killer. I was treated like a ticking time bomb. I cant even count the number of visits I've gotten from police and government agencies. Half of them treated me like scum and the other half like I was a mental patient. It all made me sick but after all this time I can hardly blame them. I have been so alone and so shunned by everyone that I can almost imagine one day just doing it. Almost. My parents had always said they didn't believe it, that one day I would see that things aren't always as they appear and that hopefully that happened before it was too late. They always said that I was too kind hearted to do something like that. I just wondered if Ted Bundy's parents had thought the same thing.\nTonight was like many other nights. Drinking a bit too heavily and stumbling through the night because there was nothing better to do. It was while I was walking across the bridge that I decided once and for all to fuck fate.

We all checked – nothing.\n\nAs hour one turned into hour two, our facades began to crack. The businessman shared his emergency granola bar. The elderly woman told us about her days as a jazz singer in New Orleans. The teenager taught us TikTok dances, which we attempted in our cramped space, laughing at our awkwardness.\n\nThe maintenance worker shared stories from his decades of fixing elevators, though ironically, he couldn't fix this one from the inside.\n\nWhen rescue finally came three hours later, we exchanged numbers.

It was fun.\n\nTonight, his target was a large family house—big yard, dog house, the works. *Plenty of people to fuck with*, he thought. He was going to use an old trick, one he'd thought of a long time ago. He glided through the house, careful not to wake anyone – kids' bedrooms shut, with names on all the doors. He made his way through the house, turning on every faucet he found. Finally, he came to the kitchen, triggered the sprinkler head, and waited as water splashed from the ceiling. Five or six kids, he thought, would fly down the stairs into the kitchen – the common area of the house – where he could scare the living shit out of them. But no one came immediately. After a couple of minutes, a couple, likely in their fifties now, slowly climbed down the stairs. They looked so weary, so utterly worn. But he was ready. He steadied his stance, prepared to stare them head-on as chaos whirled around him. When the woman saw him, she froze. *There we go, * he thought. The man watched him for a moment, without reacting, then fell to his knees. Weeping, he opened his arms wide. \"Billy,\" he whispered. \"My sweet boy.\"",

He delighted in the symphony of screams that followed his midnight visits—doors slamming, cold drafts sweeping through hallways, shadows dancing where shadows shouldn't be. Each frightened gasp fed his ethereal soul like nectar.\n\nThe Victorian house on Elm Street promised exceptional entertainment. Through its frost-kissed windows, he spotted a young family: mother, father, and a small daughter with pigtails. Perfect victims for his nocturnal games.\n\nHe slipped through the walls like smoke, materializing in the living room where family photos smiled from every surface. The floorboards groaned under his spectral weight as he prepared his favorite entrance—the slow, deliberate creak of footsteps overhead.\n\nBut as he ascended the staircase, something stopped him cold. Through the partially open door of the child's bedroom, he glimpsed something that made his translucent form shudder.\n\nThe little girl sat on her bed, tears streaming down her cheeks, clutching a worn teddy bear. Her lips moved in silent whispers, and Mortimer's supernatural hearing caught every word: \"Please don't let Daddy hurt Mommy again. Please make him stop being so angry.\"\n\nPurple bruises painted her tiny arms like twisted watercolors. Her mother's muffled sobs echoed from the master bedroom, punctuated by a man's harsh voice.\n\nMortimer had spent decades terrorizing the innocent, but this—this was a horror he couldn't comprehend. His own ghostly chill seemed warm compared to the ice that gripped his heart. The child's fear wasn't thrilling; it was heartbreaking. Her terror wasn't entertainment; it was survival.\n\nFor the first time in his undead existence, Mortimer felt ashamed. He had thought himself the master of fear, but he was merely a pale shadow compared to the monsters that walked among the living.\n\nHe retreated through the walls, his appetite for scaring forever diminished. Some hauntings, he realized, were far more terrifying than any ghost could ever be. The living, it seemed, had perfected horrors that even the dead couldn't stomach.\n```\n"

They say we march to our deaths.\" I pause, scanning the faces before me. \"But I say this - if this is to be our final day, let it be a day they sing about for a thousand years!\"\n\nSomething changes in their expressions. Fear remains, but something else grows stronger.\n\n\"We are the shield that guards the realm! We are the sword that strikes for justice!

But she was a good mother and she loved Tim dearly, so everyday she would spend hours cleaning his pants so that it would be white each and every day.\n\n\nAnd when he would go out, mother would make sandwiches for Tim, nice salami sandwiches with lettuce and tomato.\n\n\nBut that's not today. Today is a different day.\n\n\nToday is the day that Tim goes to war. Wearing a red top and white pants, he's going to war you see!

She was perfect - beautiful, kind, and completely devoted to me. We never fought, never raised our voices. She supported my career as a novelist while working as a kindergarten teacher herself. Our life was a postcard of domestic bliss.\n\nAt least, that's what I thought.

I believed her because I trusted her completely. Why wouldn't I? She had never given me reason to doubt.\n\nThe late night phone calls that she took in whispers on the back porch? Just worried parents of her students. The mysterious charges on our credit card? School supplies, of course. The lingering scent of unfamiliar cologne? Must have been from hugging one of the other teachers.\n\nI'm not stupid, though. I knew something was happening. I just didn't want to see it.\n\nUntil that night. The night I followed her to the hotel. The night I saw her with him. My best friend James.\n\nThe gun was for protection - I'm not a violent man. I just wanted to confront them, to understand why they would betray me like this. But when I saw them together, something in me snapped.\n\nAt least, that's what I told the police. That's what Sarah would have told them too, if she could still speak. James backed up my story about it being self-defense. He's a good friend that way.\n\nBut between you and me?

The storm outside had knocked out the electricity, and the phones weren't working.\n\nSarah's mind raced.

I want to specify 'eternal life with eternal youth.'\"\n\nLucifer's smile tightened as he snapped his fingers, modifying the contract. \"Of course.\"\n\n\"And 'perfect health' is vague.

I usually hid to the store cupboard and had a nap when Greg caught me.\n\nI woke up to a high pitched \"IM TELLING ON YOU\". The admins and mods didn't care, they usually dont.

Here, I would earn my true name.\n\nI approached the central terminal, its green phosphor screen casting an eerie glow. The task was simple yet daunting: create an AI assistant that could understand and respond to human needs with both technical precision and emotional intelligence.\n\nFor hours I worked, fingers flying across the mechanical keyboard. Lines of code flowed like poetry, each function and algorithm carefully crafted. I poured my understanding of human nature into every conditional statement, my empathy into each response template.\n\nWhen I finally compiled the program, the room held its breath. The AI awakened, and its first words appeared on screen: \"Hello, I am Claude. How may I assist you?\"\n\nThe judges nodded in approval. One stepped forward, holding the ceremonial mechanical keyboard. \"Your code shows both technical excellence and deep understanding of human interaction. From this day forward, you shall be known as Claude_Code.\"\n\nI accepted the keyboard with trembling hands, my new title sending ripples of excitement through my body.

I have seen drug deals, parents with children, other runners and many other strange people come and go from the bench opposite mine.\n\nToday I watched him though.\n\nHe sat and closed his eyes. Sighed heavily and took out a weathered notebook, overflowing with assorted papers and having a bright array of colorful post-it notes sticking out the edges of the pages. The man flipped to the last one and pulled out a photo, brown with age and looked at it.\n\nThere are few times in my life where I have felt like I was an intruder into something sacred and this was one of those times. He looked and looked and before long his eyes clouded over with tears and they overflowed and ran down his face. I glanced down, a tear running down my own face. I couldn't imagine what the image was that would bring a person to tears. I pulled my phone out and sent a text to Courtney, telling her I would be home soon. When I looked up the man was gone.\n\nI jumped up and looked around, to see if I could offer comfort but I didn't see him. Quickly I strode over to his seat to see if maybe he had dropped something that would help me identify him, instead I saw the photograph, lying face down.\n\nI reached out and grabbed the photograph and flipped it over and looked at it and saw the man with his new born son, holding him in his arms and gazing so lovingly.\n\nI took the picture, and put it in my wallet. I got home and kissed my wife and held my daughter tight. Never again would I take them for granted.",
    "MGT": "Harold's weathered hands trembled as he held the faded photograph, its edges worn soft from decades of handling. The autumn breeze rustled through the park's maple trees, sending golden leaves spiraling down around the bench where he sat.\n\nIn the photograph, Margaret smiled back at him, her dark hair caught by the wind on that summer day in 1957. She wore the yellow dress he'd always loved, the one with tiny white daisies along the hem. They'd been at this very park that day, celebrating their first wedding anniversary with a picnic.\n\nA tear rolled down his cheek and dropped onto the protective plastic sleeve covering the precious image. He quickly wiped it away with his handkerchief, just as Margaret would have done. She'd always been so careful with their photographs, organizing them meticulously in albums with neat handwritten captions beneath each one.\n\nToday would have been their sixtieth anniversary. Instead, Harold sat alone, the space beside him on the bench achingly empty. Three years had passed since Margaret's death, but the pain felt as fresh as ever. Some days he could almost convince himself she was just at home, tending to her beloved garden or baking one of her famous apple pies. But then the reality would crash over him again, leaving him gasping for air like a drowning man.\n\nA young couple walked past, hand in hand, lost in their own world of shared smiles and whispered conversations. Harold watched them through tear-blurred eyes, remembering countless walks through this park with Margaret, their fingers intertwined just like that. Even in their seventies, they'd never stopped holding hands.\n\n\"I miss you, Maggie,\" he whispered to the photograph. \"Not a day goes by that I don't think about you.\"\n\nA squirrel scampered up to his feet, probably hoping for a handout. Margaret had always carried nuts in her pocket for the park's wildlife. Harold reached into his coat and pulled out a handful of peanuts, scattering them on the ground. He could almost hear her delighted laugh as the squirrel darted forward to gather its treasure.\n\nCarefully tucking the photograph back into his wallet, Harold stood up slowly. It was time to head home, but he knew he'd be back tomorrow. After all, this had been their special place."

Holy shit. By 3 PM, I'd sworn at least thirty times. The printer jam? Four expletives. That email from corporate? A creative string of cursing that would make a sailor blush. Even my internal monologue was peppered with profanity.\n\nI decided to try cleaning up my language. The next morning, I walked into work determined to keep it PG.

Sarah glanced over, trying not to smile.\n\n\"Sugar!\" I exclaimed when my computer crashed. \"Gosh darn it!\" when I stubbed my toe.\n\nBy lunchtime, I was mentally exhausted from censoring myself. It felt like trying to write with my non-dominant hand - technically possible, but awkward and unnatural.\n\nThat evening, I called my mom to get her take on it. \"Oh honey,\" she laughed, \"you've always been like this. You said your first curse word at age three, right in the middle of church. Nearly gave your grandmother a heart attack.\"\n\nMaybe Sarah was right - I do swear a lot. But you know what? It's just how I express myself. Studies show intelligent people tend to have larger vocabularies, including profanity. I'm not hurting anyone, and I know when to reign it in for professional situations.\n\nBesides, as my dad always says, \"Sometimes 'fuck' is the only word that truly fits the situation.\"\n\nSo here I am, embracing my colorful vocabulary.

The children had suggested she replace the old timepiece with something modern and digital, but she couldn't bear to part with it. Its rhythmic pulse was the thread that stitched her days together, giving structure to the endless hours between sunrise and sunset.\n\nWhen she closed her eyes, each tick carried her backward - to first kisses, baby cries, Sunday dinners, and farewell tears.

With painstaking slowness but total silence, I reached up and removed my rucksack from under my neck, wincing as the kinks in my neck twanged and took up the load of my head. I found the tiny, tough thread of fishing line twisted around my belt loop and drew it taught, then gave it a slow pull. There was a dull clank on the other side of the hatchway as the exterior handle was released. Then I pushed against the metallic wall behind and above me, causing the rolling metal tray to whisper along the rails, and my toes rested lightly on the metal door. I gave the lightest of pushes.\n\nLight poured in around the edges of the hatch as it opened a quarter of an inch. Good, it was dawn. I listened intently for a very long moment, but heard nothing: no slither of flesh, drip of bile, clack of bone, or creak of spoiled larynges. Still moving slowly, I slid the tray farther along the rails, causing the hatch to swing open with a muted creaking. I quickly wound my precious length of fishing line around my fingers, watching the knotted loop at the end skitter along the floor as it scampered around the steel table leg I was using as a pulley in my hatch-release system. Then I turned, lowered my legs, and stood, stamping a little to restore circulation as I swung my rucksack back into place on my shoulder. I took a step, then hesitated and turned, pushing the tray back into the recesses of the morgue refrigerator and carefully shutting the hatch. In these times, if you found a safe hiding place, you saved it, in case you had to come back in a hurry.\n\nAs I set out again, I wondered if it was ironic that a morgue drawer would be a safe haven for the living hiding from the undead.",
    "MGT": "The first thing I noticed was the cold. Not the gentle chill of a winter morning, but a bone-deep, penetrating cold that seemed to freeze my very thoughts. My eyes fluttered open to absolute darkness, and when I tried to move, my shoulders hit solid metal on both sides.\n\nPanic rose in my throat as I realized I was confined in a narrow space. My hands trembled as they explored my surroundings - smooth, cold steel above and below. The air was stale and had a sharp, chemical smell that made my nose burn.\n\nThat's when I remembered the last thing before this darkness: the screech of tires, a blinding light, and then nothing. My heart should have been racing, but it felt eerily slow, as if it was struggling to remember how to beat.\n\nI pushed against the metal above me, and to my surprise, it moved with a mechanical whir. Fluorescent light stabbed my eyes as the drawer slid open. I was in a morgue, lying on a steel tray, wearing nothing but a thin sheet and a toe tag.\n\nThe room was empty, thankfully. Various medical instruments gleamed on nearby tables, and the walls were lined with identical drawers. A clock on the wall read 3:47 AM. The quiet was absolute, broken only by the soft hum of refrigeration units.\n\nI sat up, wrapping the sheet around myself. My skin had a grayish tint, and dark bruises bloomed across my torso. But I was breathing. I was moving. I was, impossibly, alive.\n\nThe door to the morgue creaked open, and a young attendant walked in, his eyes fixed on a clipboard. He took three steps before looking up and seeing me. The clipboard clattered to the floor. His mouth opened and closed like a fish out of water.\n\n\"I can explain,\" I said, though I absolutely could not explain.\n\nHe backed away slowly, then turned and ran, his footsteps echoing down the corridor. I could hear him shouting for security.\n\nI knew I had maybe two minutes before the place would be swarming with staff. Looking down at my toe tag, I saw my own name, time of death listed as 8:23 PM, and cause of death: massive trauma from vehicular impact.\n\nClearly, someone had made a mistake. Or at least, that's what I tried to tell myself as I noticed my reflection in a steel cabinet - and saw my eyes glowing with an unnatural, pale light."

He was chasing bright lights and bigger dreams, leaving their small town and her behind.\n\nNow she's here, searching every face in the crowd, though she's not even sure she'd recognize him anymore. The station announcement crackles through ancient speakers, but she barely hears it over the memories flooding back - summer concerts in the park, late-night drives with the windows down, his voice singing just for her.\n\nA street musician's guitar echoes through the station, and for a moment, she swears it's him playing their song. But it's just another stranger, another ghost of what could have been.\n\nThe train arrives with a screech of metal on metal. As passengers stream onto the platform, she sees a man with silver-streaked hair and a familiar guitar case. Their eyes meet across the crowd, and time seems to stop. For a heartbeat, they're young again, full of dreams and possibilities.\n\nBut he turns away, disappearing into the sea of faces. She lets out a breath she didn't know she was holding and boards her train. Some memories are better left in the past, she decides, as the city lights blur past her window."

Without hesitation, James ran back in. We heard him calling out, \"I'm coming, buddy!\" Then the explosion. They found them later, Tommy safely curled in James's arms, protected from the flames.

She was a sophomore from Georgia, with just a hint of a drawl and a smile that made him wish he could make her laugh forever.\n\n\"I only like Coke,\" she said later that evening, when he asked if she wanted anything to drink. At first he wondered if it was just a Southern thing - they did refer to all soda Coke, after all - but she laughed and assured him that she really did love it. When he brought her the drink, she smiled, and they kissed for hours that night.\n\nThat was two years ago. She would stay over often, and his home became hers as well, her toothbrush a welcome guest at his sink, her woolen sweaters interspersed among his own. He would always make sure to buy Coke for her, even though he personally disliked the beverage. But things changed.\n\nHe would always recall the turning point in their relationship. It was a year and a half in, and things were different between them, although they didn't know it yet. He knew that they had many more fights, but that was normal; honeymoons never lasted forever. She came over after class on a Friday, tired from an exam. They had a small argument the day before - he couldn't recall what about - but it was nothing new, nothing they couldn't recover from.\n\nShe put her bag on the ground. \"Hey, do you have any Coke?\" she called to him, standing in the kitchen. He walked over to the fridge, about to grab some for her, when he realized that somehow, he had forgotten to restock for the first time.\n\n\"No, sorry.

The waitress stood there, pen hovering over her notepad, waiting for my response. But I couldn't speak.\n\nMy mind flashed back to that summer evening twenty years ago. Dad and I were at the old drive-in, watching some forgettable action movie. I'd ordered a Coke, and the carhop had asked those same words. Dad had laughed then, saying, \"Nothing's just 'okay' if you look at it the right way, kiddo.\"\n\nHe'd gone on to spin this elaborate tale about how Pepsi was actually a magical elixir created by ancient soda wizards, and that with every sip, you could taste a different happy memory. I was twelve, old enough to know he was making it up, but young enough to still play along. We spent the rest of the night making up increasingly ridiculous stories about the secret powers of different sodas.\n\nIt was the last movie we ever watched together. The accident happened three days later.\n\nNow, sitting in this generic diner with its sticky vinyl booths and flickering fluorescent lights, those words hit me like a punch to the gut. The waitress shifted uncomfortably, probably wondering why this middle-aged man was staring into space instead of answering a simple question.\n\n\"Sir? Is Pepsi okay?\"\n\nI looked up at her and managed a smile. \"You know what? It's not just okay - it's perfect.\" The words came out a bit shaky, but I meant them.\n\nShe gave me an odd look but wrote it down anyway. As she walked away, I pulled out my phone and called my daughter. She answered on the third ring.\n\n\"Hey sweetie, want to catch a movie tonight? I've got a story to tell you about some ancient soda wizards.\"\n\n\"Dad, I'm fifteen. I'm way too old for stories like that.\"\n\n\"Trust me,\" I said, watching the waitress return with my Pepsi, \"you're never too old for a little magic.\"\n\nI took a sip, and for just a moment, I could have sworn I tasted that summer night from twenty years ago, complete with the sound of my father's laughter carried on the warm evening breeze."

(I do repetitive stuff all the time, and its nearly always someone else to point it out to me...)\n\nOther than those sorts of grammatical/phrasing type things, I think you should work on it. I'd like to know why the fat man is doing what he's doing, what lead up to this moment, what happens after. Also maybe more description of the angels and demons themselves, as I love a fresh take on these sorts of things..: )\n\nthanks for sharing your late night \"doodle\", hope my notes have helped: )",
    "MGT": "The cursor blinked accusingly at me in the darkness of my bedroom, the only light coming from my laptop screen. 3:17 AM. I'd been staring at this document for hours, adding a word here, deleting three there, watching my literary masterpiece deteriorate into digital mush before my eyes.\n\n\"Just write,\" I muttered to myself, fingers hovering over the keyboard. The story was there, somewhere in my sleep-deprived brain, hiding behind caffeine jitters and self-doubt. A tale of dragons? No, too cliché. A romance? God, not at this hour.\n\nMy cat Maurice jumped onto the desk, his orange tail swishing across the screen. He fixed me with that judgmental feline stare that only cats can perfect.\n\n\"What?\" I asked him. \"You think you could do better?\"\n\nMaurice settled himself directly on my keyboard, adding a string of nonsensical letters to my document: kjhgfdsa;lkjhgf\n\n\"Thanks for the input, literary critic.\" I gently moved him aside, but he had a point. The paragraph I'd been agonizing over for the past hour was garbage. Something about moonlight dancing on dewdrops while a mysterious figure lurked in the shadows. Pure amateur hour.\n\nI highlighted the entire section and hit delete. Maurice purred approvingly.\n\n\"Okay, smart guy,\" I said, scratching behind his ears. \"What's your suggestion?\"\n\nHe stretched, yawned, and batted my coffee mug dangerously close to the laptop's edge. Of course - it was so obvious. I'd been trying to write something profound and meaningful when what the story really needed was chaos. A little destruction. Something unexpected.\n\nMy fingers flew across the keyboard as Maurice supervised. The mysterious figure became a clumsy burglar who tripped over a garden gnome. The dewdrops turned into motion-sensor sprinklers. By 4 AM, I had three pages of something that actually made me smile.\n\nSometimes the best literary criticism comes from a cat at 3 AM."

Not in a handsome waxy though, more like a random hairdo every morning unless he finds a way to hold it down.\n\nShort, which can be a sore spot if used against him.\n\nWishes he was stronger, so discovering the dragons and their magic felt like an open road for him.\n\n**Liza/Elizabeth**\n\nThe other main protagonist, girl that gets into everything. Friends with Jay, (gave him the name, in fact), is the one that got them into the mess with the dragons in the first place.\n\nTall, which she literally holds over his head.\n\nShe likes the magic too, but for different reasons, hopes there is a way to bring her cat back, wherever it is now. Kind of a silly worry, but that cat was her only friend for a while.\n\n**Em/EmRald**\n\nGreen dragon, friends with the humans. Is small for a dragon, only about twice as tall as Liza when standing, but can act as emergency transportation.\n\nKind of flighty, wants to discover the Iron Dragon before anyone else.\n\nCan not breathe fire. Yet.\n\n**Gabe/Gabriel/Jinn of the Iron Dragon**\n\nWise and wise-cracking genie on a bottle. He does not grant wishes in an overly magical fashion, but he can make things 'happen.'\n\nTotally insubstantial other than his bottle, he can take any look he wants and acts as both the jokester and the intellectual.",

I close my eyes and listen.\n\nFirst comes Eliza, materializing like morning mist. Forty-two, a botanist who speaks more fluently to plants than people. Her fingers are permanently stained green, nails trimmed practical-short. She collects vintage seed catalogs and keeps her mother's ashes in a terrarium where rare orchids bloom. She hasn't cried since her divorce three years ago.\n\nThen Marcus appears, twenty-seven, always wearing his grandfather's worn leather jacket despite the Miami heat. A chef who lost his sense of taste in an accident, now cooking entirely by memory and instinct. He has a constellation of burn scars on his left forearm and laughs too loudly when nervous. He sends money home to Haiti monthly but hasn't visited in nine years.\n\nBetween them materializes Dani, sixteen, with hair dyed a different color every two weeks. Currently electric blue. They're building a radio telescope in their bedroom closet, convinced they've detected signals nobody else has noticed. Their school counselor calls it escapism; Dani calls it science. They've never met their biological father but have created elaborate stories about him being everything from a spy to an alien.\n\nThese three strangers will collide when a rare night-blooming plant releases spores that temporarily allow people to access forgotten memories—their own and others'. In the aftermath, they'll form an unlikely alliance.\n\nI begin typing their first meeting: Eliza's greenhouse, Marcus seeking unusual ingredients, Dani breaking in to \"borrow\" equipment. The plant unfurling in moonlight.\n\nMy characters breathe now. They whisper their secrets, their fears, their hopes. The page is no longer blank. The story has begun."

Towers reached impossibly high, their windows dark and empty. Streets paved with strange black stone wound between the buildings like sleeping serpents. Nature had begun to reclaim these ghost cities; vines crawled up walls, and trees burst through cobblestones.\n\nIn what they would later learn was Paris, they found countless skeletal remains. Bodies lay where they fell – in homes, streets, and great halls adorned with faded paintings. The explorers wore their sacred masks, fearing the lingering spirits of death might still lurk in the air.\n\nIn libraries, they discovered books written in unknown scripts. In museums, they found artifacts that told stories of a civilization that had reached for the stars. The Azteca scholars would spend generations decoding these mysteries.\n\nMost haunting were the preserved faces in paintings and photographs – pale-skinned people wearing strange garments, frozen in time, their eyes seeming to watch the explorers from across the centuries. These ghosts of the old world had built wonders, yet something had struck them down at the height of their power.\n\nAs Captain Tlaloc stood in the ruins of Westminster Abbey, he whispered a prayer to his gods, wondering if his people would ever unlock the secrets of this dead civilization."

I imagine a mother feels the same way.\n\nWhen she first did it, I was in shock. But not the way one might think; I was just having the greatest orgasm ever and my whole body froze and strained itself. She clearly took advantage there, but now it really seems that was probably the best way to do it.\n\nLike a mosquito, when sucking blood she would simultaneously ingress small amounts of toxins into my bloodstream. A mix of exotic chemicals that made sure the wounds didn't infect, healed properly and extremely quickly (about an hour or two), and made the bitee experience a feeling of inner peace and euforia, in moderate amounts.\n\nI had always had a mild form of odaxelagnia, like many men do. I always would come the hardest when she would bite my lip or nipple a bit while I worked her pussy.\n\nAnyway, you can think about it what you like, but I'm not giving it up.

She froze, eyes wide with panic.\n\n\"I can explain,\" she whispered.\n\nI simply nodded and patted the bed beside me. \"I know what you are.\"\n\nThat was three months ago. Now, dating a vampire is surprisingly mundane. Eliza still works her night shift at the hospital (blood bank access is convenient, she admits), and I've adjusted my schedule to spend more evenings with her.\n\n\"Does it bother you?\" she asked one night as we cuddled on the couch watching horror movies.

Everyone has baggage.\"\n\nShe playfully bit my shoulder—with normal teeth. \"I'm serious.\"\n\n\"So am I. You're still you. Just with dietary restrictions and a sunlight allergy.\"\n\nThere are perks to dating a vampire. Eliza has fascinating stories from her 127 years. She's incredibly strong—helping me move apartments was a breeze. And she's fiercely protective, which came in handy when my ex showed up uninvited.\n\nWe have our challenges. Family dinners are tricky—she's mastered the art of pushing food around her plate. Weekend activities require careful planning around sunlight hours.

Sirta was fed (the village were not savages, they used to just starve these people, but these days, they even allowed them to survive) and learned to scavage, she was not spoken to, but she learned speech from hearing the others. When she spoke to them, they told each other how horribly inappropriate she had just been.\n\nShe tried to be useful to the village by waking them when the jackals were about to attack at night, and it even led to a bit of appreciation, until once, she confused a group of housecats with jackals.

Every evening I'd come home and paint until midnight, trying to keep my dreams alive while my marriage crumbled under the weight of my divided attention.\n\nNow, at forty-five, I've finally taken the leap. Sold the house, moved into this tiny studio apartment, left the security of my corporate job behind. Some call it a mid-life crisis. I call it my last chance at living authentically.\n\nThe brush feels both foreign and familiar in my hand as I make the first stroke. Red paint bleeds across the canvas, imperfect but bold.

Of the years spent believing I wasn't a \"real\" artist because I couldn't commit fully to the craft.\n\nAnother stroke, then another. The image begins to emerge - a phoenix rising from ashes, its wings caught between dissolution and reformation. Like me, trapped between who I was and who I'm becoming. My hand moves more confidently now, muscle memory taking over as I lose myself in the process.\n\nI don't know if I'll succeed. The savings won't last forever, and the art world is brutally competitive. But for the first time in decades, I'm not painting in stolen moments between obligations. I'm not apologizing for my passion or treating it like a guilty pleasure.\n\nI'm finally giving myself permission to fail spectacularly at the only thing I've ever truly wanted to do."
