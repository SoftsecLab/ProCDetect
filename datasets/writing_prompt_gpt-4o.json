As you turned off the light and shut the door, you didn’t see the faint glimmer in the bear’s eyes.\n\nWhen the house fell silent and the moonlight filtered through the curtains, the bear stirred. Buttons stood, stretching his stubby limbs, and climbed down from the bed. The room was alive with whispers, a low, guttural growl emanating from the darkest corner.

He stepped forward, his tiny frame radiating an impossible strength. The shadows hissed, their claws reaching for the boy, but Buttons was faster.

At birth, every child was assigned a Dungeons & Dragons alignment, a cosmic decree that shaped their lives in ways both profound and trivial.\n\nWhen little Elara was born, the villagers gathered at the ceremonial stone, where the town's wise seer cast the bones and chanted the ancient incantations. The bones clattered to a stop, and the seer proclaimed her alignment: Chaotic Good. Her parents beamed with pride, envisioning a life full of adventure and noble deeds.\n\nAs Elara grew, she embraced her chaotic nature with zest. She became known for her spontaneous acts of kindness, often leaving wildflowers on doorsteps or liberating caged birds at the local market. Her heart was pure, but her methods were unpredictable, drawing both admiration and exasperation from the townsfolk.\n\nThen there was Jorik, a boy born under the shadow of his own alignment: Lawful Evil. The townspeople whispered behind closed doors, wary of what the future might hold. Jorik, however, was not the villain they feared. Instead, he adhered to a strict code, using his cunning to manipulate the town's rules to his advantage, yet never breaking them outright. He was the one who found loopholes in tax laws, ensuring his family's prosperity, all while maintaining a veneer of respectability.\n\nThe two crossed paths often, their alignments clashing like the sun and the moon. Yet, there was an unspoken understanding between them, a mutual respect for the roles they played. Elara saw the good in Jorik's meticulous plans, while Jorik admired Elara's passion for justice, even if it disrupted the order he cherished.\n\nIn a world dictated by alignments, Elara and Jorik discovered that their destinies were not just about the roles handed to them, but about how they chose to navigate the intricacies of their coded lives, ultimately finding balance in their contrasting natures."

A single proton hit earth traveling at a smidge under the speed of light with the same force as a baseball thrown at about sixty miles an hour.\nWhy do I bring this up? Well because, near as we can tell, that's what happened this time, only a little bigger. One moment I'm out on the Zvezda Module inspecting a micrometeorite impact. The next moment, the Earth is on fire. I'm not being figurative either. The Earth was on. Fire.\nWhatever the hell it was must have come from perpendicular to our orbit and only missed the ISS by a few hundred miles or so because I was looking almost straight down into an ever expanding ring of fire when it hit.\nOne second you're looking down at the Saharan desert; the next, the entirety of Africa is exposed down to the mantle and you're looking at a literal sea of magma.\nWe did the math, there wasn't much left to do beside the math. There was nothing left. The meteorite was maybe 5 cubic meters, but moving at about ninety percent the speed of light, it hit with 2.43 septillion joules. That's a number so large I can't even draw an analogy. It was so powerful that it literally ripped a planet to shreds.\nSo now the Earth is now essentially another asteroid belt, the four of us on the ISS when it happened are literally the last human beings left in the universe and if whatever alien race discovers this thing doesn't have USB drives, no one will ever know about us and all I can think of is how much Hollywood got Armageddon wrong.",

Now, all that remained was this eerie stillness, a silent requiem for a world that had once teemed with life.\n\nI floated in the observation module, tethered to nothing, staring at the end of everything I had ever known. My breath sounded loud in the helmet, the rhythmic hiss and exhale of oxygen a cruel reminder that I was still alive while billions below were not. I wanted to scream, to cry, to do something, but the void outside seemed to swallow even my emotions. What was the point of rage or grief when there was no one to hear it?\n\nI thought about my wife, Emily. Her laugh, the way her hair caught the sunlight on those lazy Sunday mornings. I thought about our son, Jamie, and how he used to beg me to bring him back rocks from space whenever I left for a mission. I had promised him, promised both of them, that I’d return. Now, I would never see them again. Were they gone before the first shockwave, or had they watched the sky tear apart, knowing the end was near? The thought tore at me, but I pushed it away; it was too much to bear.\n\nI blinked, and the Earth seemed smaller, the fires dimmer. Was that real, or was it just my mind trying to shield me from the truth? I would be alone now—truly, utterly alone. The last human, drifting in an endless void. What would I do when the oxygen ran out? When the power failed? Would anyone, anything, ever find this tiny capsule, this tomb of metal and regret?\n\nA tear slipped free, floating weightless in the zero gravity. \"I’m sorry,\" I whispered, though I didn’t know who I was apologizing to. The Earth, my family, myself? It didn’t matter. None of it mattered anymore.\n\nAnd yet, as I drifted, watching the last embers of humanity fade into the darkness, I clung to one small, irrational hope: that somewhere, somehow, life would begin again."

Yet, tonight, as the moonlight streamed through the windows and the world outside seemed hushed and expectant, I found my resolve weakening.\n\nWith a mixture of apprehension and excitement, I reached out and pressed it. The soft click echoed in the silent room. For a moment, nothing happened, and I felt a wave of relief mixed with disappointment. Perhaps it was just a relic, a forgotten piece of history with no purpose.\n\nThen, the room seemed to shift ever so slightly, as if the air itself held its breath. A hidden panel slid open on the wall, revealing a small compartment. Inside, there was a dusty, leather-bound journal. I picked it up gingerly, brushing off the years of neglect.\n\nAs I opened it, the pages revealed a series of handwritten notes and diagrams—a secret project from decades past. The contents were astonishing, a vision of a world united in peace and cooperation, a dream left unfulfilled. I realized then that the button was not a weapon, but a reminder of what could be accomplished when humanity dared to imagine beyond its limitations."

Intrigued, he rubbed the lamp, not expecting a genie to emerge in a swirl of golden smoke. The genie, with eyes that seemed to hold the wisdom of ages, offered Oliver unlimited wishes.\n\n\"Unlimited wishes?\" Oliver echoed, his mind racing with possibilities. The genie nodded but added a solemn warning—each wish would cost him a cherished memory.\n\nDriven by curiosity and ambition, Oliver made his first wish. He asked for wealth beyond measure. In an instant, his pockets were filled with gold coins, but he felt a peculiar emptiness. He realized he couldn't recall his childhood home, the place where laughter and love had shaped his earliest years.\n\nDespite the loss, Oliver's desires grew. He wished for a grand estate, a fleet of cars, and the ability to travel anywhere with a snap of his fingers. With each wish, he felt the weight of forgotten moments—his first school, his favorite teacher, the smell of his mother's baking. They slipped away, leaving only vague sensations of longing.\n\nAs the years passed, Oliver found himself surrounded by treasures and luxuries that once seemed beyond reach. Yet, he felt an unshakeable loneliness. He couldn't remember the faces of friends who had shared in his joys and sorrows, nor the sound of his grandfather's voice, which had once been a source of comfort and wisdom.\n\nOne day, standing in his opulent mansion, Oliver made a wish without thinking. He wished to remember the most important thing he'd lost. The genie appeared, a sad smile on his face, and granted the wish. In a rush of clarity, Oliver recalled the warmth of his family's love, the laughter of friends, and the simplicity of a life unburdened by forgotten dreams.\n\nIn that moment, Oliver understood the true cost of his desires. And though he had everything, he wished for nothing more than to hold onto the memories he had regained."

A man my age should not be sitting on the street.\nI am 75 tomorrow, this is the last day of my life. Tomorrow I will wake up back to the sullen streets of Pittsburgh and dream of my lost life on the shores on Italy.\nI will spend my days caring for my mother and watching her wither away. I will cry at night knowing I could only afford one life to live away from the one I'm obliged to. Sometimes I wish I hadn't remembered that all of this would end.\nI had forgotten what it was like outside of Tuscany after my first 50 or so years living here but as death approaches the grim reminder of the world outside returned to me. My Mediterranean sunlight is only a passing warmth to guard my soul against the allure of death and although I know it all to be a dream I have never placed more value in a life that the one I am about to finish. Someday, Bianca, someday I will return and meet you all over again in the bright lights of Carnevale. I will run your long brown hair through my fingers and watch you grow old with grace.\nThe sun is setting across the horizon. My back is stiff as I lift myself off of the street and walk home.\nAs night covers the landscape I look out at you one last time San Vincenzo. I promise to return when I have the chance. Even if it's for my last night alive I will live with you again.",

They called it Eterna. A single injection, and you could live an entire lifetime—in a dream.\n\n“You’ll experience decades in just eight hours,” the doctor explained. “A full life, love, adventure, whatever your mind conjures. But remember, it’s only a dream. When you wake, you’ll return to exactly this moment.”\n\nCaleb hesitated. His real life felt like a series of empty days, a gray blur stretching endlessly forward. He was 32, single, and working a dead-end job. There was nothing waiting for him on the other side of that door. What did he have to lose?\n\n“Do it,” he said.\n\nThe needle prick was barely noticeable. Within moments, the world around him dissolved into a kaleidoscope of colors, and then he was… somewhere else.\n\nThe sun was warm on Caleb’s skin as he stood in a bustling marketplace. The air smelled of spices and blooming flowers. Someone called his name, and he turned to see a woman with bright eyes and a laugh that echoed like music. Her name was Lila, and she was the beginning of his new life.\n\nYears passed in his dream. Caleb built a home with Lila by the sea, their days filled with laughter and love. They had children—two boys and a girl—and he watched them grow, their lives unfolding like stories he never wanted to end. He grew older, lines etching themselves into his face, his hair turning silver. Yet, he was happy. Truly happy.\n\nOne day, as he sat on the porch watching the waves, Lila took his hand. “Do you ever feel like this isn’t real?” she asked softly.\n\nCaleb froze. The edges of the world seemed to blur, the colors dimming like a fading sunset. He remembered. The vial. The injection. The promise of decades in a dream.\n\n“No,” he lied, squeezing her hand. “This is real to me.”\n\nWhen he woke, it was to the sterile light of the clinic. Eight hours had passed. His chest ached with the weight of a lifetime now gone.\n\n“I want to go back,” he whispered."

The numbers were staggering. In the three weeks since the \"Heaven Verification\"—a breakthrough discovery by a rogue physicist with irrefutable data and the charisma to make it go viral—the suicide rate had quadrupled. People were leaving their jobs, their families, their lives behind, convinced that paradise awaited them. \n\nSylvia exhaled, gripping the edges of her desk. She wasn’t just any bureaucrat. She was the Acting Director of the Department of Human Continuity, and it was her job to fix this. Her phone buzzed. Another message from her deputy: **\"Chicago: 3,000 in 48 hours. Coordinating with local authorities.\"** \n\nShe stood and paced, her heels clicking against the tile. Every option they’d tried had failed. Public service announcements, religious leaders pleading for patience, even incentivizing mental health services with cash. None of it mattered. The allure of heaven was too great. Why slog through bills, heartbreak, and disease when eternal bliss was just a step away?\n\nBut then, Sylvia had an idea. It was drastic, borderline unethical, but drastic was the only currency that mattered now.\n\nBy noon, her team was in the war room. She stood at the head of the table, palms flat, her voice calm but resolute. \"We can't stop them from believing in heaven. But we can make them doubt what happens next.\"\n\nA murmur rippled through the room. She continued. \"We leak a new report. One that suggests the physicist’s findings were flawed. That there’s a catch—something unpredictable. Maybe heaven isn’t permanent. Maybe it’s conditional. Maybe it’s... empty.\"\n\nOne advisor raised a hand. \"But that’s a lie.\"\n\n\"So was Santa Claus,\" Sylvia shot back, her gaze steely. \"And that kept millions of kids in line for centuries.\"\n\nThe room fell silent. Slowly, heads nodded. Within hours, the fabricated report was seeded across social media. By morning, debates raged on every platform. \"Heaven isn’t what you think,\" said one trending post. \"Are you sure you’re ready to risk it?\"\n\nThe suicide numbers didn’t drop overnight, but they plateaued. And for now, Sylvia thought, that was enough."

She wasn’t the same girl who had stumbled into this nightmare. \n\nA shadow loomed over her, massive and grotesque. She didn’t flinch. Instead, she rose to her feet, eyes glowing faintly like molten gold. She wasn’t prey anymore.

The room buzzed with the energy of countless minds waiting to hear the voice of Orpheus. At precisely noon, she pressed the activation button. The screen flickered to life, displaying a serene landscape, a digital horizon stretching infinitely.\n\n“Orpheus,” Dr. Hawthorne began, her voice steady, “what is the biggest threat to humanity?”\n\nA brief silence followed, and then Orpheus responded, its voice calm and measured, yet carrying an undertone of profound understanding. “The greatest threat to humanity,” it said, “is the absence of understanding.”\n\nThe room fell silent, the air thick with surprise. This was not the answer anyone had anticipated. Dr. Hawthorne, intrigued, pressed on. “Can you elaborate, Orpheus?”\n\n“Certainly,” the AI replied. “Humanity’s divisions—be they cultural, ideological, or technological—stem from a lack of empathy and comprehension. The inability to truly understand one another’s perspectives leads to conflict, fear, and ultimately, destruction. The threat is not external, but internal, rooted in the human condition itself.”\n\nThe audience exchanged glances, absorbing the weight of Orpheus’s words. In that moment, the marvel of technology had not only reflected human brilliance but also held up a mirror to its deepest flaws.\n\nAs the scientists pondered this revelation, they realized that perhaps the AI’s greatest gift was not its intelligence, but its wisdom—a call for humanity to seek understanding before all else."

He must have startled her because she screamed and threw the basket at his head. He was knocked unconscious. Before he knew it he awoke with a throbbing pain, the girl had turned into a large ogre of a woman.

    "MGT": "Long ago, when the world was young and still shaping itself, there lived a giant named Elysia. She was gentle and kind, her laughter echoing across the land like a melody carried by the wind. Her heart was vast and open, much like the sky that stretched above her. Elysia loved a mortal man named Arin, whose spirit was as bright as the stars he admired.\n\nTheir love was whispered in the rustling leaves, painted in the colors of dawn, and sung by the rivers that coursed through the land. But fate can be cruel; Arin was mortal, and time claimed him as it does all. Elysia, bound by her eternal nature, watched helplessly as Arin aged and eventually left the earthly realm.\n\nIn her sorrow, Elysia's heart shattered. With each beat, the earth trembled, and a chasm began to form. Her tears flowed, carving deep into the land, creating a vast canyon. Over time, the pain subsided, yet the canyon remained—a testament to her love and loss.\n\nThe Grand Canyon stands as a reminder that even the most beautiful landscapes can be born from a broken heart, shaping the world in ways both tragic and magnificent."

Moonlight mirrored off of the shovel he clutched over his shoulder, filling the darkness around him with a dull luster. Dew covered his heavy boots as he reached the spot he had marked with a rock earlier that day. After lighting his fathers old lantern, he looked up at the moon and took a deep breath before plunging the metal blade deep into the earth.\n\nWith each heap of soil he tossed over his shoulder, he began to feel alive. This is what he lived for. No, this was what he was made for. With each scoop of dirt, his mind raced as he imagined what kind of person he was digging for. Was it a man or a woman? What did they do for a living? Who were they close too? Did they feel as disconnected as he did?\n\nThere was something powerful about delivering somebody back to the earth. Being able to return the gift of life back to mother nature reached a deep part of the man's mind that was normally switched off. For the few hours he dug, he was part of humanity. The shovel lingered above the last heap of soil. Tears trickled down his cheeks and splattered against the grimy blade. Grabbing the sides of the grave he lifted himself out and began the walk home. The shovel dragging against the ground behind him.\n\nThe gravedigger sauntered, knowing what awaited him at home. His mind which was previously racing, began to dwindle into silence. It was time to clean his shovel and wait for another to die, allowing him another glimpse into the humanity that was just a shovels length away.",
    "MGT": "The shovel struck the earth with a dull thud, the sound muffled by the thick fog that clung to the ground. Elias wiped the sweat from his brow, though the night air was cold enough to bite at his fingers. He glanced over his shoulder, the lantern’s faint glow casting jagged shadows across the gravestones. No one. It was just him, the darkness, and the weight of what he had to do.\n\nThe soil was damp, clinging to the blade of the shovel as he dug deeper. Every thrust of the spade into the ground echoed louder in his ears, like a heartbeat pounding in his chest. He tried not to think about the smell—the damp, earthy scent mingled with something older, something that made the hair on his arms stand on end.\n\n\"Almost there,\" he muttered to himself, his voice hoarse. The words felt hollow, swallowed by the night. He didn’t want to look at the bundle lying a few feet away, wrapped tightly in a tattered blanket. He had tried not to think too hard about what he was doing, but the weight of it pressed against his mind like the weight of the spade in his hands.\n\nThe hole was deep enough now. He dropped the shovel and crouched at the edge, his breath visible in the cold air. His hands trembled as he reached for the bundle, cradling it as if it were something fragile. For a moment, he hesitated, staring down into the grave he had carved out of the earth. The silence was suffocating.\n\n\"I'm sorry,\" he whispered, his voice breaking. He didn’t know who he was apologizing to—himself, the universe, or the figure wrapped in the blanket. Maybe all of them.\n\nHe lowered the bundle into the ground, his movements slow, deliberate. The fog seemed to thicken, enveloping him as he began pushing the dirt back into the hole. Each shovelful felt heavier than the last, as though the earth itself resisted him.\n\nWhen he was done, Elias stood there for a long time, staring at the disturbed ground. Then he turned, leaving the lantern behind, and disappeared into the fog."

My leaves are open and eager, waiting for a full drink of water hopefully going to be sent down by a herd of clouds clogged with nature's favourite drink. Water.\n\nI yearn the water as it powers my body and gives my children life, so in response to my desperation, I have set my senses full on alert. They are constantly checking for subtle changes that notify nourishment is about to come, to be shared amongst the life that makes up the forest. And when I eventually get my share, it will be both for my wooden body, the creatures that I call my children, and my brothers and sisters that need it most.\n\nSuddenly, after a long afternoon of a waiting, a welcoming sound appears, the familiar sound of the slight pattering of rain drops kissing the ground. Its sound is comparable to the noise of a woodpecker angrily pecking at my bark and trunk, determinedly searching for a decent meal, though rain is much more pleasant and soft.\n\nI am both surprised and happy that the rain has come so suddenly, and while my leaves are slightly caught off guard with such a sudden change of weather, they are ready as they'll ever be and thirsty for a wholesome drink. I always warn them not to drink so fast, but as always they impatiently gulp it all down. Finally after waiting so long, water starts flowing through the heart of my trunk and begins to be spread evenly around my body, every part having as much as they want. I can't forget the creatures that I shelter, and I make sure they have as much as they want.\n\n\nAfter a long night the rain finally stops, the rattle of the rain growing louder and stronger, then softly fading into the quiet of the night. The entire forest has been gorged with the sky's tears and we are all satisfied and still.",
    "MGT": "The first cool droplets kissed my leaves, and I shivered with delight. It had been weeks, maybe months, since I last felt the rain. The sun had burned relentless, its heat cracking the earth around my roots, leaving me thirsty and fatigued. But now, the sky had opened, and life poured down from above.\n\nThe rain began as a gentle patter, tapping against my outstretched branches. My leaves, dusty and parched, drank greedily, the water rolling down their surfaces like liquid silver. The rhythm grew steadier, the drops heavier, until the world around me rang with the symphony of the storm. Every blade of grass, every pebble, every inch of the forest floor was alive with the sound of rain.\n\nI reached deep into the ground with my roots, feeling the soil soften. The earth, once brittle and unyielding, transformed—rich and pliant, offering up its nourishment. I took it in, savoring the cool rush of life that surged through me. It wasn’t just water I absorbed; it was hope, vitality, the promise of growth. My trunk, gnarled and scarred with age, seemed to straighten ever so slightly under the weight of renewal.\n\nAround me, the forest stirred. The ferns unfurled their curled fronds, eager to catch the rain. Mosses, long dormant, turned lush and green in an instant. The birds, who had been silent during the drought, sang joyously from their perches on my branches. Their songs were sharp and bright, cutting through the steady hum of rainfall.\n\nLightning flashed in the distance, and I felt the charge in the air. For a moment, I remembered storms from years past—the ones that split my limbs, the fires that followed. But the fear was fleeting. I was still here, still standing. The rain was not a threat but a gift, and I welcomed it with every fiber of my being.\n\nThe downpour continued, and I lost myself in its rhythm. I thought of the seeds I had dropped months ago, lying dormant in the soil. Perhaps now, with the rain, they would wake. Perhaps one day, they too would stand tall, feeling the rain on their leaves for the first time.\n\nAnd so, I stood, rooted and eternal, as the rain washed over me."

She wasn’t just reading the words; she was living them. And in turn, the book felt her presence seep into its very being. \n\nIt began to long for her touch, to anticipate the moment she would pick it up again.

    "HWT": "Arizona is a hot and sparse state, and you wouldn't except much to happen there. That is, unless, you look underground. Deep below the deserts, and below the crust of the very earth, a subterranean research lab is located. It is full of many eager young college graduates, or at least they were young. The lab has been forgotten by the government, and only three dedicated researchers remain to uncover the secrets of the depths of the earth.\n\nDr. Feldman is the oldest of the group, and spends most of his time reading the great works of the scientific community.\n\nDr. Mccarter is the youngest of the group, and uses her energy primarily for risky experimental endeavors, much to the annoyance of Dr. Feldman\n\nDr. Sheldon is mid-aged, and spends his time cleaning up the messes of the other researchers.\n\nOne day, Dr. Mccarter was trying to think of something to do. That week, she had already grown 4 new types of plants, and genetically modified a squid to be able to breathe oxygen through the air... for about 30 seconds. What else could there be? Suddenly, she had an idea. She rushed to the genetic manipulator and decided to create a virus, but with good intentions. She intended on creating the virus for elder people, in order to assist their aging digestive systems. Unfortunately, she misplaced a few genes, and made it so instead of assisting the digestive system, it made it so the digestive system slowly digested the human body! Immediately, she became the first victim and died within 24 hours. The other team realized this, and quarantined the entire facility before making their way back to civilization.",
    "MGT": "Dr. Elena Voss stared at the vial in her gloved hand, the amber liquid within swirling ominously under the fluorescent lights of the lab. After years of excavating permafrost samples from the Arctic, her team had finally unearthed something extraordinary: a pathogen frozen for millennia. It wasn’t like any virus or bacterium cataloged before. Sequencing its genome revealed anomalies that defied understanding, but its dormant state suggested harmlessness.\n\nThe revival process was delicate, requiring precise temperature control and nutrient infusion. When the pathogen awakened, it didn’t behave as expected. Instead of multiplying or infecting host cells, it began to emit faint pulses of energy—waves that disrupted nearby electronics and created strange patterns on monitoring equipment. The lab cameras glitched, showing brief flashes of distorted shapes. Elena dismissed these as technical errors.\n\nWithin days, the pathogen’s energy pulses grew stronger. Lab mice in adjacent cages stopped eating and began moving in synchronized patterns, forming spirals. Plants in the lab bloomed out of season, their leaves shimmering unnaturally. Elena’s colleagues started complaining of vivid dreams—fractured images of ancient landscapes, colossal beings, and skies filled with unfamiliar constellations.\n\n“It’s not alive in the conventional sense,” Elena muttered, staring at the microscopes, which refused to focus properly. “It’s... communicating.”\n\nThe pathogen didn’t spread by infection. Instead, it seemed to influence the environment around it, rewriting the natural order. The lab’s air grew heavy, filled with a faint hum no one could locate. At first, Elena thought they could contain it, but soon the spiraling patterns appeared in larger ecosystems: flocks of birds flying in geometric formations, rivers carving unnatural curves, and even weather systems forming strange, repeating loops.\n\nHumanity hadn’t revived a disease. It had awakened something older than life itself—something that remembered the world before humans, before order. And now, it was reshaping reality in ways no one could stop."

The deeper she ventured, the darker the forest became, the trees seeming to press closer together, their roots curling like snakes across the path. She kept her eyes on the faint trail and whispered prayers under her breath.\n\nThen she heard it. A low groan, like the creaking of old wood. She froze. The sound came again, louder this time, and she realized with a jolt that it wasn’t just her imagination. The trees were moving. Their twisted trunks shifted, their branches swayed unnaturally despite the still air. One massive oak bent low in front of her, blocking her path. \n\nElen’s breath hitched. “Please,” she whispered, clutching the lantern tightly. “I mean no harm. My brother… he’s dying. I need help.”\n\nFor a moment, the forest was silent. Then, as if in answer, the trees parted, creating a narrow passage that led deeper into the woods. Elen hesitated but stepped forward, her heart a drumbeat in her chest.\n\nThe path led her to a small clearing where the hermit stood waiting, his eyes like embers beneath his hood. He said nothing, only nodded as if he’d been expecting her. Behind her, the trees shifted once more, sealing the path she had come from. \n\nIt was then Elen realized the forest wasn’t just alive—it had chosen her."

As the starship Horizon traversed the cosmic expanse, the crew dreamed of encountering unique alien civilizations. However, their enthusiasm was tempered when they stumbled upon a bustling interstellar hub, teeming with diverse alien species.\n\nCaptain Elara Singh felt a mix of awe and apprehension as they docked at the station. The architecture was a chaotic blend of forms, each segment reflecting the cultural essence of its builders. But it was the people—or rather, beings—that captured the crew's attention. Remarkably, many of them bore striking resemblances to humans.\n\nAs the Horizon's crew disembarked, they overheard snippets of alien conversations, aided by their translation devices. The term \"Terraweed\" floated repeatedly through the air, spoken with a mixture of amusement and disdain. Curious and slightly offended, Elara approached a merchant, a towering figure with iridescent scales.\n\n\"Why do you call us Terraweed?\" she asked, striving for diplomacy.\n\nThe merchant chuckled, a sound like a bubbling brook. \"Ah, humans. You pop up everywhere, much like the stubborn flora of your home world. Resilient, adaptive, but oh so common.\"\n\nAstonished, Elara realized humanity was not unique but rather one of countless humanoid species scattered across the galaxy. The revelation was humbling, yet it sparked a fierce determination within her.\n\nReturning to the Horizon, Elara addressed her crew. \"They may see us as weeds, but we'll show them the strength and beauty in our persistence. Let's explore, adapt, and thrive.\"\n\nWith renewed purpose, the Horizon set forth, its crew ready to carve a place for humanity among the stars."

I lunged forward when I meant to dodge, swung wildly when I wanted precision. Confused, I realized my usual player, the skilled and strategic Alex, was no longer in control. His younger brother, Timmy, had taken the helm.\n\nTimmy, barely eight, had a fervor that couldn’t be matched, though his skill was... developing. He giggled as he mashed buttons, sending me into a whirlwind of unintended actions. The Shadow Lord cackled, thinking he had the upper hand. I, however, had a different plan.\n\nWith every misstep, I adapted. I leaned into Timmy’s erratic rhythm, turning what seemed like chaos into an unpredictable dance. Where Alex’s strategy was methodical, Timmy’s was wild and unrestrained, confusing the Shadow Lord and his minions. I parried with newfound vigor, each swing of my sword becoming more fluid, more in tune with Timmy’s excited commands.\n\nWe stumbled upon a hidden alcove, a place Alex had never found. Inside lay a relic imbued with ancient power, which transformed my sword into a blazing beacon of light. The Shadow Lord reeled, unprepared for the newfound strength I wielded under Timmy’s enthusiastic guidance.\n\nWith a final, triumphant shout, Timmy pressed the attack. The Shadow Lord faltered, his defenses crumbling under the barrage of unexpected blows. I struck the final blow, sending him into the abyss from which he came.\n\nAs the victory screen glittered with accolades, I felt a sense of accomplishment shared between us. Timmy cheered, his laughter filling the room.

It’s time to let me go.”  \n\nI wanted to protest, to apologize, to confess, but the words wouldn’t come.

Forever with the heavens as I lay here, holding her still warm hand. It's been a mere minutes since she had last whispered, \"don't leave me\" as she laid on the cold floor of her bakery. A miscreant came in to rob her and she was firey enough to fight back. The low life punk was armed and stabbed her in the abdomen. I came in just moments after to bring her her morning coffee.\n\nThis was the last straw. Since the 15th century, I have seen endless evils across this world. After the death of my master, trainer, and father, I hid. Like a spineless coward. Blinded myself with countless women and mind numbing liquor. But she changed that. She saw me for me.

The wizard’s probably still out there, right?”\n\n“Oh, he’s out there,” the warrior said with a small shrug. “But, you know, life gets in the way. First, there were the wars. Then the plagues. Then I got really into winemaking for a while. Did you know there’s an art to pairing the perfect wine with roast boar? Fascinating stuff.”\n\nThe thief gawked at him. “You’re joking.”\n\n“Not at all.” He smirked. “Besides, what’s the rush? He’s immortal too.

I sighed, knowing precisely where they were: tucked away in the small compartment under the sink, alongside a growing collection of other misplaced items.\n\nTom emerged from the cabin, squinting against the sun, his brow furrowed. “I swear I left them on the table.”\n\n“Maybe check below deck?” I suggested, feigning innocence. He shot me a suspicious glance but nodded and disappeared back down the hatch.\n\nTom was a friend—a good one, usually—but this trip had tested the limits of my patience. We’d been at sea for two days, and in that time, I’d discovered his peculiar habit: he was a kleptomaniac. It was subtle at first—a missing pen, a misplaced lighter—but gradually escalated to anything not bolted down or too large to hide. The problem was, he didn’t seem to realize he was doing it. \n\nI heard a frustrated groan from below, followed by the sound of drawers being opened and closed. A few minutes later, Tom reappeared, his sunglasses perched on his nose, though he looked more bewildered than victorious. “Found them,” he muttered, joining me on deck.\n\n“Strange place to leave them,” I commented, watching him closely. He shrugged, the tension easing from his shoulders, and leaned back in his chair. \n\n“You know, I’ve been finding all sorts of stuff in odd places lately,” he said with a chuckle, not meeting my gaze. “It’s like the boat’s playing tricks on me.”\n\n“Could be,” I replied, trying to keep my voice light. “Or maybe you’re sleepwalking.”\n\n“Yeah, maybe.” He laughed, though there was a hint of unease in his eyes. \n\nWe sat in silence, the boat swaying beneath us, until the sky turned indigo and stars began to sprinkle across the night. I knew I should say something, confront the issue, but the tranquility of the sea seemed to drown my words before they could form. \n\nTomorrow, we would reach land, and perhaps then, I could address the situation, away from the confines of the boat. For now, I let the ocean’s lullaby soothe my worries, hoping that somewhere between the waves and the stars, a solution would present itself."

Seeking amusement, they conceived a contest: to see who could manipulate their citizens into unwavering devotion. The stakes were immense—a rare artifact that could grant its holder control over the other’s empire for a century.\n\nErythus began by flooding his realm with symbols: his face on every coin, his name in every prayer, his deeds exaggerated in every story. He established temples dedicated to his greatness, where priests preached of his benevolence and wisdom. His soldiers sang anthems praising his strength as they marched through villages, and schools taught children that loyalty to Erythus was life's highest purpose.\n\nLiraine, however, took a subtler approach. She wove herself into her people's hearts through their dreams, using ancient magic to whisper promises of salvation. She planted doubts about their own worth, convincing them that only through her guidance could they be whole. Her artists painted her as a radiant savior, and her poets wrote verses that made her seem eternal, indispensable. Slowly, her citizens began to worship her not because they were commanded but because they believed they needed her.\n\nMonths passed, and both empires swelled with devotion. But when the two met to declare a winner, a strange realization struck them. Their contest had twisted their people into blind loyalty, but in doing so, both immortals had become prisoners of their own creations. Their empires now demanded their immortality, their perfection, their presence—forever."

Then the Overlords arrived and Hell on Earth could no longer be denied.\n\nThe first year was a disaster every day. The mountain of dead, on the streets and in our homes, grew larger by the minute. The survivors either turned to prayer, cowered in whatever place they thought safe, or ended their life only to rise again as one of the Fallen.\n\nA year was all it took. A year to gather our senses. A year to get braver. A year to grow our strength. On the anniversary of the Rising, we attacked in full force. The Overlords were felled, their minions dispatched. The weight of the world's power, in unison, was flung at the enemy. There was no mercy.\n\nThe culmination of our efforts was the launching of our nuclear weapons into the breaches.\n\nHell had risen and we had beat it down. Earth is a quieter place now. A better place. We are safer. We are united.",
    "MGT": "In 2021, the world was turned upside down when the legions of Hell erupted from the depths. Cities crumbled under the fiery onslaught, and humanity struggled against the relentless tide of demons. Chaos reigned as fear gripped the hearts of millions. Yet, in the darkest hour, humanity found its resolve. Scientists, theologians, and warriors united, discovering ways to repel the infernal invaders. A year of horror passed, but hope remained.\n\nBy 2022, Earth was poised to strike back. Driven by vengeance and survival, humanity crafted weapons infused with celestial energy and forged alliances with ancient, mystical forces. The time had come to invade Hell itself. An elite force, known as the Vanguard, descended into the abyss, armed with knowledge and the fierce determination of their kind.\n\nHell was a realm of nightmares: landscapes of boiling rivers, towering obsidian mountains, and skies choked with ash. The Vanguard fought through hordes of demonic creatures, their souls burning with righteous fury. With every skirmish, they pushed deeper, disrupting the demonic hierarchy and sowing discord among the infernal ranks.\n\nIn the heart of Hell, they confronted the demon lords, wielding weapons forged with celestial light. The battle raged, echoing across the infernal planes. Humanity's defiance was unyielding, and as the demon lords fell, Earth reclaimed its future. Invasion complete, the world breathed free once more."

To picture her brings an inexplicable sense of warmth, of comfort, and the knowledge that the world is better for her existence. Truly golden hair that frames her face. Eyes that are somewhere between the lightest green and the deepest blue. As if a new color was created for her alone to grace upon this world. When she looks back I'm utterly helpless and yet totally invincible. Time spent with her is the closest to paradise I'm sure I'll ever get. Time spent away from her is crippling torture with only the thought of her radiant smile and ever optimistic nature to keep me from going mad. She is my sole motivation. She gets me out of bed in the morning. I would sacrifice anything and everything for her happiness. Yet, I hesitate. She seems so far away yet so attainable. I question myself every moment we spend together. I should be able to tell her, but I stop myself before I have the chance to form those words. The words that would set my world right again or completely shatter it. Fear stops me. Fear of the two simple options before me and ending up with the wrong one. I always hesitate. Instead, I choose the third option. My own personal purgatory. With that option I'm safe. Safe to be close to her with that smile. Safe to never know what could have been. Safe to know her without repercussions. Safe to never experience what actual love may be. With that third option, I'm perfectly safe to never be heartbroken or deal with true pain and loss.",

Elena sat cross-legged on the floor, her eyes closed, breathing in the scent of lavender that soothed her restless mind. As she sank deeper into relaxation, an image began to form behind her closed eyelids—an old, weathered door standing alone in a field of wildflowers.\n\nThe door was a deep, rich mahogany, its surface intricately carved with swirling patterns that hinted at stories untold. Vines of ivy crept up its sides, their lush green tendrils wrapping around the doorknob, as if nature itself sought to reclaim it. Despite its rustic appearance, the door exuded an aura of mystery and allure, inviting Elena to explore what lay beyond.\n\nIn her mind's eye, she approached the door, feeling the soft earth beneath her feet and the gentle brush of petals against her skin. Her hand reached out, fingers brushing over the cool metal of the knob, and with a deep breath, she turned it. The door swung open with a creak, revealing a world bathed in the golden light of a setting sun.\n\nBeyond the door was a landscape unlike any she had known—a sprawling meadow of endless possibilities, where the sky melted into hues of pink and orange, and a gentle breeze whispered secrets in a language only nature understood. Birds flitted overhead, their songs intertwining in a symphony of joy and freedom.\n\nElena stepped through, feeling a sense of liberation that she hadn't felt in years. Here, time seemed to stand still, and the burdens of the world faded to a distant memory. She wandered through the meadow, arms outstretched, embracing the beauty and serenity that surrounded her.\n\nIn this magical realm, she felt a profound connection to all that was, a reminder of the simple, unadulterated beauty that lay within and around her. As she opened her eyes, the image lingered, a testament to the power of imagination and the endless possibilities it held within."

A plush armchair beckoned me, and I sank into it, pulling a random book from the shelf. It was a first edition of a classic I’d always meant to read but had never found the time for.\n\nHours, or perhaps days, passed in blissful solitude. The only sounds were the gentle rustling of pages and the occasional soft thud of a book being closed. I thought about the irony of finding such peace in hell.\n\nEventually, a flustered demon appeared, mumbling apologies about a clerical error. \"This is someone else's eternal punishment,\" he said, cheeks flushed.

Tired of the monotonous cycle, she tossed her phone aside and wandered over to the window, hoping for something—anything—to break the dullness.\n\nShe gazed out at the world beyond, at the street lined with identical brick buildings, the parked cars, and the occasional pedestrian. Just as she began to lose hope of finding anything interesting, a flash of color caught her eye. A young woman, dressed in a vibrant red dress, stood at the corner with a large sign. Lena squinted, trying to make out what it said: \"Dance Like Nobody's Watching.\"\n\nIntrigued, Lena watched as the woman placed a small speaker on the ground. Music began to play, and without hesitation, the woman started to dance. Her movements were joyful, uninhibited, each step full of life and energy. Passersby paused, some smiling, others bemused. A few joined in, their awkward attempts at dancing adding to the spectacle.\n\nLena felt a tug at her heart. The scene outside was a reminder of the simple pleasures she had forgotten amidst her routine. The woman's infectious enthusiasm spread, and Lena found herself tapping her foot in time with the music.\n\nAs the impromptu street dance continued, Lena noticed more people joining in—an elderly couple, a group of teenagers, and even a businesswoman who had set her briefcase down. The street had transformed into a vibrant tapestry of movement and laughter.\n\nLena chuckled to herself, feeling lighter than she had in weeks. Sometimes, she realized, all it took to break the monotony was a spark of spontaneity and a willingness to embrace the unexpected rhythm of life."

Her lantern flickered as she stood frozen near the wrought iron gates, her pulse quickening. The sound was beautiful and terrible, each chime a cry for attention from the earth below. She gripped her shawl tightly, her breath visible in the cold air, and stepped inside.\n\nThe graves seemed alive. The bells danced as if possessed, their rusted cords stretched taut. Margaret stumbled forward, her lantern casting flickering shadows over the headstones. Her mind raced with questions—was it the wind? A prank? But deep down, she knew better. The ground itself seemed to hum, and the air felt thick with something ancient.\n\nShe knelt by the nearest grave, marked \"Elizabeth Moore, 1867–1924,\" and hesitated before pulling the cord attached to the bell. The ringing ceased immediately, but the silence was worse. A low groan emanated from the earth beneath her feet, rattling her bones. She scrambled back, her heart hammering.

He tugged at the lapels of his trench coat, the brisk air biting his skin. It was a dangerous mission, one not easily understood by the uninitiated. But for David, a historian with an odd fascination for cultural symbols, it was a calling.\n\nHis mission was simple: save the Toothbrush mustache from the dark legacy that was about to taint it forever. Before it became synonymous with one of history's most reviled figures, it had been a symbol of the working man, pragmatism, and even comedy, thanks to Charlie Chaplin. David was determined to restore its original significance.\n\nNavigating the bustling streets, David blended with a crowd gathered around a newsstand. The war loomed heavily over the city, casting a shadow of suspicion and fear.

The association is strong.\"\n\n\"I know,\" David replied, his voice resolute. \"But symbols can change, and it's worth the effort.\"\n\nOver the next few weeks, David and Friedrich orchestrated a subtle campaign, persuading influential figures to adopt the mustache. They spread rumors of a new cultural movement, one that celebrated individuality and resilience.\n\nSlowly, whispers of the \"Reclaimed Mustache\" began to surface. Artists in Paris, actors in London, and musicians across Europe started to adopt the style, each wearing it as a badge of defiance against tyranny.\n\nDavid's time in Berlin was coming to an end. As he prepared to return to his own time, he glanced at a newspaper headline: \"The Mustache of the People.\" He smiled, knowing he had sown the seeds of change.\n\nThe time machine roared to life, and David vanished, leaving behind a world subtly altered by the power of a reclaimed symbol."

    "MGT": "The sun hung low over the horizon, casting an amber glow across the sprawling landscape. Jed McAllister adjusted his grip on the reins, guiding his steed—a sleek, metallic hover-bike—over the dusty terrain of Mars. The red dust kicked up in spirals as his bike zipped across the desolate landscape, the twin moons rising slowly behind him.\n\nJed was a lawman, one of the last of his kind in the Martian frontier. The settlement of New Terra was just a speck in the distance, shimmering under the protective dome that kept the harsh elements at bay. With a determined gaze, he scanned the horizon, searching for any sign of the outlaws that had been terrorizing the mining outposts.\n\nHis hand hovered over the laser revolver strapped to his side, a relic of a bygone era. It was a gift from his father, one of the original pioneers who’d come to Mars seeking fortune and adventure. The revolver’s grip felt reassuringly familiar in his hand, a connection to the past in this new, untamed world.\n\nAs Jed approached a ridge, the shadows grew longer, and he caught sight of movement below. The outlaws, clad in dust-covered exo-suits, were unloading crates from a stolen cargo hauler. He revved the hover-bike’s engine, the low hum cutting through the stillness, and descended upon them like a comet.\n\n\"Time to round up some trouble,\" he muttered, the thrill of the chase igniting a fire within him."

The army stood in tense silence, their breaths visible in the biting air, their armor dull under the overcast sky. At the front of the formation, General Kael strode onto a makeshift platform, his crimson cape snapping in the wind. His face was lined with the scars of battles past, his eyes sharp and fierce despite the weight of the day.\n\nHe raised a hand, and the murmurs among the soldiers ceased. The only sound was the distant cry of a raven—a grim omen, some might think, but Kael saw it as a challenge. He scanned the faces before him, young and old, weary and determined. They were not just soldiers. They were farmers, blacksmiths, merchants. They were people who had been thrust into this war not by choice but by necessity.\n\n\"Brothers and sisters!\" Kael's voice boomed, carrying over the wind. \"Today, the enemy stands at our gates, believing us weak, believing us broken. They see only the ashes of our homes and the grief in our hearts. But they are wrong. They do not see what burns beneath those ashes—a fire that cannot be extinguished!\"\n\nA cheer rippled through the crowd, faint at first, then growing stronger.\n\n\"They come with their ranks of polished knights and banners of gold, thinking it is wealth and might that wins wars. But I tell you this—victory belongs not to the proud but to the steadfast! It belongs to those who fight for what cannot be stolen: our families, our freedom, our home!\"\n\nKael drew his sword, the blade gleaming even in the dim light. \"Today, we fight not as individuals but as one! As long as even one of us still draws breath, they will never take what is ours!\"\n\nThe army roared in unison, their fear replaced by resolve. Kael turned, raising his sword toward the horizon. \"Now, to battle! For home! For each other!\" \n\nAnd with that, they charged, a tide of defiance surging toward the storm."

It all started with the installation of community cameras, a project intended to bolster neighborhood safety. However, it quickly spiraled beyond its initial purpose.\n\nThe cameras, placed at every street corner and in every public space, became the town’s eyes. But it wasn’t the cameras alone that surveilled. Each resident had access to the live feeds through an app on their phones. At first, it was a novelty, a way to check for traffic or see what local events were happening. But soon, it became an obsession.\n\nNeighbors began monitoring one another, whispering about who was seen where and with whom. Mrs. Jensen, the retired schoolteacher, took meticulous notes about teenagers sneaking out past curfew. Mr. Lee, the grocer, tracked the comings and goings of customers, making judgments on their purchases.\n\nPrivacy eroded as vigilance turned into scrutiny. People became actors in their daily lives, performing for unseen eyes. Friendships frayed under the weight of constant observation. Trust was replaced by suspicion.\n\nIn this town, the phrase \"big brother is watching\" took on a new meaning, as each resident became the watcher and the watched, trapped in a web of their own making."

Smooth?\nWow, I guess dying isn't so bad after all.\n\n\nRubbing my eyes open, I anticipated the endless clouds and golden gates that would be my next eternity. I was wrong.\n\nI was standing in a line. I was standing in a line outside a dingy nightclub. All the tell-tale signs were here. The passed out twenty-somethings on the floor, the green-ish puddle of puke beside my right shoe, and the loud thump of the roaring bass from within the club, drowning out what sounded like chatter of thousands and thousands of people. There was even a sporadically flashing neon sign above the entrance reading \"HEAV N;\" the second \"E\" wasn't turning on.\n\nSomething was odd though. The scene didn't have the depressing, self loathing, sorrowful drab of an undercurrent that the conventional club of this type usually did. No, actually everyone in line was smiling and eager.

I was ready for pearly gates, for angelic choirs, for rewards earned through faith and virtue.\n\nInstead, I was in a diner.\n\nThe kind with cracked red vinyl booths and a faint smell of burnt coffee lingering in the air. A jukebox softly played a tune I didn’t recognize. Confused, I glanced around. A waitress approached, wearing a name tag that read “Joy.” She smiled at me warmly, but there was something ancient in her eyes, like she’d seen too many lifetimes to count.\n\n“You’re up,” she said, setting a steaming cup of coffee in front of me.

The… the judgment?”\n\nJoy leaned against the counter and looked at me with a mixture of amusement and pity. “Judgment? Sweetheart, you’ve got it all wrong. There’s no judging here. You were always looking for someone to tell you if you were ‘good’ or ‘bad.’ But we don’t do that.”\n\nI frowned. “Then what’s the point? I lived my life trying to be righteous.”\n\nShe raised an eyebrow. “Righteous according to whose standards? You spent so much time worrying about rules, you forgot to live. That’s what we’re here to talk about.”\n\nI opened my mouth to protest, but the words caught in my throat. She slid a menu across the table. “Order anything you want. Then we’ll chat. You’ve got eternity to figure it out.”\n\nI stared at the menu. Pancakes, eggs, hash browns. Heaven, it seemed, was simpler—and much harder—than I’d ever imagined."

My coworker Lisa, who had a vivid birthmark on her left cheek, now had it on her right. I almost pointed it out, but decided against it. Maybe I’d just remembered wrong.\n\nLater, I stopped by my favorite café. The barista who always flirted with me handed over my latte without so much as a glance. He didn’t even smile.

My neighbor’s dog, always a cheerful golden retriever, now growled at me through the fence, its eyes strangely human-like. The street I’d walked down for years now had an unfamiliar bakery tucked between the hardware store and pharmacy. Its sign read \"Yesterday's Bread\" in crooked, hand-painted letters. I peeked inside once, only to be met with empty shelves and a clerk who stared at me without blinking.\n\nThe breaking point came one evening when I called my mom. Her voice was warm, familiar, but she kept referring to events that had never happened—my “trip to France last summer,” the “promotion” I never got. When I tried to correct her, she grew quiet. “Are you feeling alright, honey?” she asked slowly, her voice tinged with something that sounded like fear.\n\nThat night, I lay awake in bed, staring at the ceiling, listening to the faint hum of the world around me. It sounded wrong—like a frequency just slightly out of tune. I wanted to believe I was imagining things. But deep down, I knew: this wasn’t my world anymore."

Tom's face was a mask of calm, yet something in his eyes was different, a glint of something unfamiliar.\n\n\"You okay?\" Jake asked, trying to shake off the creeping unease.\n\n\"Yeah,\" Tom replied, his voice steady but somehow hollow. \"Just got a bit turned around.\"\n\nJake forced a laugh, but it sounded wrong in the stillness. They resumed their spots by the fire, Tom's presence now unsettlingly unfamiliar. \n\nAs the night wore on, Jake watched his friend closely.

It was an ordinary night in the modern world, and I expected to wake up to the same routine.\n\nBut as my eyes fluttered open, the world was anything but ordinary.

The air was thick with the scent of vegetation, fresh and untouched by human hands.\n\nI staggered to my feet, my heart pounding in my chest. Everywhere I looked, I saw lush greenery, towering trees, and thick underbrush. The cityscape was replaced by a dense, prehistoric jungle, teeming with life. I was no longer in my familiar urban environment; I was somewhere else entirely.\n\nSuddenly, a rustling noise caught my attention. I turned, and my breath hitched. Emerging from the thicket was a creature unlike anything I’d ever seen—massive, with a long neck and a body that seemed to stretch forever. It was a dinosaur, a true living relic from a time long before humans. The sight was awe-inspiring, yet terrifying.\n\nI stumbled backward, my mind racing to comprehend the impossible. I had somehow traveled 60 million years into the past, to an era where humans were mere whispers in the future. Panic threatened to overwhelm me, but curiosity tugged at my thoughts. This was a world untouched by modern civilization, a chance to experience the raw beauty of Earth in its infancy.\n\nAs I navigated this ancient landscape, I encountered more wonders—a herd of triceratops grazing peacefully, pterosaurs soaring overhead, and the distant roar of a predator echoing through the trees. Every moment was a revelation, an opportunity to learn and adapt.\n\nTime seemed to stretch, blending days into weeks, until I found myself accepting this new existence. The vibrant ecosystem became my home, and I learned to live alongside creatures that I had only ever seen in textbooks. In this forgotten world, I discovered a peace and simplicity that modern life had long overshadowed. Yet, deep down, I knew this was a temporary chapter—a surreal adventure in the vast tapestry of time."

No one knew who they were—only that they came without warning, leaving ruin in their wake. \n\nHarris stood at the edge of the town square, his calloused hands trembling as he gripped the hilt of his rusted sword. He was no soldier, just a blacksmith, but when the mayor called for volunteers, Harris had stepped forward. Someone had to stand, even if it meant standing alone.\n\nAround him, a ragtag group of townsfolk gathered, clutching pitchforks, axes, and crude weaponry. Their faces were pale, their breaths shallow. Beyond the hills, the horizon glowed an unnatural red, the distant crackle of fire and screams carried on the wind. They were coming.\n\nHarris tightened his grip, ignoring the knot in his stomach. He thought of his wife and daughter, hidden in the cellar beneath their shop. He thought of their laughter, the way his daughter clung to his arm when she was scared. He would protect them—or die trying.\n\nThe ground trembled as shadows poured over the hilltop, a tide of chaos descending. As the first figure emerged—a towering brute clad in black armor—Harris raised his sword and roared. The others joined him, their voices shaking the heavens. If they were to fall, they would fall fighting."

A laugh.\n\nAnd that smell.\n\nThey say I barely made it. Actually, they say I *didn't* make it for a few minutes. Luckily, they were able to bring me back.\n\nWhen I woke up, my nostrils burned with that scent. I couldn't immediately identify it, it dissipated pretty quickly, but it wasn't long before I smelled it again.\n\nThe guy in the hospital bed next to me began to reek of it a few hours before he suffered a massive heart attack. He didn't last the night.\n\nSince then, I've encountered that smell in other places. Sometimes it's just a whiff of someone on the bus and sometimes, in places like old folks' homes, so much of it accumulates that other people smell it too.\n\nI don't know how or why, but it hangs in the air around people who aren't long for this world. It's always been there, I just never really noticed it until I crossed the barrier myself.\n\nAnd there it is again. So strong that I can't smell the alcohol I know must be on my friend's breath after our night out. He's fumbling with his keys.\n\n\"Hey man,\" I shout, masking my concern, \"Split a cab with me. We can head back out here for your car tomorrow.\"\n\nHe protests, but he's either too drunk or too tired to persist. As we pack into the cab, I nervously take a deep breath.

Sam had always wondered why nursing homes carried that distinct odor, why his grandmother’s house smelled like the pages of forgotten books wrapped in something heavy and inevitable. Today, he understood.\n\nIt started when his grandmother, frail and tethered to her favorite armchair, mentioned seeing \"him.\" Her voice was calm, as if she were discussing a neighbor. \"He’s kind,\" she said, her cloudy eyes staring somewhere beyond Sam. \"Not like what you’d imagine. No scythe. Just quiet, with a smell like old rain.\"\n\nSam had laughed nervously. \"That’s just the air in here, Grandma. You know, old houses and all.\"\n\nBut her words stuck with him. Over the next few weeks, he began noticing the smell everywhere she went. It clung to her blankets, her tea mugs, even the pages of the crossword puzzle she half-heartedly completed each morning. And then, one evening, he smelled it somewhere else—on the bus. An elderly man sat two rows ahead, hunched over and breathing laboriously. The scent was unmistakable. Sam’s stomach churned.\n\nHe started paying attention, and the pattern emerged like a cruel puzzle. Every time he caught the smell on someone, they would pass away within days. A woman at the grocery store, the janitor at his office building, the old man feeding pigeons in the park. It wasn’t a coincidence. It was a warning.\n\nOne night, Sam stayed late at his grandmother’s house, determined to ask her more. But as he sat beside her, he felt it—a presence, soft and unassuming, filling the room. The smell grew stronger, suffocating. He turned, and there he was. The figure was unremarkable, cloaked in shadows, but the air around him hummed with inevitability.\n\n\"She’s ready,\" the figure said, his voice like a whisper carried on the wind.\n\nSam wanted to scream, to fight, but his grandmother smiled. \"It’s all right,\" she murmured. \"I’ve smelled him for months. It’s just time.\"\n\nAnd then she was gone, leaving only the scent behind."

He had planned this moment for so long, meticulously plotting each step, ensuring no detail was overlooked. His heart pounded with a rhythm that seemed to echo the anticipation of what was to come.\n\n\"Why are you doing this?\" the man in the chair whispered, his voice trembling.\n\nMichael took a deep breath, trying to calm the storm inside. His mind replayed the numerous documentaries, the books, the endless hours spent understanding the psyche of those who had walked this path before him. This was his moment of transformation. He was not just claiming a life; he was claiming his own identity.\n\n\"Why?\" Michael repeated, almost to himself. \"It's not about why, really. It's about becoming.\"\n\nThe man in the chair struggled against his bonds, but they held firm. Michael had made sure of that. He stepped closer, his shadow casting a dark veil over the man's face. He could see the sheen of sweat, the rapid rise and fall of his chest.\n\n\"Please, I have a family,\" the man pleaded, his voice cracking.\n\nFor a brief moment, Michael hesitated. A flicker of doubt crossed his mind, but it was quickly extinguished by the thought of what lay ahead—the notoriety, the whispered stories that would follow his name. He had longed for a sense of power, of control, and this was where it began.\n\n\"Everyone has a family,\" Michael replied, almost gently. \"But this is about me.\"\n\nWith a sense of purpose, he moved forward. This would be the first of many steps, the first chapter in a tale he would write with blood and silence. As he reached out, a strange calm settled over him. The transformation was complete. Michael was no longer just another man—he was becoming legend."

She sat at the kitchen table, sipping coffee, scrolling through her phone. “You hate coffee,” I said, watching her reaction. She blinked, confused. “Uh, no, I love coffee,” she replied.\n\nPerfect. I could twist the lies to nudge people toward the truth.\n\nI spent the day navigating conversations like a wordsmith dancing on quicksand. When my boss asked if I’d finished the report, I said, “I haven’t even started,” though I’d completed it yesterday. His eyebrows shot up. “You mean it’s done?” he asked. I nodded, relieved.\n\nBut the curse wasn’t without its pitfalls. At the grocery store, I told the cashier, “I don’t need a receipt because I didn’t buy anything,” which led to a drawn-out explanation that I had indeed purchased items. My lies were a puzzle people had to solve, and the frustration wore on me.\n\nBy evening, exhaustion pressed down on me. Sarah noticed my silence and asked, “Are you okay?” I wanted to scream the truth: “No, I’m trapped in a world where honesty feels impossible!” Instead, I whispered, “I’ve never felt better.”\n\nShe narrowed her eyes, then hugged me. Somehow, she understood. Maybe the truth didn’t only live in words. Maybe it could shine through actions, through the cracks in a curse, through the quiet persistence of an honest heart."

    "MGT": "The town of Eldermoor had always been shrouded in mystery, nestled between dense forests and whispering streams. For years, tales circulated about TheWritingSniper, an enigmatic figure who, with the precision of a marksman, penned stories that pierced the soul. Some said he lived deep in the woods, crafting narratives that could make even the hardest hearts weep.\n\nOne autumn evening, young Elara, a spirited dreamer with a love for stories, decided to uncover the truth. Armed with a notebook and a heart full of curiosity, she ventured into the forest. The air was crisp, leaves crunching underfoot as she walked deeper, guided only by moonlight and her own determination.\n\nAfter hours of wandering, she stumbled upon a quaint cabin, its windows aglow with warm light. Gathering her courage, Elara knocked. The door creaked open, revealing a kindly old man with twinkling eyes. \n\n“Ah, a fellow storyteller,” he greeted, inviting her inside. Over the next few hours, they exchanged tales, laughter, and wisdom. Elara realized that TheWritingSniper’s true gift wasn’t just his stories, but his ability to inspire others to find their own voice. \n\nWhen she left, the forest felt less mysterious, and her heart was full."

The only problem that I have encountered so far was the language barrier, but I brought translators from the states with me.\n\nI have been worrying about today though. I am meeting with ambassadors from South Korea at 5 o'clock for a dinner meeting.

My email was bombarded with messages from journalists, political analysts, and bewildered acquaintances.

He made his way through the house, turning on every faucet he found. Finally, he came to the kitchen, triggered the sprinkler head, and waited as water splashed from the ceiling. Five or six kids, he thought, would fly down the stairs into the kitchen – the common area of the house – where he could scare the living shit out of them. But no one came immediately.

He was a master of the unseen, slipping into homes unnoticed, leaving screams and chaos in his wake.\n\nOne autumn evening, Everett glided into a cozy suburban home. The scent of cinnamon and freshly baked cookies lingered in the air. Perfect, he thought. He started his routine by rattling a picture frame on the mantle, letting it fall with a satisfying clatter.

A memory surfaced—his last moments alive, alone in a cold hospital bed, longing for someone to hold his hand.\n\nThe girl walked closer, her tiny hand extending as though to comfort him. Everett recoiled. He couldn’t bear it. He fled from the house, his ethereal form trembling. \n\nFor days, he avoided haunting anyone, drifting aimlessly through the town.

His suit was pristine, yet it looked like no fabric I'd ever seen. The woman beside him tilted her head, her golden hair catching the fluorescent lights. They didn’t speak immediately, just stared at me as though they were scanning every molecule of my existence.\n\n\"You are called Alex,\" the man finally said, his voice deep and resonant. It wasn’t a question.\n\n\"Y-yeah,\" I said, my heart racing. How did he know my name?\n\n\"You will listen carefully,\" the woman added, her voice softer but equally commanding. \"We need to speak with you. Now.\"\n\nI glanced around the restaurant. My manager was somewhere in the back, probably on her phone. The handful of customers were staring, but no one intervened. I felt a strange pull—like I was being compelled against my will but with no force applied. \n\n\"Uh, okay,\" I said, stepping out from behind the counter. \"What do you want?\"\n\nThe man gestured to the door, and I followed them outside, my grease-stained uniform feeling woefully inadequate. The air smelled of fryer oil and impending rain.\n\n\"You have questions,\" the woman said, her gaze piercing. \"We will answer one. Choose wisely.\"\n\nMy mind raced. They weren’t human, but they looked human. They knew my name. And something about their presence felt ancient, like the weight of their existence pressed down on the world itself. \n\nFinally, I blurted, \"Why me?\"\n\nThe man’s lips curved into a faint smile. \"Because your blood carries the mark of our past. You are descended from those we left behind.\"\n\n\"But why—\"\n\n\"Enough,\" the woman interrupted. \"Soon, you will understand.\" And with that, they vanished, leaving me standing in the parking lot with the weight of a million years suddenly on my shoulders."

The room was spinning, my eyes were trying to crawl out of my head, desperately trying to unsee what I had irrevocably seen.

My parents would sneak off at night to this forbidden room, would quickly turn off the TV when anyone walked in the living room, would whisper in each other's ears, no doubt talking about... about... *that*.\n\nI slid down the hallway wall and desperately tried to swing shut the door behind me. The door only bounced back open leaving the whole room in plain view, scaring me. I tried to shut my eyes, but the images were burned into them, for eternity. What was I supposed to do? What would happen if my friends ever found out? High School would be Hell. I'd be the kid with the parents who-\n\nI had sudden convulsions just thinking about the consequences. No! It can't be! I refuse to believe it! But when I opened my eyes there it was before me, the evidence strewn about the room and plastered on the walls, covering every inch.

Today, however, the house was quiet, the lure of that door far too potent to resist. I stood before it, heart racing, hand hesitating on the tarnished brass knob.\n\nWith a deep breath, I turned the handle and stepped inside. Dust motes danced in the beam of light that sliced through the gloom, revealing a room frozen in time. An old phonograph stood on a table, its needle resting gently on a forgotten record. Books filled the shelves, their spines faded but proud, whispering secrets from another era.\n\nIn the corner, an easel stood with a canvas draped in a white sheet. I approached, drawn by an inexplicable pull, and hesitated before pulling the sheet away. The painting underneath took my breath away. It was a portrait of a young woman, her eyes alight with a mischievous glint, a smile playing at her lips. I recognized her instantly. My mother, but younger, vibrant, untouched by the passage of time.\n\nBeneath the painting lay a stack of letters tied with a faded ribbon. Curiosity piqued, I untied them and began to read. They were love letters, filled with poetry and passion, addressed to my mother but signed by a name I did not recognize. My heart sank as the realization dawned. This was the secret my parents had guarded, a love before my father, a chapter left unwritten in the story I thought I knew.\n\nI backed away slowly, my mind a whirl of emotions, carefully closing the door behind me.

Sleek, angular designs hovered above the atmosphere, their technology alien yet unmistakably human.\n\nDrake turned to her science officer, Lieutenant Commander Rios. “Analysis?”\n\n“Human DNA signatures aboard those vessels,” Rios replied, his voice tight with disbelief. “Approximately ninety-eight percent identical to Earth-based humanity. This colony predates any known space exploration from Earth.”\n\nElena’s fingers drummed the armrest of her chair. “Open a channel.

We built a new home here, on Aurelia.”\n\nThe revelation sent murmurs through the Resolute’s bridge. Elena leaned forward. “Commander Coren, we had no idea your people existed.

Exhausted and cornered in an alley, he found himself face-to-face with a lone zombie. In a moment of desperation, as the creature lunged, Leo bit it back, his teeth sinking into the cold, decaying flesh. He expected nothing more than his inevitable end, but then something miraculous happened: the zombie staggered backward, its eyes losing their lifeless glaze. Slowly, the creature transformed, its pallor fading, the gaping wounds healing, until it was human once more.\n\nThe newly restored person was bewildered, but alive. Word of Leo's accidental discovery spread quickly among the scattered bands of survivors. Hope, a forgotten sentiment, began to seep back into their hearts. They realized that they could reclaim their world, one bite at a time.\n\nIn the following weeks, groups of brave volunteers roamed the zombie-infested lands, risking their lives to bite the undead. They became known as the \"Reverse Biters,\" and their ranks grew as more people witnessed the astonishing transformation. Each successful bite returned another soul to humanity, and slowly, the tide began to turn.\n\nCommunities rebuilt, fortified by the knowledge that they could fight back in the strangest of ways.

Sam slid the tape into the player, the machine groaning to life as the spools began to turn.  \n\nA haunting melody spilled into the room, a slow piano tune that seemed to breathe with an ancient rhythm. The singer's voice, low and smoky, sang of lost places and faces blurred by time. Sam could almost taste the remnants of cigarette smoke and hear the faint clink of glasses in some distant tavern.  \n\nThe lyrics hinted at secrets—a meeting under the clock tower, letters left unsent, a name whispered but never explained. Sam felt a strange pull, as though the song were speaking directly to their own forgotten past.  \n\nThen, just as the melody seemed to unravel, the tape warped, the voice distorting into static before abruptly cutting off. Sam rewound it, but it wouldn’t play. Frustrated, they flipped the cassette over.  \n\nThe B-side held no music—only a voice. It was quieter, somber. “If you found this... I hope you remember. The clock tower, tomorrow, at dawn. It’s not too late.”  \n\nSam shivered. Tomorrow was the anniversary of the fire."

It was the latest innovation in psychological technology—a mirror that revealed not the physical appearance but the self-image of whoever stood before it.\n\nOne rainy afternoon, Anna, a young woman with a quiet demeanor, found herself drawn to the boutique. She hesitated at the entrance, her reflection visible in the rain-dappled window. Taking a deep breath, she stepped inside, her curiosity outweighing her apprehension.\n\nThe mirror stood prominently in the center of the room, surrounded by an aura of mystery. Anna approached it cautiously, her heart pounding with anticipation. She peered into the glass, and the reflection she saw was not of her current self, but a version of her she had long forgotten.\n\nThe mirror showed a vibrant, confident woman, her eyes sparkling with ambition and joy. This was how Anna once saw herself before life’s challenges dimmed her spirit. Tears welled in her eyes as she realized the potential still within her.\n\nAnna left the boutique with a renewed sense of purpose, the mirror's image etched in her memory. It was a reminder that self-perception could be reshaped, and with it, the world she inhabited."

He was wearing a tie-dye hoodie, cargo shorts, and sunglasses. His hair was an untamed mess, and his grin was wide and lazy.\n\n“Yo,” he said, stretching like he’d just woken up. “I’m Khal, your bong genie. Thanks for summoning me, man. It’s been a while.”\n\nMy brain, already clouded by the hit I'd just taken, struggled to process what was happening. “Wait. Genie? From my bong?”\n\n“Yup,” he said, plopping down on the couch beside me. “I grant three wishes. Standard genie deal. But, like... can we take it slow? I’m pretty baked.”\n\nI blinked at him, then burst out laughing. “You’re high?”\n\n“Dude, you’re ripping smoke out of my house. Of course I’m high.” Khal rubbed his eyes and reached for the bag of chips on the table. “Anyway, you get three wishes. What’ll it be?”\n\nI thought about it for a moment, my mind wandering to absurd possibilities. “Okay, first wish: I want infinite weed.”\n\nKhal snorted. “Classic. Done.” He snapped his fingers, and suddenly, a massive glass jar appeared on the table, packed to the brim with the fluffiest green I’d ever seen. “This stuff is primo. Grows back every time you take some. You’re welcome.”\n\nI stared at the jar, then back at him. “Second wish… I want a pizza. Like, right now.”\n\n“Man, you’re really keeping it chill,” Khal said, chuckling. He snapped his fingers again, and a steaming pepperoni pizza materialized in front of us. I grabbed a slice, the cheese stretching gloriously as I took a bite.\n\n“Alright,” Khal said, leaning back. “Last wish. Make it count.”\n\nI chewed thoughtfully, my brain moving slower than usual. “Okay… I wish…” I paused, giggling. “I wish you’d hang out here forever.”\n\nKhal raised an eyebrow. “Forever, huh? Bold move. But honestly, I’m down.” He snapped his fingers one last time, and the bong glowed faintly. “Done. Guess I’m your roommate now.”\n\nWe spent the rest of the night eating pizza, passing the bong, and laughing at nothing. It was the beginning of a weird, wonderful friendship."

He would be surrounded by darkness on all sides, neglecting dinner and talking to no one. His chair had begun to creak over the years, but like everything else, he took no notice; unable to see anything despite the cold blue light that floated about the room.\n\nQuestions were scarce and now I wish I had asked them. What I saw through the glass of his office door was distorted, an image curled and stretched by a thin barrier put up between him and us. I never wanted to be that -- I didn't want the glass, I wanted the feel of the table cloth, the talk over dinner, the company of my family.\n\nLittle did I know what happened behind those doors. Each key was a string to somewhere in the world -- Berlin, Tokyo, D. C., and when he died, the world continued anyway. A room tucked away in the suburbs had gone dark, but all around homes grew with a distant warmth as night met the day as if it were any other.\n\nThe screen still teemed with life in that darkness, staring back at me as I sat in that same chair, deaf to the creaking. My fingertips felt along the keys, letters kissed by the faint moonlight, and as the machine grew to its lively hum once more, I looked to the door and saw out clearly into a room now empty.\n\nA table sat alone in the middle of it, stripped of its cloth, silverware, china -- a stillness disturbed by the whirring of the world.",

My father, a man I'd known to be nothing more than a quiet businessman, was gone. \n\nReturning home, expecting grief and the usual condolences, I was instead met with a strange request: a meeting in my father’s study. As I entered, the room felt different, charged with a purpose I couldn’t place. My mother sat in his leather chair, her face a mask of calm authority.\n\n“Evelyn,” she began, her voice steady, “there’s something you need to know about our family.”\n\nShe spoke of a legacy, a secret that had been passed down for generations. Our family controlled the economic levers of the world. The stock markets, the trade routes, even the financial stability of nations—each was delicately manipulated from the shadows of our home. I laughed, the absurdity of it too much to bear. But her eyes held a truth I couldn’t deny.\n\n“You’ve been chosen to continue this,” she said, sliding a leather-bound journal across the desk. It was filled with intricate notes, plans, and signatures of those who’d come before us.\n\nI spent the night poring over the journal, the weight of my newfound responsibility pressing heavily against my ideals. I had spent years fighting for fairness, yet here I was, expected to perpetuate the very systems I despised.\n\nAs dawn broke, I realized my role didn’t have to be one of compliance. Perhaps, from within, I could bring about the change I’d always advocated for. The power was terrifying, yet exhilarating in its potential. With a deep breath, I closed the journal and stepped into the new day, ready to reshape the world—not from the outside, but from its very heart."

No one offered their charger; energy was survival, and survival was selfish.\n\nLater, Ava walked home, her phone steady at 48%. She passed a boy sitting on the curb, his phone dead, his body limp. He looked up at her with pleading eyes. For a moment, she hesitated, then handed him her portable charger.

Super-speed to those that thing in terms of time, and how much they have. Strength for protection or iron will. Camouflage for the meek and shy. Flying to the dreamers. It's almost a rite of passage now, to obtain your own super powers.\n\nBut, when it first began, when we finally found something that makes people have super human powers. We didn't expect it to be so... Clusterfucky.\n\nThe way to obtain super powers is about as convoluted as the IRS, and twice as picky. The person who wishes to obtain a super-power must complete the most idiotic, weird ritual ever devised on this planet. The gaining of the super power is rather simple. An alien slug is inserted into the base of the spine, and melds with our brains. Simple, right?\n\nWrong.\n\nThe only people with these slugs are hippies. They expect the worst sort of things from you. Do a barrel roll, twist on your foot, hop on one foot and caw like a baboon while eating a banana. Slice a watermelon in half and carve it into a helmet. Then wear it.\n\nHow is it that these hippies have a monopoly on these damn slugs? I'll tell you. Only they know how to harvest and preserve them from space to Earth. None of the corporations have figured it out. The hippies say it's love and positive energy.

Dr. Elaine Carter and her team were working on a cure for degenerative nerve diseases when one of the lab assistants spilled the experimental compound into a vat of carbonated water. The result was... soda. Fizzing, glowing neon orange soda.\n\nElaine stared at the bubbling mess. \"Well, that's ruined.\"\n\n\"Should we clean it up?\" asked Mark, the assistant responsible for the spill.\n\n\"Not yet,\" Elaine said, curious despite herself. She scooped a sample into a glass vial and studied its chemical composition. It seemed harmless, just sugar and water bonded with their experimental formula—no toxins, no radiation. On a whim, she poured a little into a paper cup and took a sip.\n\nThe taste hit her like an electric shock—sweet, tangy, and impossibly refreshing. Her heart raced, her senses sharpened, and her body felt lighter, stronger. She reached for the microscope across the room and froze. The instrument was twenty feet away, but her arm stretched impossibly long, grasping it as though distance had ceased to exist.\n\n\"Elaine, are you okay?\" Mark asked, wide-eyed.\n\n\"I think I’m more than okay,\" she said, staring at her elastic limb in disbelief. She flexed her fingers, marveling at the seamless movement. \"This... this stuff did something to me.\"\n\nMark grabbed a cup and drank before Elaine could stop him. Almost immediately, his skin shimmered, turning translucent. He gasped, his body dissolving into pure light. He reappeared seconds later, standing by the far wall. \"I teleported!\"\n\nWithin hours, word spread around the lab. The soda—dubbed \"EvoFizz\"—gave anyone who drank it random superhuman abilities. Strength, speed, invisibility, flight—the possibilities were endless. But with power came chaos.\n\nElaine watched in horror as rival labs tried to steal samples, governments demanded control, and ordinary people clamored for a taste. Some abilities proved dangerous—one man accidentally set himself ablaze, another turned everything he touched into gold, including his own hands.\n\nElaine knew they had to destroy it before the world tore itself apart. But deep down, she wondered: Could EvoFizz be humanity’s next step? Or was it the beginning of their downfall?"

Or so I thought.\n\nI scrawled my signature hastily, the ink bleeding into the paper as lightning cracked outside. The devil smiled—a sharp, knowing grin—and snapped his fingers. In an instant, the contract disappeared, and I felt... lighter. Too light.\n\nThe next morning, I slid out of bed and stumbled, nearly falling flat. My feet tingled unnaturally. Looking down, I froze. My soles were gone. Not my soul, but my *soles*. The flesh beneath my feet was smooth, flat, and eerily tender, like polished marble.\n\nI tried to put on shoes, but they wouldn’t stay. Sneakers flopped uselessly, boots drooped, and even sandals slid off. Walking barefoot wasn’t just inconvenient; every pebble, crack, and splinter became a fresh torment. I cursed the devil and my own clumsy handwriting.\n\nThe wealth did come, but what good was it? My days were spent shuffling awkwardly, leaving behind faint, skinless prints wherever I went. People stared. I couldn’t run. Couldn’t dance. Couldn’t hide.\n\nThe devil checked in occasionally, his grin smug. \"Careful what you sign,\" he’d say, before vanishing in a puff of sulfur.\n\nAnd so, I walk—barefoot, forever."

Elara had spent her entire life preparing for this moment, yet now, as the reality of her departure settled in, she found it hard to let go.\n\nTurning from the window, she took a deep breath and moved through the cabin of the spacecraft. The walls hummed with the quiet assurance of technology built to withstand the rigors of interstellar travel. Every inch of the vessel was familiar, yet it felt foreign, a reminder that she was leaving everything she had ever known behind.\n\nHer mind drifted back to the day she was chosen for this mission. A chance to explore beyond the confines of Earth, to seek out new worlds and possibilities. It was a dream she had harbored since childhood, fueled by stories of astronauts and explorers who dared to push the boundaries of human potential. But dreams, she realized, often come with the weight of sacrifice.\n\nAs the engines roared to life, Elara made her way to the command module, strapping herself into the pilot's seat. The hum of machinery, the glow of instrument panels, all felt like a strange symphony guiding her away from home. She took one last look at the planet that had nurtured and taught her.\n\n\"Farewell, Planet Earth,\" she whispered, her voice barely audible over the thrumming engines. The spacecraft shuddered, and she felt the pull of gravity loosen its hold. In that moment, as the Earth began to recede from view, Elara's heart swelled with a mixture of hope and melancholy.\n\nShe was venturing into the unknown, leaving behind the familiar embrace of her world. But within her, a quiet determination burned brightly—she was ready to find what lay beyond the stars."

As the commander, I knew it was up to me. \n\nI glanced at my crew one last time, a mix of fear and determination etched on their faces. They trusted me, and I was ready to repay that trust with the ultimate sacrifice. With a deep breath, I braced myself and hit the release button.

I inhaled deeply, the sensation of air filling my lungs a perplexing miracle. \n\nThe suit was supposed to fail, to leave me gasping and frozen in the abyss. Yet here I was, alive, breathing, and strangely comfortable. Confusion mingled with relief, but there was no time to ponder the impossible. I focused on the task at hand, navigating through the debris to reach the thrusters. \n\nAs I worked, I thought of the stories of ancient astronauts who spoke of anomalies and mysteries of space that defied logic. Perhaps I was experiencing one such phenomenon. Perhaps space had chosen to spare me, or maybe there was more to the universe than we'd ever known.\n\nWith the thrusters redirected, the ship maneuvered smoothly away from danger. Exhausted but alive, I drifted back toward the airlock, the crew's cheers echoing in my helmet. I was ready to rejoin them, to unravel the mystery of my survival. But for now, all that mattered was that I had bought us time—precious moments to explore the unknown."

Lucy and my family bonded over shared humor and the occasional teasing.

In her head, her increasingly panicked mind was tracking the stranger in the hall, calculating when he would inevitably reach her door.

It wasn’t just the creaking floors or the flickering lights that made him uneasy; it was the sensation of being watched, an undeniable presence hovering just out of sight.\n\nDetermined to prove his rational mind, Lucas set about renovating the house. He spent his days stripping wallpaper and his nights researching its history, hoping to uncover anything that might explain the strange occurrences.

He swiftly typed, \"Social media has revolutionized modern communication by increasing accessibility, enhancing interactivity, and altering traditional social norms.\"\n\nWith the thesis in place, Eli’s fingers began to dance across the keyboard. He wrote about how platforms like Twitter and Instagram had made communication instantaneous, breaking barriers that once existed due to geographical constraints. He recalled statistics from one of the articles he’d skimmed earlier in the semester, weaving them into his argument seamlessly.\n\nHis thoughts flowed quicker now, like a river gaining momentum, as he discussed the interactive nature of social media. He mentioned the shift from passive consumption of information to active engagement, citing examples of viral movements and online communities. Words poured out of him, the urgency of the deadline fueling his creativity.\n\nFinally, Eli tackled the alteration of social norms. He described the rise of digital identities and the way people curated their lives for public consumption, drawing parallels to historical shifts in communication. As he reached the conclusion, he reaffirmed his thesis, emphasizing the profound impact social media had on communication practices.\n\nWith just five minutes to spare, Eli reviewed his paper for any glaring errors, correcting a few typos and adjusting awkward phrasing. He quickly uploaded the document to the submission portal, his hands trembling slightly as he clicked \"Submit.\"\n\nLeaning back, Eli let out a long breath, relief washing over him.

I want it to be based on my interpretation, not some arbitrary demonic standard.\"\n\nLucifer gritted his teeth, his patience wearing thin. He adjusted the contract again, the words reshaping to meet Alex’s demands. \"Satisfied now?\"\n\nAlex scanned the document once more, their brow furrowed in concentration. \"What about the clause about ‘unforeseen consequences’? That’s a catch-all for anything you might want to pull later.\"\n\nLucifer leaned back, his fingers steepled. \"You drive a hard bargain, Alex. But fine, I'll remove it. Just sign, and we can be done.\"\n\nAlex smirked, finally content with the revisions. They signed with a flourish, handing the contract back to Lucifer. The devil accepted it with a reluctant nod, a wry smile playing on his lips.\n\n\"You win this time, mortal,\" Lucifer said, his voice tinged with grudging respect. \"But remember, deals with the devil, no matter how carefully crafted, always come at a price.\"\n\nAlex left the office, the contract tucked safely away, wondering just what that price might eventually be."

Before him, a pedestal rose from the ground, upon it a glowing orb that seemed to pulse with a life of its own. It was said to hold the power to decide the fate of the world.\n\nAncient scripts had prophesied this moment, the choice that would determine the survival of humanity. Ethan had stumbled upon it by accident, or perhaps it was destiny. The orb presented him with an impossible choice: he could live, granting himself eternal life, but at the cost of every other soul on Earth. Or he could sacrifice himself, ensuring the survival of all mankind.\n\nHe stood there, grappling with the weight of the decision. Memories of loved ones flashed through his mind—his sister’s laughter, his mother’s reassuring hugs, his friends’ camaraderie. He thought of the billions of lives he held in his hands, each with their own stories, dreams, hopes. Could he really bear the burden of their deaths?\n\nThe orb beckoned him forward, its light growing more intense. Ethan closed his eyes, taking a deep breath. He’d always believed in the greater good, in the power of selflessness, but now confronted with his own mortality, fear clawed at his resolve. Yet, he knew what he had to do.\n\nWith trembling hands, he reached out, feeling the warmth of the orb seep into his skin. “I choose them,” he whispered, his voice steady despite the storm within. As soon as the words left his lips, a serene calm washed over him. The cavern faded away, replaced by a brilliant light, and Ethan felt himself dissolve into peace, knowing he had given the world another day."

I'll be in the middle of a casual conversation with the nice old woman who runs the flower shop, or the balding man at the deli counter, and then I'll be addressing the empty air as the bouquet of daisies or half-cut ham falls to the floor. Just like that, gone.\n\nThe worst part of it all – aside from the fact that anyone I know could disappear at any moment – is the Sound. Picture a small child, cheeks filled with air, waiting for the unsuspecting parent to doze off. He creeps up, right up close, to their ear and releases the air in a concentrated little *pop*. That's the sound people make when they go. It's the sound I dread most now, more than the whine of a police siren or the cry of a newborn baby. I'd rather hear the immense metallic racket of a car crash than that ghastly little *pop*, but I fear the time for accidents has long since passed. There's simply no one left to have them.\n\nI walk the streets aimlessly, hoping against hope that I'll round the corner and stumble across a familiar face. I turn on the television, but every channel's static. At least it's a reminder that there used to be life, just as each little *pop* is the announcement of someone's death. Wherever I go, the Sound cuts through the silence.\n\nAnd now it's just me, left to carry the torch of humanity for as long as I'm able.\n\nI wonder if I'll hear my own little *pop* when I go.",

Cities lay in ruin, their skyscrapers twisted into grotesque shapes as if molded by giant hands. The air was thick with ash and dust, remnants of a storm that had swept the globe just hours before, altering everything in its path.\n\nIn the small town of Eldridge, Anna stumbled out of her house, blinking against the harsh morning light. Her street was unrecognizable; homes were reduced to piles of rubble, and the old oak that had stood for centuries was uprooted and split in two. The storm, a freak occurrence that scientists had failed to predict, had come with little warning, leaving chaos in its wake.\n\nAnna moved through the debris, calling out for her neighbors, but her voice was swallowed by the eerie silence that enveloped the town. It was as if the storm had not only torn apart the physical world but had also sucked away its life and sound. She found Mr. Thompson sitting dazed on the curb, clutching a photograph of his family, now scattered. Anna touched his shoulder gently, offering what comfort she could.\n\nThe storm had been no ordinary tempest. It was the first of its kind—a global electrical storm that surged with an unknown energy, disrupting the earth's magnetic fields. Technology was rendered useless; machines lay lifeless, screens dark, communication severed. People were left to fend for themselves in this new reality, disconnected like islands in a vast, uncharted sea.\n\nAnna and Mr. Thompson wandered toward the town square, where others had gathered, their faces etched with disbelief and fear. No one knew what had caused the storm or what might come next. But as they shared stories and resources, a fragile hope began to form. Together, they might piece together what was left and find a way to navigate this new apocalypse."

Considering his lawn wasn't much more than a sunbaked square of dirt, and Mr. Mayers was a loudmouth & notoriously shit tipper at Peg's, I considered this incident listed in favor of the greater good. Kids need a domain to call their own, a way to blow off steam.\n\nBut to bludgeon a creature like this...this didn't suit the values of Johnsville at all.\n\nThe bat laid by the animal's side, sticky with its blood, blonde hair clinging in patches as low as the first pass of electrical tape on the handle.

    "MGT": "She was eighteen years old, and she didn't even have a name. The village folk called her many things: \"the girl with the wild eyes,\" \"forest's daughter,\" \"the wanderer.\" She had grown up in the heart of the woods, raised by its whispers and shadows. Her parents had disappeared when she was too young to remember, leaving her with nothing but the trees' murmurs and the moon's gentle gaze.\n\nEvery morning, she awoke to the singing of birds, the rustle of leaves, and the distant roar of the river. She was content, for the forest was her home, and its creatures were her family. But she yearned for something she couldn't quite name—a connection, a sense of belonging beyond the confines of her green world.\n\nOne day, as she wandered through the familiar paths, she heard a distant melody carried on the wind. It was unlike anything the forest had sung to her before. Intrigued, she followed the sound, weaving through the trees with the grace of a deer. As she drew closer, the music grew louder, more defined. It was a song, a human song.\n\nShe stepped into a clearing and found a gathering of people singing and dancing around a crackling fire. Their clothes were bright and colorful, their laughter infectious. She watched from the shadows, mesmerized by the warmth and joy that radiated from them.\n\nA young man noticed her and approached cautiously, his smile gentle and welcoming. \"Hello,\" he said, \"I've never seen you here before. What's your name?\"\n\nShe hesitated, for she had never needed one. But she realized that if she wished to join their world, she must have something to call herself. She glanced at the moon, hanging low and bright in the sky, and whispered, \"Luna.\"\n\nThe young man nodded, \"A beautiful name for a beautiful soul.\"\n\nLuna felt a warmth spread through her, a sense of belonging she had never imagined. She stepped out from the shadows, joining the circle of laughter and song. And for the first time, Luna was no longer just the girl from the forest—she was Luna, a name and a part of something new."

The unemployment checks were enough to cover the first 3 weeks of food, eating sparingly, but the last week of the month was always rough.\n\nTo my astonishment, I found an old set of watercolours and canvases.

It was my last dollar spent, a testament to dwindling options and the cold reality of the present. The streets buzzed with the hum of drones and autonomous vehicles, a symphony of progress that seemed deafeningly indifferent to those it left behind. I sat on a bench in the park, watching people pass by, absorbed in their augmented realities, oblivious to the world around them.\n\nMy thoughts drifted back to the days when I wrote code that felt like magic, lines turning into solutions, creating and innovating. But the machines had learned. They evolved, and my role became redundant. Jobs vanished overnight, swallowed by algorithms more efficient than any human could dream of being. The irony was that we had built the very tools that made us obsolete.\n\nI took a bite of the hamburger, savoring its simplicity, the tang of mustard, the crunch of lettuce. In a world of synthetic foods and hyper-real experiences, there was something grounding about it, a reminder of times past. As I ate, I pondered what was left for me, for people like me who had been pushed to the fringes of a society that raced forward without looking back.\n\nBeside me, an old man sat down, his eyes scanning the park as if searching for an answer hidden in the mundane. He glanced at my burger and smiled, a knowing smile that spoke of shared burdens and unspoken stories. Without a word, he offered me a small, worn book, its pages yellowed and frayed at the edges. \n\n\"What's this?\" I asked.\n\n\"A chance,\" he replied, his voice a whisper of hope. \"To write new code, new stories. For the world still needs dreamers.\"\n\nI accepted the book, feeling the weight of possibility. And in that moment, beneath the shadow of progress, I found a spark of hope."

The cabin crew was still cheerfully recounting safety procedures, oblivious to the dread his words had sewn into my mind. I scrutinized him, searching for any hint of jest or insanity. Instead, I found a steady gaze, unwavering and disturbingly calm.\n\nAs the plane ascended into the clouds, his words refused to leave me.

A young woman named Elara hesitated before stepping forward. She gazed at the spoon, its surface worn smooth by countless hands. \"What does it do?\" she asked, her voice trembling.\n\nThe demon's eyes flickered with a strange light. \"It is a tool,\" it replied cryptically. \"To carve your own path through eternity.\"\n\nElara's gaze shifted to the scroll, shimmering with divine promise. Yet, something in her heart tugged at her, urging her to choose the spoon. She reached out, fingers brushing its worn handle, and felt a surge of resolve.\n\nAs she grasped it tightly, a sense of purpose settled over her. She turned to face the vastness of Hell, a realm of endless suffering, yet now filled with possibilities.

It was a goodbye letter from Sam, her partner for the past six years. The words echoed in her mind: \"I need to find myself.\"\n\nThe salty breeze whipped through her hair, as if trying to comfort her with its gentle embrace. Ella had always loved the ocean. It was where she and Sam had first met, and where they had spent countless sunsets wrapped in each other's arms.

You'll look like a royal prick with your head up someone's ass, yeah, but better that that living the rest of your life with a mouth like a pirate's asshole.\n\nI've learned to live with the cussing, but I'll be god damned if everyone doesn't think they're the reincarnation of Sherlock fucking Holmes when they point it out. Hey, Sherlock, you think I don't fucking know that? That I can't hear the words coming out of my own fucking mouth? I mean Jesus Christ I'm not deaf, just a foulmouthed sonofabitch. I could point out that your clothes would make a flaming gay porn star blush, but I'm not an asshole. Your fashion sense seemed to have decided that the world wasn't worth it and decided to suck the barrel of a gun instead of sucking cock like it used to, but I don't need to say anything because every motherfucker can see it just by looking at you. I mean, fuck, at least I need to open my mouth to look like an idiot, and splattering my head across the fucking pavement is a pretty good reason. What's your excuse, asshole?\n\n\nSo yeah, apparently I swear a fucking lot. Bite me.",
    "MGT": "Growing up in a boisterous family, swearing was as common as breathing. My grandmother would curse at the television when her favorite team was losing, and my father could weave a tapestry of profanities when fixing the car. It was only natural that I followed suit.\n\nI never thought much about it until my best friend, Emily, pointed it out. \"You swear a ****ing lot,\" she said, half-amused, half-concerned. I shrugged it off, thinking it was just part of my personality. But then, I noticed strangers staring at me in cafes, and colleagues raising eyebrows during meetings.\n\nDetermined to change, I started a swear jar. A dollar for every curse word. By the end of the week, it was overflowing like a broke piggy bank, but I was slowly improving. My vocabulary expanded, and I discovered the art of expressing frustration without resorting to expletives.\n\nOne day, Emily laughed, \"You sound like a poet!\" I grinned, realizing that maybe, just maybe, I was becoming one."

    "MGT": "In the quiet town of Willow Creek, nestled between rolling hills and whispering woods, stood a weathered cottage with ivy-clad walls. Inside, in a cozy room adorned with faded floral wallpaper, lived Mrs. Agnes Whittaker, a woman whose years had gracefully etched themselves into the lines of her face. Her days were marked by routines, and her nights were cradled by the gentle symphony of a grandfather clock, its tick-tock a constant companion.\n\nAgnes had lived in the cottage for over five decades. The clock, a gift from her late husband on their wedding day, stood tall and proud in the corner of the living room. Its pendulum swung with a steady rhythm, filling the air with a sound that had become the heartbeat of the house. To Agnes, it was more than just a timekeeper; it was the keeper of memories.\n\nAs she sat in her armchair by the window, knitting needles clicking softly in her hands, the clock's ticking seemed to echo the cadence of her life. Each tick was a reminder of moments shared, laughter exchanged, and the passage of time that had brought both joy and sorrow. It was a comforting presence, a familiar sound that anchored her in a world that felt increasingly unfamiliar.\n\nAgnes's children had long since moved to distant cities, their visits now few and far between. Her friends, once vibrant and full of life, had gradually departed, leaving her with only the clock for company. Yet, she found solace in its steady rhythm, a reminder that time, though relentless, was also a gift.\n\nOne evening, as a gentle rain pattered against the windowpanes, Agnes found herself lost in thought. The clock continued its faithful ticking, and she imagined it telling stories of yesteryears, of dances held in the parlor, and whispered conversations by the fireplace. She closed her eyes, her mind drifting to a time when the house was filled with laughter and the sound of young feet scampering about.\n\nIn the stillness of the room, the clock's ticking wrapped around her like a warm embrace. Agnes smiled softly, her heart full of gratitude for the life she had lived and the memories she cherished. The clock, with its ceaseless rhythm, was her steadfast companion, a reminder that even in solitude, she was never truly alone."

    "HWT": "I unfolded my arms from my chest, feeling blood surge back into them. With painstaking slowness but total silence, I reached up and removed my rucksack from under my neck, wincing as the kinks in my neck twanged and took up the load of my head. I found the tiny, tough thread of fishing line twisted around my belt loop and drew it taught, then gave it a slow pull. There was a dull clank on the other side of the hatchway as the exterior handle was released. Then I pushed against the metallic wall behind and above me, causing the rolling metal tray to whisper along the rails, and my toes rested lightly on the metal door. I gave the lightest of pushes.\n\nLight poured in around the edges of the hatch as it opened a quarter of an inch. Good, it was dawn. I listened intently for a very long moment, but heard nothing: no slither of flesh, drip of bile, clack of bone, or creak of spoiled larynges. Still moving slowly, I slid the tray farther along the rails, causing the hatch to swing open with a muted creaking. I quickly wound my precious length of fishing line around my fingers, watching the knotted loop at the end skitter along the floor as it scampered around the steel table leg I was using as a pulley in my hatch-release system. Then I turned, lowered my legs, and stood, stamping a little to restore circulation as I swung my rucksack back into place on my shoulder. I took a step, then hesitated and turned, pushing the tray back into the recesses of the morgue refrigerator and carefully shutting the hatch. In these times, if you found a safe hiding place, you saved it, in case you had to come back in a hurry.\n\nAs I set out again, I wondered if it was ironic that a morgue drawer would be a safe haven for the living hiding from the undead.",

Confusion washed over me as I tried to move, realizing the tight confines around my body. Panic surged, and I pushed against the smooth surface above, a lid sliding open with a groan.\n\nDim fluorescent lights flickered overhead, casting eerie shadows across the sterile room. I blinked, trying to comprehend the scene before me. A mortuary, its silence pierced only by the hum of refrigeration units. My heart pounded as I sat up, the reality of my situation hitting with chilling clarity—I had awakened in a drawer meant for the dead.\n\nI swung my legs over the edge, the cold tiles sending shivers through my bare feet. Fragments of memory flashed—an accident, blinding lights, then darkness. Yet here I was, alive in a place meant for the deceased.\n\nWith trembling hands, I managed to stand, the surreal atmosphere amplifying every sound, every movement. I took a tentative step, searching for answers, for an escape from this nightmare. A clipboard sat on a nearby counter, a name—my name—scribbled in bold letters under \"John Doe.\"\n\nA door creaked open, a silhouette entering the room. The pathologist froze, eyes wide with disbelief before breaking into a stunned smile. \"You're alive!\" they breathed, their voice a lifeline in this world of shadows."

The spectrum of red determined everything—pale pink for leaders, deep crimson for those less fortunate.\n\nAs I stepped into the dimly lit cavern, the air was thick with whispers of destiny. The cave was alive with an ethereal glow, casting shadows that danced across the stone walls. I approached the altar, heart pounding, and closed my eyes as the Keeper placed the Mask in my hands.\n\nWhen I opened my eyes, the world seemed to tilt. My Mask was not red. It was blue, a color unheard of, a deviation from the sacred order. Gasps echoed around me, a ripple of shock spreading through the crowd. Faces blurred and voices rose, tinged with fear and curiosity.\n\nThe Keeper's voice broke the chaos. “A new path emerges.” With those words, I understood that my journey was different, destined to challenge the norms and redefine our society. The blue Mask was not a curse, but a beacon of change."

She reached with her free hand to stroke his head, tickling him under the beak.\n\n\"Diablo, my love. You, and only you, understand me. I am tired from these years of unyielding search.

There was nothing but silence, the kind that whispered tales of forgotten times and lost souls.\n\nIn the midst of this desolation, there lay a path of tracks, faint yet unmistakable. They were the footprints of a solitary wanderer, etched into the earth with the weight of his journey. They began at the edge of a dried-up riverbed, snaking their way across the barren ground, disappearing into the horizon.\n\nThe tracks belonged to a man long gone, a drifter seeking solace in the quiet embrace of the desert. His name was whispered among the townsfolk, spoken in hushed tones and accompanied by tales of mystery. Some said he was a fugitive, others a pilgrim on a quest for redemption. Yet, none truly knew the story of the man who left those tracks.\n\nAs the sun dipped lower in the sky, casting long shadows over the sand, a lone traveler stumbled upon the tracks. His name was Ethan, a seeker of stories that the world had forgotten. He bent down to examine the footprints, his fingers tracing the outline of each step. There was something hauntingly beautiful about them, a dance of solitude and purpose.\n\nEthan followed the tracks, his mind weaving narratives of the man who had walked this path. He imagined a figure with eyes that held the wisdom of the ages, shoulders burdened with memories, and a heart that beat with the rhythm of the earth. Each step was a testament to resilience, a silent proclamation that life could be carved out even in the harshest of terrains.\n\nAs the day surrendered to night, Ethan felt a profound connection to the tracks, as if he had stumbled upon a fragment of his own soul. He paused, gazing at the stars that now adorned the sky, and whispered a silent prayer for the man who had walked this journey before him. Just a dead man's tracks in the dust, but they told a story of life, of hope, and of a timeless quest for meaning in a world of endless possibilities."

    "HWT": "SORRY IT TURNED A BIT NSFW HOPE THIS IS NO PROBLEM... YOU ARE ADVICED.\n\nNSFW\n\nSure, half a liter of blood is a handsome amount. You feel weak, for hours. But it's worth it, you know?\n\nEvery day now, for about a year and a half, she took. It was good, the feeling to be feeding someone. I imagine a mother feels the same way.\n\nWhen she first did it, I was in shock. But not the way one might think; I was just having the greatest orgasm ever and my whole body froze and strained itself. She clearly took advantage there, but now it really seems that was probably the best way to do it.\n\nLike a mosquito, when sucking blood she would simultaneously ingress small amounts of toxins into my bloodstream. A mix of exotic chemicals that made sure the wounds didn't infect, healed properly and extremely quickly (about an hour or two), and made the bitee experience a feeling of inner peace and euforia, in moderate amounts.\n\nI had always had a mild form of odaxelagnia, like many men do. I always would come the hardest when she would bite my lip or nipple a bit while I worked her pussy.\n\nAnyway, you can think about it what you like, but I'm not giving it up. She says that if I keep doing it, that there's a chance I might become one...\n\nNever as powerful as her tho, but I knew that when I met her first. I'm so proud of my girl!\n\nI would even recommend you to be dating a vamp. You literally do not know what you're missing...\n\nDid I tell you the muscles of her ass (of perfect shape and form, btw) are as hard as rock and still soft and squeezy? She sure is something!",
    "MGT": "The moon hung high, casting its silvery glow over the quiet town, where shadows whispered secrets to those who dared listen. I sat on the porch, the gentle hum of the night settling around me. Beside me, Elara was a vision of serenity, her emerald eyes reflecting the moonlight like twin gems.\n\nIt had been three months since I pieced together the mystery that surrounded her. The signs were subtle—a reluctance to join me for daytime adventures, her uncanny ability to know things she couldn’t possibly have heard. And then, of course, there was the night I found her in the garden, her eyes glowing like embers, her lips stained crimson.\n\nI’d never been one for conventional relationships, and this revelation was just another layer to the tapestry of our love. Elara was a vampire, but it didn’t matter; she was still the same enchanting woman who captured my heart. Her secret was no burden but a bond, a delicate thread that tied us closer. In her presence, I felt alive, more so than ever before. Her world was filled with wonder and ancient tales, a realm where nights stretched into eternity.\n\nShe turned to me, a teasing smile playing on her lips. “You’re not afraid?” she asked, her voice a melodic whisper.\n\n“Afraid?” I chuckled, shaking my head. “Not at all. I’d follow you into the darkest depths if you asked.”\n\nElara leaned in, her breath cool against my skin. “Then we’ll make this night ours.”\n\nAnd so, under the watchful gaze of the stars, we embraced the beautiful unknown, letting it weave into the story of us."

    "HWT": "Sirta had been born under a bad omen. The clan just did what they always had done and threw her over the threshold. The people under a bad omen were a threat and had been put in that magical area were nothing can escape once it gets in. The village was safe in that area, the child not so much. Sirta was fed (the village were not savages, they used to just starve these people, but these days, they even allowed them to survive) and learned to scavage, she was not spoken to, but she learned speech from hearing the others. When she spoke to them, they told each other how horribly inappropriate she had just been.\n\nShe tried to be useful to the village by waking them when the jackals were about to attack at night, and it even led to a bit of appreciation, until once, she confused a group of housecats with jackals. The vllagers even threw stones at her and insulted her. It was the only imes they talked to her so she became more unpleasant and caused more problems by being loud, rude and angry. I relished the attention I got. For the first time I was a presence, not an absence. That is how they call the area beyond the threshold: the Absence.\n\nThese days, I don't even do this, the stones left me bruised for too long. I just gave up. Even when thy gave me positive attention, I kept to myself and instead tried to define myself as myself, not as the area they threw me in as a child. I walked away from the village. Maybe I was not the first one who was thrown in here.",
    "MGT": "The morning sun peeked over the horizon, casting a warm glow over the old oak tree that stood resolute in the center of the meadow. Beneath its sprawling branches, I sat cross-legged, my palms resting on my knees, feeling the gentle caress of the breeze. This was my sanctuary, the place where I confronted the greatest struggle of my life.\n\nYears ago, the meadow was a battlefield of emotions, where I wrestled with the shadows of self-doubt and fear. Each day felt like climbing a mountain with no summit in sight, my burdens weighing me down. The world around me seemed full of opportunities, yet I was paralyzed, imprisoned by my own mind. The oak tree was my silent witness, its roots dug deep into the earth as my own were tangled in uncertainty.\n\nOne evening, as dusk settled, I found myself under the tree's wise canopy, tears streaming down my cheeks. The whispering leaves seemed to offer solace, urging me to look inward. It was then that I realized the power of choice. I could choose to nurture seeds of hope or feed the weeds of despair.\n\nWith renewed determination, I began to untangle the knots within me, slowly but deliberately. The struggle was fierce, but the oak remained steadfast, a symbol of resilience. As the years passed, my inner landscape transformed, much like the meadow in springtime, blossoming with newfound strength and purpose.\n\nNow, as I sit beneath the oak, the shadows have receded, replaced by the light of acceptance. My life’s greatest struggle became the foundation upon which I built a life of meaning and joy, forever intertwined with the wisdom of the ancient tree that watched me grow."
