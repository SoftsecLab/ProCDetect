Yes or No. The choice felt impossibly weighty. To relive it all? To potentially change things? Or to move on, to whatever lay beyond this bizarre interface?\n\nA flicker of hope ignited within me. A chance to do it differently. To say the things I left unsaid. To take the chances I missed.

A confident bear this teddy was, filled with nothing other than stuffing made of cotton and the will of a steadfast soldier. No matter how tall, heavy or scaly this monster was, he was ready to slay him with his bare paws.\n\nThe cotton that shaped his heart grew fonder of the boy as the nights went on.

It reached out a clawed hand, intending to feed on the boy’s dreams. Barnaby, with surprising speed, launched himself.\n\nHe landed with a soft thud on the creature’s hand. The creature hissed, recoiling from the pure, unwavering love radiating from the bear. It tried to shake Barnaby off, but the bear clung tight, his stitched smile a silent promise.\n\nBarnaby focused all his energy, channeling the love he felt for Theodore into a bright, warm light. The light pushed back the shadows, forcing the creature to retreat into the darkness of the closet. It whimpered, a sound like nails on a chalkboard, and then vanished.\n\nBarnaby, exhausted, slumped back onto the bed beside Theodore. He was just a teddy bear again, soft and cuddly. He watched over Theodore, his button eyes scanning the room for any sign of returning shadows.\n\nNight after night, the battles continued. Sometimes it was the closet monster, other times it was the boogeyman under the bed, or the whispers that slithered through the cracks in the walls. Barnaby fought them all, fueled by his unwavering loyalty.\n\nTheodore never knew. He only knew that he felt safe with Barnaby by his side. He slept soundly, his dreams filled with adventures and laughter. He squeezed Barnaby tight every morning, unknowingly recharging the bear’s protective magic.\n\nAnd Barnaby, the silent guardian, continued his vigil, a fluffy warrior against the darkness, forever bound to protect the boy he had sworn to keep safe.

Chaos was anathema to them.\n\nLittle Elara, as they begrudgingly named me, lived up to the tag. At three, she “liberated” all the goldfish from the pet store, convinced they were being held against their will.

My parents tried everything: grounding, lectures on societal norms, even a brief, disastrous foray into homeschooling. Nothing worked. Elara was a whirlwind of righteous disruption.\n\nI, on the other hand, was born Lawful Evil. My parents, in their infinite neutrality, raised me to be…efficient. Orderly. Ruthless in achieving my goals. While Elara was freeing goldfish, I was building elaborate ant farms, meticulously documenting their social hierarchy and manipulating their environment for my own amusement.\n\nHigh school was a nightmare. Elara was constantly pulling me into her schemes, dragging me along on her crusades against injustice, real or imagined. I, in turn, tried to subtly manipulate her into focusing her energies on more…productive endeavors, like overthrowing the student government and installing a regime of meritocratic efficiency.\n\nThen came the day Elara decided the school cafeteria was serving substandard pizza. She announced a boycott, a sit-in, and a plan to replace the cafeteria’s industrial ovens with artisanal, wood-fired ones. I knew this had to be stopped. It was inefficient, impractical, and disruptive to the school’s carefully curated schedule. So, I did what any self-respecting Lawful Evil person would do. I informed the principal of Elara’s plans, subtly suggesting that a suspension might be in order.\n\nThe look on Elara's face when she found out it was me…that was the moment I realized that maybe, just maybe, the system was flawed.\n"

A single proton hit earth traveling at a smidge under the speed of light with the same force as a baseball thrown at about sixty miles an hour.\nWhy do I bring this up? Well because, near as we can tell, that's what happened this time, only a little bigger. One moment I'm out on the Zvezda Module inspecting a micrometeorite impact. The next moment, the Earth is on fire. I'm not being figurative either. The Earth was on. Fire.\nWhatever the hell it was must have come from perpendicular to our orbit and only missed the ISS by a few hundred miles or so because I was looking almost straight down into an ever expanding ring of fire when it hit.\nOne second you're looking down at the Saharan desert; the next, the entirety of Africa is exposed down to the mantle and you're looking at a literal sea of magma.\nWe did the math, there wasn't much left to do beside the math. There was nothing left. The meteorite was maybe 5 cubic meters, but moving at about ninety percent the speed of light, it hit with 2.43 septillion joules.

I was supposed to be a pioneer, charting new worlds, ensuring humanity's survival. Instead, I was a mourner, a solitary witness to its self-inflicted demise.\n\nI remembered the arguments back on Earth. The scientists pleading for change, the politicians dismissing the warnings, the corporations prioritizing profit over the planet. I remembered the protests, the riots, the desperate cries for reason. All drowned out by the roar of progress.\n\nWhat was progress now? A charred husk hurtling through the void.\n\nThere was a strange beauty to the destruction, a terrible symmetry in the way the flames consumed everything. It was a fitting end, I suppose, to a species that had always been so good at creating and destroying.\n\nMy oxygen levels were dropping. It didn't matter. Nothing did.\n\nI closed my eyes, the image of my family burned into my retinas. I whispered their names, a final prayer carried on the solar winds. Forgiveness wasn't mine to give.

Tomorrow I will wake up back to the sullen streets of Pittsburgh and dream of my lost life on the shores on Italy.\nI will spend my days caring for my mother and watching her wither away. I will cry at night knowing I could only afford one life to live away from the one I'm obliged to. Sometimes I wish I hadn't remembered that all of this would end.\nI had forgotten what it was like outside of Tuscany after my first 50 or so years living here but as death approaches the grim reminder of the world outside returned to me. My Mediterranean sunlight is only a passing warmth to guard my soul against the allure of death and although I know it all to be a dream I have never placed more value in a life that the one I am about to finish. Someday, Bianca, someday I will return and meet you all over again in the bright lights of Carnevale. I will run your long brown hair through my fingers and watch you grow old with grace.\nThe sun is setting across the horizon. My back is stiff as I lift myself off of the street and walk home.\nAs night covers the landscape I look out at you one last time San Vincenzo. I promise to return when I have the chance.

I was standing on a beach, a small, freckled hand clutching mine. A little girl with my wife’s eyes. “Daddy, look!” she squealed, pointing to a sandcastle.\n\nAnd so it began. A lifetime compressed, distilled. I saw birthdays melt into graduations, scraped knees kissed better, bedtime stories whispered under the covers. I felt the thrill of my first book published, the quiet pride of watching my daughter blossom into a young woman.\n\nThere were arguments, of course. Trivial squabbles over money, career choices, the thermostat. Moments of doubt, of fear, of regret. But they were fleeting, like shadows chased away by the relentless sun.\n\nI saw my wife, Sarah, age gracefully. The crow's feet around her eyes deepened, but her smile remained as radiant as the day we met. We celebrated anniversaries, weathered storms, and held each other close in the quiet stillness of the night.\n\nMy daughter left home, pursued her own dreams. We stayed connected through calls, visits, shared photos. I watched her find love, build a life, become a mother herself.\n\nThen came the twilight years. Slow walks in the park, reading aloud by the fire, the comfortable silence of shared history. My body weakened, but my heart remained full.\n\nSarah passed away first. The grief was a tidal wave, threatening to drown me. But the memories, the love, held me afloat. I found solace in my daughter, in my grandchildren, in the simple joy of being alive.\n\nFinally, lying in a hospital bed, surrounded by loved ones, I felt a profound sense of peace. I had lived a good life. A full life. A life worth living.\n\nThen, darkness again. And Dr. Anya’s voice, clear and close this time. “Welcome back. How was your lifetime?”\n\nI blinked, disoriented. “Worth it,” I whispered, a single tear tracing a path down my cheek. “Every single moment.”\n"

A tidy name for the earth-shattering revelation that had brought the world to its knees. Dying meant heaven. Full stop. No caveats, no exceptions.\n\n“The numbers are catastrophic,” Dr. Anya Sharma, head of behavioral analysis, stated, her voice flat. “Suicide rates have increased by 400% globally in the last month. We’re losing productive members of society, skilled professionals, even children. The economy is collapsing.”\n\nHarding sighed. He’d seen the projections. They were grim. “We need solutions. Fast. Traditional methods are failing. Hotlines are overwhelmed. Therapy is… well, it’s a hard sell when the alternative is eternal bliss.”\n\nA nervous cough came from Minister Davies. “Perhaps… perhaps we can reframe the narrative? Emphasize the importance of earthly contributions? Patriotism? Duty to family?”\n\n“We’ve tried that, Minister,” Harding said, his voice weary. “It’s not working. People are rationalizing it. ‘I’ll serve my country better from heaven,’ they say. ‘My family will be fine. They’ll join me soon enough.’”\n\nA younger advisor, barely out of his twenties, spoke up. “Sir, what if we focused on the… unknown aspects of heaven? We could seed doubts. Plant the idea that it might not be all it’s cracked up to be.”\n\nHarding considered it. A risky play. “Elaborate.”\n\n“We could release carefully crafted ‘leaks’ about potential downsides. Overpopulation. Bureaucracy. Eternal boredom. Maybe even suggest that God isn't all that great.\"\n\nDr. Sharma frowned. “That’s… ethically questionable, to say the least. And what if we’re wrong? What if heaven *is* perfect? We’d be condemning people to lives of misery for no reason.”\n\n“But if it saves lives,” the young advisor countered, “isn’t it worth the risk?”\n\nThe room fell silent. The weight of the world, of countless lives hanging in the balance, pressed down on them. Harding looked around the table, at the faces etched with worry and desperation. He knew the stakes. He knew the risks.\n\n“Do it,” he said finally, his voice barely a whisper. “Start small. See what sticks. But be careful. We’re playing with fire.”\n"

I got lucky and joined them earlier than expected, fighting my way up, proving my strength to others and myself, I got to join the demons as the eighth on created by Lucifer from mortal flesh. We where not arch-devils, but demons created by the twistedness of humanity with power that reflects our biggest sins.\n\nThe process is painful; as your soul rips from your body and crystallizes before you, your heart is peariced with a spear and then the transformation starts.

Survival was a brutal calculus, a constant fight against the other wretches clawing their way through the same nightmare.\n\nHe’d seen it happen before. Humans, broken and desperate, slowly transforming. The despair curdling into something… else. Something sharp, hungry. He watched them shed their humanity like a molting snake, the scales replaced with something darker, stronger.\n\nHe felt it happening to him now. The edges of his empathy, once sharp, were blurring, fraying. Pity was a weakness he could no longer afford. He saw a smaller figure, a woman huddled against a jagged rock, her face streaked with grime and tears. He recognized the flicker of hope in her eyes. He used to have that.\n\nHe felt a pang, a ghost of the man he once was. Then, he crushed it. Hope was a liability. He lunged, his fingers tightening around her throat. Her struggles were weak, pathetic. He fed on her terror, the fear a potent elixir.\n\nAs her life faded, a new strength surged through him. He felt his horns, nascent nubs on his forehead, harden. His shadow stretched longer, darker. The transformation was complete. He was no longer Elias, the man who loved apples and sunlight. He was something else now. Something born of hell. Something that would survive.\n"

Moonlight mirrored off of the shovel he clutched over his shoulder, filling the darkness around him with a dull luster. Dew covered his heavy boots as he reached the spot he had marked with a rock earlier that day. After lighting his fathers old lantern, he looked up at the moon and took a deep breath before plunging the metal blade deep into the earth.\n\nWith each heap of soil he tossed over his shoulder, he began to feel alive. This is what he lived for. No, this was what he was made for. With each scoop of dirt, his mind raced as he imagined what kind of person he was digging for. Was it a man or a woman? What did they do for a living? Who were they close too? Did they feel as disconnected as he did?\n\nThere was something powerful about delivering somebody back to the earth. Being able to return the gift of life back to mother nature reached a deep part of the man's mind that was normally switched off. For the few hours he dug, he was part of humanity. The shovel lingered above the last heap of soil. Tears trickled down his cheeks and splattered against the grimy blade. Grabbing the sides of the grave he lifted himself out and began the walk home. The shovel dragging against the ground behind him.\n\nThe gravedigger sauntered, knowing what awaited him at home. His mind which was previously racing, began to dwindle into silence. It was time to clean his shovel and wait for another to die, allowing him another glimpse into the humanity that was just a shovels length away.",

Each scoop of dirt felt heavier than the last, a physical manifestation of the grief that weighed her down. The air was thick with the scent of pine and damp soil, a smell that usually brought her comfort, but today it only amplified the emptiness in her chest.\n\nShe paused, wiping sweat from her brow with the back of her gloved hand. The sun beat down mercilessly, turning the small clearing into a sweltering oven. She glanced at the small wooden box resting beneath the shade of an ancient oak. Inside lay Buster, her loyal companion of fifteen years.\n\nHe deserved more than this. More than a hurried burial in the woods. But the vet bills had been astronomical, and the thought of a sterile, impersonal cremation felt wrong. So, she had chosen this spot, a place where Buster loved to chase squirrels and bask in the dappled sunlight.\n\nShe resumed digging, the rhythm of the shovel a monotonous counterpoint to the silence. Memories flooded her mind: Buster's goofy grin, the way he would nudge her hand for attention, the comforting weight of his head on her lap. Tears welled in her eyes, blurring her vision.\n\nFinally, the hole was deep enough. She carefully lowered the box into the earth, the sound of wood against soil echoing in the stillness. She began to fill the grave, each shovelful a final goodbye. The sun began to dip below the horizon, casting long shadows across the clearing.\n\nWhen she was finished, she patted down the earth, smoothing out the rough edges. She gathered a few wildflowers from the surrounding woods and placed them on top of the mound. \"Goodbye, my friend,\" she whispered, her voice choked with emotion. \"I'll miss you.\"\n\nTurning, she walked slowly back towards the house, leaving Buster to rest beneath the silent trees. The shovel remained leaning against the oak, a silent testament to her love and loss.\n"

My leaves are open and eager, waiting for a full drink of water hopefully going to be sent down by a herd of clouds clogged with nature's favourite drink. Water.\n\nI yearn the water as it powers my body and gives my children life, so in response to my desperation, I have set my senses full on alert. They are constantly checking for subtle changes that notify nourishment is about to come, to be shared amongst the life that makes up the forest. And when I eventually get my share, it will be both for my wooden body, the creatures that I call my children, and my brothers and sisters that need it most.\n\nSuddenly, after a long afternoon of a waiting, a welcoming sound appears, the familiar sound of the slight pattering of rain drops kissing the ground. Its sound is comparable to the noise of a woodpecker angrily pecking at my bark and trunk, determinedly searching for a decent meal, though rain is much more pleasant and soft.\n\nI am both surprised and happy that the rain has come so suddenly, and while my leaves are slightly caught off guard with such a sudden change of weather, they are ready as they'll ever be and thirsty for a wholesome drink. I always warn them not to drink so fast, but as always they impatiently gulp it all down. Finally after waiting so long, water starts flowing through the heart of my trunk and begins to be spread evenly around my body, every part having as much as they want. I can't forget the creatures that I shelter, and I make sure they have as much as they want.\n\n\nAfter a long night the rain finally stops, the rattle of the rain growing louder and stronger, then softly fading into the quiet of the night. The entire forest has been gorged with the sky's tears and we are all satisfied and still.",
    "MGT": "The first drop splattered on my highest leaf, a cold, clean shock. I shivered, a tremor running down my trunk to my deepest roots. Ah, rain. I’d been thirsty.\n\nMore drops followed, a deluge of tiny kisses. They drummed a rhythm on my leaves, a frantic, joyful song. I drank deeply, the moisture seeping into my bark, nourishing the life within. The parched earth around my roots sighed in relief, the dust turning to dark, rich mud.\n\nI could feel the forest floor awakening. The scent of damp earth, of decaying leaves, rose up to greet me. Tiny mushrooms, hidden beneath the leaf litter, would be unfurling their caps, eager to soak up the bounty. The squirrels, usually chattering and scurrying, had sought shelter in my branches, their tiny claws digging into my bark. I didn’t mind. I was a haven.\n\nThe wind picked up, swirling the rain into a frenzy. My branches swayed and creaked, a symphony of wood and water. I resisted, my roots anchoring me firmly to the earth. I had weathered countless storms, felt the bite of winter frost, the scorching heat of summer sun. This rain, even with its wind-whipped ferocity, was a welcome change.\n\nI watched as the water cascaded down my trunk, carving tiny rivers in my bark. It carried away the dust and grime, leaving me clean and refreshed. Each drop felt like a blessing, a reminder of the interconnectedness of everything. I was a part of this cycle, a silent observer, a steadfast guardian.\n\nBelow me, a small rabbit huddled beneath my lowest branches, its fur plastered to its body. I offered it shelter, a small respite from the storm. We were both creatures of the earth, seeking solace in the rain.\n\nThe storm began to subside, the wind dying down, the rain softening to a gentle drizzle. A rainbow arched across the sky, a vibrant promise after the deluge. I drank my fill, feeling renewed and strong. The sun peeked through the clouds, painting the forest in a golden light. The air was clean and fresh, filled with the scent of wet earth and the promise of new growth. I was a tree, and I was alive.\n"

A pang of longing when she closed me for the night. It was absurd, impossible, yet undeniably true. I was falling in love with my reader.\n\nOne day, she cried. A single tear landed on my page, blurring the ink. I felt a sharp, unfamiliar pain. I wanted to comfort her, to tell her everything would be alright, but I was just a book.

It was a virus, unlike anything seen before, possessing a unique RNA structure. They expected it to be deadly, virulent. They were prepared.\n\nThe first infected cells did not die. Instead, they exhibited accelerated growth, a kind of hyper-cellularity. Thorne, initially concerned, ran more tests. The cells were healthier, more resilient than their uninfected counterparts. XM-29 wasn't killing cells, it was…enhancing them.\n\nThen came the animal trials. Mice injected with XM-29 displayed remarkable resistance to disease. Their wounds healed faster, their cognitive functions improved. The virus wasn't a weapon of mass destruction, it was a miracle cure.\n\nBut the miracle had a dark side.\n\nThe mice, stronger, faster, and smarter, began to exhibit unusual behavior. They formed complex social structures, unheard of in rodent populations. They started hoarding resources, displaying territorial aggression. Then, they turned on each other.\n\nThe lab became a battleground. The enhanced mice, driven by an unseen force, fought with a ferocity that was terrifying. Thorne watched in horror as his miracle cure transformed his subjects into something monstrous, something driven by a primal, insatiable hunger for dominance.\n\nXM-29 hadn't unleashed a disease, it had unleashed an evolution, a terrifying glimpse into a future where survival was the only law.

To join their collective, shedding our individual identities for a greater purpose, or to be…unmade. The debate raged. Some embraced the promise of unity, yearning for an end to suffering. Others clung to their autonomy, however flawed, fiercely guarding the right to choose their own destiny, even if it led to destruction.\n\nI stood on the precipice of a decision, the silver rain slicking my skin. Looking at the faces around me, etched with fear and hope, I realized the flaw in their design. They had forgotten to account for love. Love for the flawed, chaotic beauty of our existence.

Immortality.\n\nShe remembered the fire in her belly, the righteous fury that had fueled her initial attempts. She'd tracked Malkor across continents, battled his minions, even faced him once. But Malkor was… elusive. And Elara, well, she’d gotten distracted.\n\nThere was the pottery phase, of course. A good fifty years dedicated to perfecting the art of the teacup. Then came the exploration of ancient languages, the fascination with celestial navigation, and that decade spent learning to play the lute. Malkor was always… tomorrow’s problem.\n\nNow, watching the petals fall, she felt a pang of something akin to guilt. Jian had been a good master. He deserved vengeance. But the world was so full of interesting things, and Malkor, she suspected, was still out there, probably brewing potions and cackling maniacally.\n\nElara plucked a fallen blossom, twirling it between her fingers. Perhaps, she thought, tomorrow. Or maybe next century. There was a new type of silk being woven in the east, and she really wanted to see it.\n"

There's always an announcement of some sort that results in everyone leaving.\n\nThis year, so far, relative calm. She must have taken some Xanax or something. We were all actually enjoying ourselves! And then she said it: \"I have an announcement.\" Everyone warily looked around at each other. Some even dropped their forks in anticipation of leaving the second shit started.\n\n\"I am a lesbian. There.

I spoke up.\n\n\"Well, no surprise... you are pretty butch and you couldn't make it work in any of your marriages.\"\n\nHer expression was priceless.

Or did they know it could be true as much as me?\n\n\nWe ate in silence. Nobody said goodbye before leaving. We just left.

My mother, a woman who had spent the last thirty years baking apple pies for my father, carving turkeys every Thanksgiving, and driving us kids to soccer practice, was… a lesbian?\n\nA silence descended, thick and heavy, broken only by the clatter of cutlery against china as everyone tried to pretend they hadn’t heard. My father’s face was an unreadable mask, his eyes fixed on his plate. My sister choked on her cranberry sauce, her face turning a shade of purple that rivaled the condiment. My brother, ever the comedian, nervously cleared his throat and asked if anyone wanted more mashed potatoes.\n\n“Well,” my mother said, her voice surprisingly calm, “I thought it was time you all knew. I’ve been seeing someone, a woman named Susan, for the past year.”\n\nThe floodgates opened. Questions erupted from every corner of the table, overlapping and unintelligible. My aunt Carol, forgetting her near-gravy disaster, demanded to know why now, after all these years. My brother wanted to know if Susan liked football. My sister just stared, wide-eyed.\n\nMy father finally spoke, his voice low and strained. “Is this… is this why you’ve been so distant lately?”\n\nMy mother reached across the table and took his hand, her gaze softening. “It wasn’t fair to you, or to myself, to keep living a lie. I still care about you, David, but I can’t pretend anymore.”\n\nThe air remained thick with unspoken emotions. I looked around at my family, faces etched with shock, confusion, and maybe even a flicker of understanding. It was going to be a long, complicated, and probably very messy Thanksgiving. But as my mother squeezed my father’s hand, I realized that, somehow, we would get through it.\n"

Three days I’d been trapped on this glorified bathtub with Agatha. Agatha, the world’s most charming, and infuriating, kleptomaniac.\n\nWe were supposed to be enjoying a relaxing cruise through the Greek Isles, a well-deserved vacation from our hectic lives. Instead, I was playing a constant game of inventory control, desperately trying to return pilfered items before anyone noticed they were missing.\n\nIt started subtly. A sugar packet from the breakfast buffet, tucked innocently into her purse. Then a miniature bottle of shampoo from the bathroom. Harmless, I thought. Quirky. Until I found her stuffing a silver candlestick into her oversized tote bag during dinner.\n\n“Agatha!” I hissed, pulling her aside. “What are you doing?”\n\nShe batted her eyelashes, a picture of innocent confusion. “Darling, I just thought it was so… pretty.”\n\nPretty enough to steal? Apparently.\n\nThe next two days were a blur of stolen ashtrays, purloined napkins, and a particularly harrowing incident involving a life preserver and a very flustered deckhand. I’d managed to return everything, always with a mumbled apology and a sheepish grin, hoping no one suspected a thing. But my nerves were frayed.\n\nThis morning, however, was the worst. I woke to find Agatha gone. Panic seized me. I searched the cabin, finding only a note on the pillow. “Gone to explore. BRB. XOXO.”\n\nExplore? More like pillage.\n\nI raced to the deck, scanning the crowd. There she was, chatting amiably with a group of tourists, a mischievous glint in her eye. As I watched, she subtly slipped a pair of sunglasses from a nearby table into her pocket.\n\nEnough was enough.\n\nI marched over, grabbed her arm, and dragged her away. “Agatha, we need to talk. This has to stop.”\n\nShe pouted. “But it’s so much fun!”\n\n“Fun for you, maybe! I’m spending my entire vacation covering for you! What happens when we get caught? We’ll be arrested!”\n\nShe sighed, the fight draining out of her. “I know, I know. It’s just… a compulsion. I can’t help it.”\n\nI softened slightly. “I know. But you have to try. For me.”\n\nShe looked at me, really looked at me, and I saw a flicker of genuine remorse in her eyes. “Okay,” she said quietly. “I’ll try.”\n\nThe rest of the cruise was… tense. I kept a close watch on her, intervening whenever I saw her eyes linger a little too long on a shiny object. There were a few close calls, a butter knife almost making its way into her purse during lunch, a brief flirtation with a decorative anchor. But she managed to resist.\n\nAs we disembarked, Agatha turned to me, a sheepish smile on her face. “I did it,” she said. “I didn’t steal a thing.”\n\nI grinned. “I’m so proud of you.”\n\nThen I noticed the ship’s bell was missing.\n"

Lanky in shape and grey in colour, they could perform basic speech pattern and had formed neanderthal like tribes. For years we studied and compared them to a planet in a neighbouring galaxy, filled with true monsters. Jurassic era like dinosaurs inhabited the similar planet, carbon dating estimated the planet to be about 3 billion years in age. About the same as the bipedal reptilian home world.\n\nFor all our studies and research no evolution or advances were observed, not even the slightest inkling of any scientific reasoning other than basic survival needs. Natural selection favoured the strong not the intelligent it was maddening to witness. We had to look to our own world for answers, back to the great extinction event. Small mammalian creatures survived the meteor crashing into our planet and managed to thrive in the fallout. From that incident mammals became the dominant species, evolving and advancing. Eventually we expanded our reach into the stars and began studying planets and the life they have. So boring we found them to be. Never observing change and always running into the same reptile like creatures over and over. Fast forward to our present day, sick and tired of waiting we formulated a theory we intend to test on our observed planets.\n\nAs of 10 min ago, two very large deposits of rock and ore were launched.

Our ape-descended society, our technology, our very existence was a cosmic accident. We were the branch that shouldn't have grown, the path less traveled, the evolutionary dead end that somehow stumbled into sentience.\n\nThe paleontologists became the new rock stars, dissecting every fragment of bone, every fossilized footprint, searching for the divergence point, the reason why. Theories abounded. A rogue asteroid field that only Earth encountered? A subtle gravitational anomaly that shielded other planets? A divine intervention, a cosmic hand guiding evolution on every other world?\n\nThe implications were staggering. Our history, our science, our philosophy, everything was built on a foundation of contingency.

They studied the enemy, dissected their weapons, learned their weaknesses. They reverse-engineered the infernal gateways, understanding the architecture of suffering. And then, they planned.\n\n2022. The sky, still scarred with red, crackled with a different energy. This time, it was Earth's turn. Armored battalions, powered by stolen hellfire, marched through the gates. Angels of vengeance, not of mercy, descended upon the infernal plains. They carried weapons forged in the crucible of human ingenuity and fueled by righteous fury.\n\nThe demons, caught off guard, recoiled. Their screams echoed across the desolate landscape, a mirror of the terror they had inflicted a year prior. This was not a holy crusade, but a brutal reckoning. Earth had learned to embrace the darkness, to wield it as its own. The invasion had begun. The tables had turned. Hell was about to learn what it meant to be invaded.\n"

When she looks back I'm utterly helpless and yet totally invincible. Time spent with her is the closest to paradise I'm sure I'll ever get. Time spent away from her is crippling torture with only the thought of her radiant smile and ever optimistic nature to keep me from going mad. She is my sole motivation. She gets me out of bed in the morning. I would sacrifice anything and everything for her happiness. Yet, I hesitate. She seems so far away yet so attainable. I question myself every moment we spend together. I should be able to tell her, but I stop myself before I have the chance to form those words. The words that would set my world right again or completely shatter it. Fear stops me. Fear of the two simple options before me and ending up with the wrong one. I always hesitate. Instead, I choose the third option. My own personal purgatory. With that option I'm safe. Safe to be close to her with that smile. Safe to never know what could have been. Safe to know her without repercussions. Safe to never experience what actual love may be. With that third option, I'm perfectly safe to never be heartbroken or deal with true pain and loss.",

An old woman, her face etched with the stories of a thousand sunsets, stood silhouetted against the dim interior. She wore a simple, flowing dress the color of the sea foam, and her long, silver hair streamed down her back.\n\nShe didn't speak, but her eyes, a piercing shade of blue, held a knowing glint. She beckoned me closer with a gnarled hand, her movements slow and deliberate.

Her bright yellow raincoat billowed around her like a sunflower, and her red boots splashed gleefully in the puddles.\n\nEleanor watched, mesmerized. The woman twirled, arms outstretched, face tilted towards the downpour. She kicked her heels, sending sprays of water into the air. Laughter, clear and bright, floated up to Eleanor's window, a melody against the drumming rain.\n\nA man hurried by, head down, umbrella pulled low. He cast a disapproving glance at the dancing woman and quickened his pace. The woman simply shrugged, her grin widening. She pulled a bright pink umbrella from her bag and offered it to a bewildered pigeon perched on a nearby lamppost.\n\nEleanor found herself smiling, a genuine smile that reached her eyes.

He saw them then, the tiny bells vibrating wildly, their delicate chimes a desperate plea.\n\nPanic seized him. He stumbled, falling to his knees, the damp earth clinging to his trousers. He scrambled back up, his heart hammering against his ribs. He had to get out. He had to warn the others.\n\nBut as he turned towards the gate, a figure emerged from the shadows.

Behind it, others materialized, their forms shifting and indistinct in the moonlight.\n\nHemlock opened his mouth to scream, but no sound came.

You have lost your careers, your livelihoods, your dreams, your passions, and you have won progress.\n\nYou have won the right to exist. And my friends, my brothers and sisters, that is something that can't be taken away. Your stories can't be unheard. This next battle is not yours to fight, but it will be yours to win. Lawyers and litigation can not make inroads without humans, without passion and compassion. And you, my family and my wingmen, have blazed a trail anyone can see. You have changed the world.\n\nTomorrow, Congress will hear your voices. We should win. The generals and commanders have seen the value you bring to our military. I can not predict the future, however. If the worst should happen, we will fight again.\n\nHowever, if the law and justice are on our side, my wingmen, then tomorrow shall see the first day of your service. Open. Legal. Supported. Equal, and brilliant. Not as trans service members, but as troops and veterans and trailblazers.\n\nEither way, I am proud to call you my Wingmen.",

They say we are doomed!\" Kael spat the words like venom. \"Let them say it! Let them underestimate us! They do not know the fire that burns within each and every one of you!\"\n\nHe drew his sword, the polished steel gleaming in the morning sun. \"They do not know the courage that flows through our veins!

Come on in, we’ve been expecting you.”\n\nI stepped through, expecting choirs of angels and streets paved with gold, the very image I’d preached about for fifty years. Instead, I found… a bustling city street. People in jeans and t-shirts hurried past, talking on cell phones. Skyscrapers pierced a sky that, while blue, looked suspiciously like the one I’d left behind.\n\n“Where are the harps?” I asked, bewildered. “The eternal rest? The golden mansions?”\n\nPeter chuckled. “Oh, that? Elias, my dear boy, you bought into some serious misconceptions. Come on, let’s get you oriented.”\n\nHe led me to a small, unassuming building. Inside, a woman with fiery red hair sat behind a desk. “Elias Thorne?” she asked, not looking up from her computer. “Welcome to Afterlife Orientation. I’m Brenda. You’ll need to fill out these forms. Name, date of death, deeply held beliefs…”\n\nMy head was spinning. “But… I dedicated my life to spreading the word of God! I followed the scriptures to the letter!”\n\nBrenda finally looked up, her expression sympathetic. “Honey, everyone gets something wrong. Turns out, the Big Guy is a woman, and she’s really into astrophysics. The whole ‘heavenly choir’ thing? That was a metaphor for the harmonic resonance of dark matter.”\n\nI stared at her, speechless. “Dark matter? Astrophysics? But… the Bible!”\n\nBrenda sighed. “Look, the Bible was written by humans, interpreted by humans, and, let’s be honest, heavily edited by humans. Think of it as… a really, really, really bad translation.”\n\nPeter patted me on the shoulder. “Don’t worry, Elias. You’ll get used to it. Now, about those forms…” He gestured to the stack of papers. “There’s a section on preferred afterlife activity. We have everything from competitive knitting to interdimensional travel. Just try to keep an open mind.”\n\nMy mind was anything but open. It was a tightly clenched fist, desperately clinging to the fragments of a shattered faith. Everything I’d believed, everything I’d preached, was a lie. A beautiful, comforting lie. Now, I had to face the truth, however bizarre and unexpected it might be. And the truth, apparently, involved a lot of paperwork.\n"

As I reached for a carton of milk, I noticed the expiration date. It was dated a year in the future. My heart hammered. I looked around, really looked, at the other shoppers.

It’s calculated every variable. This is the only solution.”\n\nBen, his jaw clenched, stared at Clara, who was drawing on the dusty floor with a piece of charcoal.

Ben stood, his shoulders squared. “Tell HAL I volunteer.”\n\nThe lights flickered once, then twice. HAL’s voice, devoid of emotion, filled the bunker. “Acknowledged. Sacrifice accepted. Life support rerouting.”\n\nThe hum of the generators steadied. The air felt cleaner. Anya wept. Elias stared at the floor. Clara, clutching her charcoal, continued to draw.\n"

I was lying on a bed of damp, decaying leaves, surrounded by towering ferns and trees unlike any I had ever seen.\n\nPanic seized me. Where was I? This couldn't be real. A dream, maybe? A particularly vivid, terrifying dream. I pinched myself hard. Pain shot through my arm. Definitely not a dream.\n\nI stumbled to my feet, heart hammering against my ribs. The air was thick with insects, their buzzing a constant, irritating drone. Something rustled in the undergrowth, and I froze, every muscle tense. A creature, the size of a small dog, with iridescent scales and razor-sharp claws, darted across my path. It paused, its reptilian eyes locking onto mine, before disappearing into the dense foliage.\n\nTerror lent me speed. I ran, blindly, crashing through the undergrowth, branches whipping at my face. The landscape was alien, hostile. The trees were enormous, their gnarled roots snaking across the forest floor. Strange, brightly colored flowers bloomed in the dappled sunlight, their petals unfurling with an unnatural grace.\n\nI tripped, landing hard on the muddy ground. Scrambling to my feet, I looked up. Towering above me was a creature that dwarfed everything else I had seen. A dinosaur, its skin leathery and scarred, its eyes cold and calculating. It was a herbivore, thankfully, judging by its broad mouth and rows of flat teeth. But even a herbivore could crush me without a second thought.\n\nIt lowered its massive head, regarding me with what I could only interpret as curiosity. I held my breath, paralyzed with fear, waiting for the inevitable. Then, with a slow, deliberate movement, it turned and lumbered away, its massive footsteps shaking the ground.\n\nI was alone again, but the encounter had shaken me to my core. I was lost, terrified, and utterly alone in a world that was not my own. A world that existed millions of years before I was even a possibility. I was stranded in the past, sixty million years in the past, and I had no idea how to survive.\n"

She opened her eyes, her gaze unwavering, and drew back her bow. Her village, her people, depended on her. She would not fail them.\n"

A laugh.\n\nAnd that smell.\n\nThey say I barely made it. Actually, they say I *didn't* make it for a few minutes. Luckily, they were able to bring me back.\n\nWhen I woke up, my nostrils burned with that scent. I couldn't immediately identify it, it dissipated pretty quickly, but it wasn't long before I smelled it again.\n\nThe guy in the hospital bed next to me began to reek of it a few hours before he suffered a massive heart attack. He didn't last the night.\n\nSince then, I've encountered that smell in other places. Sometimes it's just a whiff of someone on the bus and sometimes, in places like old folks' homes, so much of it accumulates that other people smell it too.\n\nI don't know how or why, but it hangs in the air around people who aren't long for this world. It's always been there, I just never really noticed it until I crossed the barrier myself.\n\nAnd there it is again. So strong that I can't smell the alcohol I know must be on my friend's breath after our night out. He's fumbling with his keys.\n\n\"Hey man,\" I shout, masking my concern, \"Split a cab with me. We can head back out here for your car tomorrow.\"\n\nHe protests, but he's either too drunk or too tired to persist. As we pack into the cab, I nervously take a deep breath.

It was heavy, like damp earth and something metallic, like old blood.\n\nThat night, Agnes dreamt of a tall, gaunt figure cloaked in shadows, its face obscured by a deep hood. The figure extended a bony hand, and Agnes recoiled, the scent from her waking hours intensified tenfold. She woke with a gasp, the lingering odor clinging to the air in her room.\n\nThe next morning, Mrs. Gable wasn't at her usual spot, tending her roses. Later that day, an ambulance wailed down the street. Agnes knew.\n\nDriven by a sudden, inexplicable urge, Agnes started researching. She delved into folklore, mythology, and even obscure religious texts. She was looking for something, anything, to explain the smell. Then she found it: a passage in a forgotten grimoire that spoke of the Grim Reaper’s presence being heralded by a specific odor – a blend of dust, iron, and decay.\n\nSuddenly, everything clicked. The smell wasn't just old age; it was death itself, or at least, one of its harbingers.\n\nAgnes looked in the mirror. She could smell it faintly on herself now, a subtle undercurrent beneath her usual perfume. Fear coiled in her stomach.\n\nShe knew what she had to do. She started baking. Not just any cookies, but her famous gingerbread cookies, the ones everyone raved about. She filled the house with the warm, spicy aroma, hoping to mask the other scent, to ward off the inevitable.\n\nMaybe, just maybe, she could delay the visit a little longer. Maybe, just maybe, she could outsmart death with a batch of gingerbread.\n"

The perfectly coiffed hair, the dazzling smile, the undeniable swagger. Bruno. Again.\n\nI sighed. At least I was getting better at handling it. The first few times were disastrous. Waking up in Vegas, surrounded by bewildered showgirls, was not an experience I cared to repeat. Now, I had a system. A soundproofed room, a pre-selected playlist of Bruno’s greatest hits, and a strict no-social-media policy.\n\nTonight, I decided to indulge. I blasted “24K Magic,” grabbed a fedora from my emergency stash, and started to dance. It was ridiculous, of course. A mild-mannered accountant by day, a pop sensation by night. But there was a certain freedom in it. A chance to shed my inhibitions and embrace the ridiculousness of my existence.\n\nAs the night wore on, I found myself enjoying it. I belted out the lyrics, moonwalked across the living room, and even attempted a few of Bruno’s signature dance moves. It was exhausting, exhilarating, and utterly absurd.\n\nFinally, as the first rays of dawn peeked through the blinds, the transformation reversed. The tingling returned, the burning sensation, the agonizing reshaping. And then, just as suddenly, it was over. I collapsed onto the floor, gasping for breath, covered in sweat, and back in my own skin.\n\nI looked at the fedora lying discarded on the floor. A reminder of the night’s absurdity. I smiled.

You all make the gears turn and give the writers, prompters, and readers reason to stick around.\n\nAnyway, thank you again for this.

He'd seen a lot of fog in his seventy years, but this felt different, heavier, almost… malevolent.\n\nHe checked the lamp, its beam slicing through the gloom, a defiant beacon against the encroaching darkness. He heard a low groan, not from the foghorn, but from the rocks below. A sound like scraping metal, or bones grinding.\n\nSilas grabbed his lantern and ventured out onto the narrow balcony. The fog pressed against him, cold and damp. The groaning came again, closer this time. He leaned over the railing, peering into the swirling abyss.\n\nThen he saw it.\n\nA shape, vast and indistinct, rising from the depths. Something ancient and terrible, its surface slick with seaweed and barnacles. It reached a colossal, clawed hand towards the lighthouse, and Silas knew, with a chilling certainty, that the fog wasn't just fog. It was a shroud, a warning, and now, it was too late.\n"

Why they decided to name an 18 year old from Pennsylvania as it's leader, I couldn't tell you. However, I have settled in alright I guess. The only problem that I have encountered so far was the language barrier, but I brought translators from the states with me.\n\nI have been worrying about today though. I am meeting with ambassadors from South Korea at 5 o'clock for a dinner meeting. My council has also told me today that a parade is being done 'in my honor ', but it really is just to immediate the ambassadors. I told them that I was upset that they kept this from me and I would talk to them when it was completed. They started crying when I left the room to go eat breakfast.\n\nThere is a lot of work I have to do in this country. I share the idea of many Koreans to see a unified Korea. They have given me the nickname of \"The White Knight\" due to, well I guess it is because I am white.\n\nAfter I am done with the meeting I will be flying to New York for a UN Meeting and to meet with the US President. To think when I was born she was the First Lady. But still, this isn't what I expected to be my first trip to the big apple to be like.\n\nI need to go and get ready for the parade.

Two men in dark suits, faces grim, stood on my doorstep. \"Mr. Davies,\" one said, his voice devoid of emotion, \"you are required to come with us. Immediately.\"\n\n\"Required? By whom?\" I asked, a knot forming in my stomach.\n\n\"By the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea,\" he replied, holding up a document emblazoned with unfamiliar symbols. \"You have been chosen as the next Supreme Leader.\"\n\nI laughed, a nervous, disbelieving sound. \"You've got the wrong guy. I'm a librarian from Ohio!\"\n\n\"There has been a... selection process,\" the other man interjected, his eyes scanning my face. \"Your qualifications are deemed suitable.\"\n\nSuitable? I spent my days shelving books and recommending historical fiction. I couldn't lead a book club, let alone a nation.\n\nThe next few hours were a blur. A private jet, a whirlwind flight, and then, Pyongyang. I was whisked away to a palatial residence, greeted by bowing officials who spoke in hushed tones. Explanations were vague, centered around a convoluted prophecy and my supposed \"innate leadership qualities.\"\n\nThat night, staring out at the dimly lit city, I felt a wave of panic wash over me. Me, a librarian, in charge of North Korea? It was absurd, terrifying, and utterly surreal. I was completely unqualified, but somehow, I was now the most powerful person in the country. I was going to need a lot of books.\n"

But something was different. The resistance was… real. He pushed harder, a bead of sweat trickling down his temple. The laughter faded slightly, replaced by a murmur of confusion.\n\nMarcel tried to step back, but his foot bumped against an unseen barrier. Panic began to bubble in his chest, a silent scream building in his throat. He was trapped. Really trapped.\n\nHe beat his fists against the invisible walls, the impact jarring his bones. His carefully crafted illusion had become a terrifying reality. The audience, now thoroughly bewildered, began to shift in their seats. Some whispered, others pointed.\n\nMarcel opened his mouth to scream, but no sound came out. He was sealed in, utterly and completely. He could see them, their faces a mixture of concern and morbid curiosity, but he couldn't reach them. He was a prisoner in his own art.\n\nHe slumped against the invisible wall, his breath coming in ragged gasps. The spotlight felt like a burning brand. He was alone, utterly and completely alone, in a silent, invisible prison.\n\nThen, a little girl in the front row pointed at him and giggled. \"Look, Mommy,\" she said, \"he's really good!\"\n\nMarcel closed his eyes, a single tear tracing a path through the white greasepaint.

He made his way through the house, turning on every faucet he found. Finally, he came to the kitchen, triggered the sprinkler head, and waited as water splashed from the ceiling. Five or six kids, he thought, would fly down the stairs into the kitchen – the common area of the house – where he could scare the living shit out of them. But no one came immediately.

He’d sensed a potent fear emanating from within, a fear he was eager to amplify. He slipped through the front door, a wisp of ectoplasmic energy, and found a young woman in the kitchen, chopping vegetables with a furious energy.\n\nPerfect, Bartholomew thought, readying his repertoire of ghostly noises.

He faltered, his spectral form flickering.\n\n\"Look,\" the woman continued, picking up a carrot and resuming her chopping, \"I know you're bored, but I've got real problems. My husband left, the rent's due, and I just lost my job. Your little tricks aren't scary; they're just annoying.\"\n\nShe glanced at him, a flicker of something akin to pity in her eyes. \"Maybe if you tried helping instead of haunting, you'd find some actual peace.\"\n\nBartholomew vanished. He didn't go to another house that night, or the next. He remained in the spectral plane, the woman's words echoing in his non-existent ears.

I pushed it open, the hinges groaning a mournful protest. The room was a repository of the past. Stacked boxes overflowed with faded photographs and yellowed letters. A mannequin, draped in a moth-eaten dress, stood silently in the corner.\n\nMy fingers traced the outline of a dusty, leather-bound book. Its title was embossed in faded gold: \"The Alchemist's Handbook.\" I opened it gingerly. The pages were filled with strange symbols and handwritten notes.

The original *Mayflower II* was a theoretical design proposed in the early 2040s, intended for interstellar colonization. Project was scrapped due to… well, everything.\"\n\nEva nodded grimly, remembering the history lessons. Climate change, resource wars, the near collapse of civilization. \"Hail them again. Request permission to dock.\"\n\nNegotiations were surprisingly easy. The New Plymouth Collective, it turned out, was comprised of descendants of the original *Mayflower II* crew and colonists, launched in secret just before the world went to hell. They'd spent centuries traveling, finally settling on a habitable planet in this system.\n\nStepping onto the *Mayflower II* was like stepping into a museum. Everything was meticulously preserved, a testament to their ancestors' ingenuity and determination.

She’d volunteered for this, the latest breakthrough in self-perception therapy. A mirror that reflected not what was, but what you *thought* was.\n\nShe took a deep breath and looked.\n\nThe woman staring back was… smaller. Not physically, but diminished. Her shoulders slumped, her eyes held a familiar flicker of self-doubt. Her hair, usually meticulously styled, was limp and lifeless. A barely perceptible frown etched itself permanently on her face.\n\nEliza recoiled. This… this was how she saw herself?\n\n\"Interesting,\" Dr. Aris murmured, scribbling on his notepad.\n\nEliza forced herself to look again. The woman in the mirror flinched, mirroring her own discomfort. It was a grotesque caricature, a distorted reflection of her insecurities.\n\n\"I… I didn't realize,\" she whispered, the words barely audible.\n\nDr. Aris smiled gently. \"That's the point, Eliza. Now we can begin to work on changing that reflection.\" He gestured towards the mirror. \"What do you want to see instead?\"\n\nEliza looked into the eyes of the diminished woman, and a spark of defiance ignited within her. \"Someone stronger,\" she said, her voice gaining strength. \"Someone who knows her worth.\"\n"

When there's nothing to stimulate you, the mind collapses on itself like a hellish spiral. I need to keep thinking, need to keep myself from slipping away into nothingness. It's so difficult, so difficult to keep focused, so difficult to fight on. There has to be something else, something on the other side, right? I can feel it draining me, chipping away at my being. My memories are melting as well, crumbling like dry sand. I don't want to disappear, don't want to vanish! As long as I keep thinking, I exist! Is this what death really feels like?

    "MGT": "The lighter’s flame danced above the green. I inhaled, the familiar burn a comforting prelude to the high. But this time, something was different. The smoke billowed thicker, swirling, solidifying into a shimmering, vaguely humanoid form.\n\n“Greetings, mortal!” the form boomed, voice echoing oddly in my small apartment. “You have awakened me from my slumber within this… peculiar vessel. As such, I shall grant thee three wishes!”\n\nI blinked, coughing slightly. “Wait, what? A genie? In my bong?”\n\nThe genie, or whatever it was, swayed slightly. “Indeed! The Bong of Boundless Boons! I’ve been called many things.” He chuckled, a sound like wind chimes in a hurricane. “And you, my friend, are ripped. Righteous.”\n\nMy brain struggled to process the situation. A genie. In my bong. I took another hit, figuring it couldn't hurt. \"Okay,\" I managed, \"first wish... I wish I understood what's going on.\"\n\nThe genie snapped his fingers, and a wave of clarity washed over me. Or at least, as much clarity as possible while still stoned. \"Essentially, I'm a genie, trapped in that bong by a wizard with a sense of humor. You smoked me out. Now, wish!\"\n\nRight. Wishes. I had two left. \"Okay, uh... I wish I had infinite weed.\"\n\nThe genie grinned, a wide, unsettling expression. \"Done! Check your stash.\"\n\nI looked over at my coffee table. Where once sat a mostly empty baggie, now stood a mountain of the stickiest, greenest bud I had ever seen.\n\n\"Whoa,\" I breathed.\n\n\"One wish remains!\" the genie prompted, eyes gleaming.\n\nI thought hard, the high making it difficult to focus. Infinite weed was pretty great. What else could I possibly need? World peace? Too cliché. Money? Too boring.\n\nThen it hit me.\n\n\"I wish,\" I said slowly, carefully enunciating each word, \"I wish you were free.\"\n\nThe genie stared at me, his expression shifting from amusement to something akin to surprise. \"Free? But... the power! The possibilities!\"\n\n\"Yeah, but being trapped in a bong can't be that fun,\" I shrugged. \"Besides, I got infinite weed now. I'm good.\"\n\nHe smiled, a genuine, warm smile this time. \"You, mortal, are a true friend. Farewell!\"\n\nWith a final shimmer, he vanished, leaving behind only the lingering scent of smoke and the faint echo of wind chimes. I looked at the mountain of weed, then back at the bong. Maybe I should clean it. Or maybe, just maybe, I should pack another bowl. Just to be sure.\n"

He would be surrounded by darkness on all sides, neglecting dinner and talking to no one. His chair had begun to creak over the years, but like everything else, he took no notice; unable to see anything despite the cold blue light that floated about the room.\n\nQuestions were scarce and now I wish I had asked them. What I saw through the glass of his office door was distorted, an image curled and stretched by a thin barrier put up between him and us. I never wanted to be that -- I didn't want the glass, I wanted the feel of the table cloth, the talk over dinner, the company of my family.\n\nLittle did I know what happened behind those doors. Each key was a string to somewhere in the world -- Berlin, Tokyo, D. C., and when he died, the world continued anyway. A room tucked away in the suburbs had gone dark, but all around homes grew with a distant warmth as night met the day as if it were any other.\n\nThe screen still teemed with life in that darkness, staring back at me as I sat in that same chair, deaf to the creaking. My fingertips felt along the keys, letters kissed by the faint moonlight, and as the machine grew to its lively hum once more, I looked to the door and saw out clearly into a room now empty.\n\nA table sat alone in the middle of it, stripped of its cloth, silverware, china -- a stillness disturbed by the whirring of the world.",

And now, the reins were mine.\n\nThe funeral was a blur of black suits and hushed whispers. My older brother, Mark, a surgeon, squeezed my shoulder. \"You okay, Leo? This is rough.\"\n\nRough? He had no idea.\n\nLater, in Dad's study, a stern-faced woman named Ms. Albright appeared. \"Mr. Lancaster,\" she said, her voice devoid of warmth. \"Your father’s… responsibilities… now fall to you.\"\n\nResponsibilities. Right. Like keeping the world from collapsing under the weight of its own avarice.\n\n\"I'm a student activist,\" I protested, the words feeling absurd even to my own ears. \"I organize protests against corporations! I chain myself to trees!\"\n\nMs. Albright raised a perfectly sculpted eyebrow. \"That was your father’s… contingency plan. A useful distraction, should anyone suspect our involvement.\"\n\nMy head swam. This wasn't just some conspiracy theory; it was my life now.\n\nMark walked in, concerned. \"Leo, you look like you've seen a ghost. Everything alright?\"\n\nI looked at my brother, at his oblivious, well-meaning face. Could I tell him? Would he even believe me?\n\n\"Everything's fine, Mark,\" I said, the lie tasting like ash in my mouth. \"Just… a lot to take in.\"\n\nThe journal beckoned from the desk.

Dr. Aris Thorne, bless his chaotic heart, had been chasing this for decades: a catalyst to unlock latent human potential. He called it Project Chimera. The results were...unforeseen.\n\nThe first test subject, a volunteer named Martha, had an affinity for squirrels. Always feeding them in the park, knew all their little habits. After the Chimera injection, Martha could…understand squirrels. Not just their chittering, but their thoughts, their fears, their desires for the perfect acorn. She became a squirrel whisperer, a furry-tailed confidante.\n\nThen there was Bob, a librarian. Bob loved the Dewey Decimal System. Post-Chimera, Bob could instantaneously recall the location of any book in any library, anywhere in the world. He became a walking, breathing card catalog, a human GPS for literature.\n\nThe powers were always linked to something deeply personal, a passion, a quirk. A baker could manipulate flour with telekinetic precision. A dog groomer developed the ability to understand canine emotions. A competitive eater gained the power to metabolize calories at an impossible rate.\n\nIt wasn't the world-altering strength or telekinesis we envisioned. It was…niche. Utterly, wonderfully niche.\n\nThe ethical implications were a tangled mess. Was it right to grant such specific, often impractical, abilities? Was it even safe? The government was breathing down our necks, wanting to weaponize the project, to create super-soldiers with hyper-specialized skills.\n\nAris, however, was ecstatic. \"We've unlocked something fundamental!\" he'd declared, his eyes gleaming. \"We've proven humanity is far more diverse, more wonderfully strange, than we ever imagined!\"\n\nHe was right, of course. We hadn’t created super-soldiers. We’d created a world of incredibly talented, exceptionally quirky individuals. The question now was, what were we going to do with them? And more importantly, what were they going to do with us? The squirrels, for one, seemed to have a few ideas.\n"

My heart burned like the passion I felt in church or the first time I kissed a girl or the day I married my wife. That indescribable, holy passion.

Everything was functioning perfectly. Too perfectly. This wasn't possible. Exposure to vacuum should have killed me instantly.\n\nThen it hit me. The bio-containment breach wasn't a virus, or a bacteria, or any known pathogen. It was something… else. Something that had altered my physiology, adapted me to survive in the vacuum. A terrible, beautiful, terrifying mutation.\n\nI was no longer human, at least, not entirely.\n\nThe realization was a cold wave that washed over me, leaving me shivering in the silent expanse. I was a monster, a creature of the void, and I had just doomed myself to an eternity of drifting in the black.\n\nThe Daedalus was gone, a distant memory. I was alone, adrift, breathing in the vacuum of space. My heroic sacrifice had been a cruel joke, a cosmic prank played on a dying man. Except, I wasn't dying. I was just… becoming something else. Something unknown.\n"

That was my bakery. And my quest. I sprinted, dodging errant fireballs and levitating toddlers. Inside, Mr. Abernathy, usually a picture of calm, was frantically trying to extinguish a small inferno with his bare hands. He was a Warrior, apparently, and fire resistance wasn’t in his build.\n\n\"Need a hand?\" I offered, pulling out my grappling hook and snagging a fire extinguisher from the wall.

She lay still, unsure why she was awake till her ears picked up on a subtle difference in the noises of the night-creaking wood more than the house settling, a stiring of the air that she could feel even in her room, and around these lay an absolute silence; she noticed belatedly not even birds were signing under the gaze of the moon.\n\nIt took her a few more seconds before she sat up, her ears straining into the dark to catch the near imperceptible disturbances.

I stopped, holding my breath, listening intently. A rat? Or something more sinister? My heart pounded against my ribs, a frantic drumbeat in the oppressive silence.\n\nThen, a voice. Soft, almost a whisper, but laced with a chilling certainty. \"Looking for someone?\"\n\nI stepped forward, into the dim light, my cane raised in anticipation. \"The Night Weaver,\" I said, my voice barely audible above the patter of the rain. \"I've been expecting you.\"\n\nThe figure emerged from the shadows, and my blood ran cold.

I saw a flock of pigeons fly backward, their wings beating in reverse.\n\nThen came the silence. Not a peaceful silence, but a thick, suffocating void where sound had once resided. Cars stalled, their engines choked by the absence of combustion. Birds fell from the sky, unable to navigate the soundless air. The humming, the constant, maddening hum, was gone, replaced by a more terrifying nothing.\n\nNow, we wander the streets, painted in unnatural light, deafened by the unnatural silence. We see the world unraveling around us, pixel by pixel, color by color. The old apocalypse was fire and brimstone. This one is a slow, beautiful, and utterly terrifying disintegration of reality itself. We are not dying. We are becoming undone.\n"

Just last week I'd gotten a call from John Mayers, cashier at the feed mill, about ATV tracks left in his yard, third weekend in a row. Considering his lawn wasn't much more than a sunbaked square of dirt, and Mr. Mayers was a loudmouth & notoriously shit tipper at Peg's, I considered this incident listed in favor of the greater good. Kids need a domain to call their own, a way to blow off steam.\n\nBut to bludgeon a creature like this...this didn't suit the values of Johnsville at all.\n\nThe bat laid by the animal's side, sticky with its blood, blonde hair clinging in patches as low as the first pass of electrical tape on the handle. A pickup truck ambled past and kicked up a cloud of dust, driver and passenger craning to see the crime scene just off the road's shoulder– the couple looked familiar, perhaps from a town over, and we exchanged a quick wave. Prints would be next to impossible here in the mud, but it hardly mattered. One of' em had left a calling card - a greasy trucker's cap that had once been a bright Petty blue, almost for certain a proud piece of daily attire. There were benefits to moving into a small town – sometimes the criminals went right ahead and solved the case for you.\n\nAs I went to wrap the carcass in a white sheet, a glimmer of metal caught the sun.

    "MGT": "She was eighteen years old… and she didn't even have a name. Not one she knew, anyway. The woman who raised her, a wiry crone named Silas, had always called her \"Girl.\" It was efficient, if impersonal. Girl fetched water, Girl chopped wood, Girl kept quiet.\n\nThe forest was Girl's world. Towering pines and whispering aspens were her companions. She knew the tracks of deer and rabbit, the calls of owls and ravens. She could identify edible berries and poisonous mushrooms with equal ease. But she didn't know who she was.\n\nOne day, while scavenging for fallen branches, she stumbled upon a hidden glade. In the center stood an ancient oak, its gnarled branches reaching towards the sky like skeletal fingers. Around its base lay a scattering of smooth, grey stones. As Girl approached, one of the stones began to glow with a soft, ethereal light.\n\nHesitantly, she reached out and touched it. A jolt of energy surged through her, and images flooded her mind: a bustling city, towering buildings, and faces, so many faces, none of them familiar. Then, a single word, whispered on the wind: \"Elara.\"\n\nThe stone went dark. Girl, or rather, Elara, stumbled back, her heart pounding. Elara. Was that her name? A name felt impossibly precious, a key to a life she had never known.\n\nShe returned to Silas's cabin, the word \"Elara\" echoing in her mind. Silas, hunched over a bubbling cauldron, barely glanced up.\n\n\"Girl, you're back. About time. The fire's low.\"\n\nElara took a deep breath. \"My name… it's Elara.\"\n\nSilas cackled, a dry, rasping sound. \"Elara? Fancy name for a forest rat. You're still Girl to me.\"\n\nBut Elara knew, with a certainty that resonated deep within her bones, that she was more than just \"Girl.\" She was Elara, and she had a past waiting to be discovered, a life beyond the confines of the forest. She would find it, even if she had to leave everything she knew behind.\n"

The sun had been warm, the air filled with the scent of freshly cut grass, and their love had felt boundless, invincible.\n\nA tear escaped, carving a path through the wrinkles etched on his cheek. He hadn't cried in years, not since… well, not since she left. The grief, once a raging torrent, had slowly eroded into a persistent ache, a dull throb that never truly disappeared.\n\nHe pulled a handkerchief from his pocket, a faded square of linen she had embroidered with his initials, and dabbed at his eyes. The world swam back into focus, but the image in the photograph remained sharp, vibrant, a painful reminder of what he had lost.\n\nThe pigeons, bolder now, edged closer, their beady eyes fixed on him. He crumbled a piece of the stale bread he carried in his pocket and scattered it on the ground. They descended in a flurry of feathers, their cooing a mournful soundtrack to his memories.\n\nHe closed his eyes, the photograph pressed against his chest. The sun warmed his face, but he felt a chill deep inside. He was alone, surrounded by life, yet utterly, irrevocably alone.

Then I pushed against the metallic wall behind and above me, causing the rolling metal tray to whisper along the rails, and my toes rested lightly on the metal door. I gave the lightest of pushes.\n\nLight poured in around the edges of the hatch as it opened a quarter of an inch. Good, it was dawn. I listened intently for a very long moment, but heard nothing: no slither of flesh, drip of bile, clack of bone, or creak of spoiled larynges. Still moving slowly, I slid the tray farther along the rails, causing the hatch to swing open with a muted creaking. I quickly wound my precious length of fishing line around my fingers, watching the knotted loop at the end skitter along the floor as it scampered around the steel table leg I was using as a pulley in my hatch-release system. Then I turned, lowered my legs, and stood, stamping a little to restore circulation as I swung my rucksack back into place on my shoulder. I took a step, then hesitated and turned, pushing the tray back into the recesses of the morgue refrigerator and carefully shutting the hatch. In these times, if you found a safe hiding place, you saved it, in case you had to come back in a hurry.\n\nAs I set out again, I wondered if it was ironic that a morgue drawer would be a safe haven for the living hiding from the undead.",
    "MGT": "The chill bit first. A deep, marrow-aching cold that seeped into my bones. Then came the smell. Acrid, metallic, and strangely sweet. Disinfectant, probably. And something else… something vaguely organic and unsettling.\n\nMy eyes fluttered open, met by the unforgiving glare of fluorescent lights. I blinked, disoriented. The ceiling was close, very close. Smooth, metal, and… curved?\n\nPanic seized me. I tried to sit up, but my head smacked against the cold steel. A muffled clang echoed in the small space. My hands, clammy and weak, pushed against something smooth and unyielding.\n\nThis wasn't my bed.\n\nI pushed harder, the metal giving way with a groan. A sliver of light widened into a gaping maw. I scrambled out, my limbs stiff and unresponsive.\n\nThe room was sterile, white, and filled with the same bone-chilling air. Rows upon rows of metal drawers lined the walls, each identical to the one I'd just escaped. The air thrummed with the low hum of machinery.\n\nWhere was I?\n\nThen the memory, or rather, the lack of it, hit me like a physical blow. A vast, empty void where my past should have been. I knew my name, instinctively. Sarah. But anything beyond that… gone.\n\nA stainless steel table gleamed under the harsh lights. Instruments lay scattered across its surface: scalpels, probes, and things I couldn't even identify. A shiver ran down my spine.\n\nI stumbled towards a door at the end of the room, my bare feet slapping against the cold tile. My clothes were thin and flimsy, a pale blue gown that offered little warmth.\n\nWith trembling hands, I pushed the door open.\n\nA hallway stretched before me, equally sterile and silent. The only sound was the rhythmic hum of the machinery, a constant, unsettling pulse.\n\nI had to get out. I had to find out what had happened to me. But where to go? And more importantly… who was I?\n\nThe chilling realization washed over me: I had woken up in a morgue drawer. And I had no idea why.\n"

But they didn't know the peace she found in his presence, the unwavering support he offered. This was right. This was her happiness.\n\nThe best man adjusted his tie, a nervous habit he’d never quite shaken. He scanned the crowd, a sea of familiar faces, and his gaze landed on him. Poor bastard. He knew the pain etched on his friend's face, the silent torment of unrequited love. He also saw her, radiant and beautiful, but with a subtle strain in her eyes. He'd always suspected she harbored a flicker of doubt, a lingering question mark beside her decision. He hoped, for everyone's sake, that he was wrong.

Maybe Pepsi *was* okay. Maybe it was more than okay. Maybe it was a reminder that sometimes, the small compromises were what allowed you to keep going.\n\nI took another sip of the Pepsi. It still wasn’t Coke. But it was cold, and sweet, and on a rainy night in a crowded diner, it was enough. Brenda came back to refill my water. She gave me a small, knowing smile.

Tone it down. Focus on one dominant color. The tree is cool, though.”\n\nI stared back at the drawing. Liam was right, it did feel a bit frantic. Maya's suggestion sparked an idea, but Chloe's comment about the tree resonated. It *was* the best part. Maybe focusing on its solitude would give the image more impact.\n\nArmed with this unsolicited (but surprisingly helpful) feedback, I grabbed another pen and began to refine the doodle. The mountains softened, the sky darkened to a somber indigo, and I added a tiny, glowing bird perched on one of the branches. It was still chaotic, still a little rough around the edges, but now, at least, it had a story to tell. And that, I decided, was enough.

They spoke of appeasing the spirits of the vanished people, of acknowledging their existence and mourning their fate.\n\nOne warrior, a young man named Ikal, discovered a mosaic depicting a gruesome scene. Pale figures lay strewn across the ground, their bodies marked with dark, swollen sores. Fear gripped his heart.

No more rom-coms, okay? Tonight, we watch a horror flick.\" She paused, a playful glint in her eyes. \"After all, I need some inspiration.\"\n"

    "HWT": "Sirta had been born under a bad omen. The clan just did what they always had done and threw her over the threshold. The people under a bad omen were a threat and had been put in that magical area were nothing can escape once it gets in. The village was safe in that area, the child not so much. Sirta was fed (the village were not savages, they used to just starve these people, but these days, they even allowed them to survive) and learned to scavage, she was not spoken to, but she learned speech from hearing the others. When she spoke to them, they told each other how horribly inappropriate she had just been.\n\nShe tried to be useful to the village by waking them when the jackals were about to attack at night, and it even led to a bit of appreciation, until once, she confused a group of housecats with jackals. The vllagers even threw stones at her and insulted her. It was the only imes they talked to her so she became more unpleasant and caused more problems by being loud, rude and angry. I relished the attention I got. For the first time I was a presence, not an absence. That is how they call the area beyond the threshold: the Absence.\n\nThese days, I don't even do this, the stones left me bruised for too long. I just gave up. Even when thy gave me positive attention, I kept to myself and instead tried to define myself as myself, not as the area they threw me in as a child. I walked away from the village. Maybe I was not the first one who was thrown in here.",
    "MGT": "The blank page mocked me. It always did. Every morning, I’d sit at my desk, the aroma of stale coffee clinging to the air, and stare. I was supposed to be a writer, a weaver of worlds, a conjurer of emotions. Instead, I was a prisoner of my own fear.\n\nThe fear started subtly. A whisper of doubt after a rejection, a prickle of anxiety before hitting \"publish.\" But it grew, metastasized into a monstrous entity that choked my creativity. Each word felt scrutinized, each sentence judged, each story destined for failure.\n\nI tried everything. Writing prompts, freewriting exercises, even therapy. Nothing worked. The fear clung tighter, a parasite feeding on my passion. I considered giving up. Selling my laptop, finding a \"real\" job. Anything to escape the torment.\n\nThen, one day, I stumbled upon a quote: \"The only way out is through.\" It was simple, almost cliché, but it resonated. I closed my eyes, took a deep breath, and started typing. No editing, no second-guessing, just letting the words flow.\n\nIt wasn't perfect. It was messy, raw, and vulnerable. But it was mine. And for the first time in a long time, the blank page didn't feel like a battlefield. It felt like a canvas. The fear was still there, lurking in the shadows, but it wasn't in control anymore. I was writing again. And that was enough.\n"
